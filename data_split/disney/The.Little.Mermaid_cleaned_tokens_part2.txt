music wrote first source piece animate right know talked grieg although really know grieg yeah sort little bit hall mountain king grieg danish made sense somehow one difficult characters film prince eric tradition disney princes worked well cinderella talked eric larson animated said yeah stiff really get right animating prince called thankless job animation probably harder character even andersen fairytale get much sense prince much little mermaid challenge realistic human characters always difficult still character like ariel still fun particularly ariel great heroine least extra aspect part fish could swim underwater move ways humans possibly move screen time tends limited difficult matt callaghan animated prince mike cedeno christopher barnes voice prince think really nice

effects animation fact done first really gave us chance go mark dindal head effects movie great job sequence gray green cast skies inspired n c wyeth painting done think kidnapped one shipwrecked figure foreground ship background inspiration visual look sequence never successful solution scene directed sequence wanted able see statue sank cheated statue floating minute marble statue made sense whatsoever figure show goes away bizarre water animation beautifully done water difficult animate convincingly ted kierscey lot lot animators funny score sequence like every hit becomes source stress
