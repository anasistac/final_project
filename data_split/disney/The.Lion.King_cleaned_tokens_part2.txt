african american yet niketa calame african american growing moira kelly big jumble big mix characters things interesting film could really literally color blind far mattering really character performer brought character almost nice commentary everyone voice blended together create piece theater also jonathan taylor thomas voice actor simba go song becomes jason weaver right yeah played michael jackson thing going wait king one first songs came meant kind peppy upbeat kids point view africa challenge always try reflect art direction production designer chris sanders took challenge created look song pretty unique rest film right supposed really literally simba point view idea evoke brighter colors bolder patterns shapes would feel childlike interestingly knew departure make terms going reality fantasy decided bring audience abrupt change would aware literally change tempo tone idea idea kind trees going got simba nala chasing one direction palm trees panning direction

normally special effects think rocket ships laser guns big explosions absolutely true also animation kind side lighting shadow subtlety almost every shot lion king form special effect sequence like seems fairly simple loaded shadows tone mattes lighting effects make character really feel like environment tone mattes shadowed areas characters define character three dimensional form especially film lions one color tone mattes gave internal shadows bodies would come looking flat yellow gold orange yellow yellow yellow brown yellow orange yeah effects department pretty much drew shadows characters throughout whole movie fun task boy really made everybody become three dimensional also see terms like cap system zazu bill goes yellow orange blend happening two colors something able computer done five years ago fantasia back 40s would airbrushed would crawled around fragile get lovely blended look great remember one day working movie trying figure cast several parts peter
