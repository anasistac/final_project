putting also mufasa killed right long mufasa killed feeling like late makes much sense plotting song really get juices going takeover moved earlier melody stuck track hans zimmer weekend left studio friday night said hans give us kind fun sinister cirque du soleil thing fact think even said think left alone came back basically hear today carnival hell one carnival hell brief came back monday morning played us pretty amazed one great storyboard artists jorgen klubien took material andy gaskill art director inspired leni riefenstahl kind fascist documentary stuff thought maybe could layer idea scar fascist dictator whole dynamic movie well idea introduced yellow lights give colors like old news reel colored everything kind old browny yellows like dirty old yellows black like old news reel especially mud scene director cut replace yeah lot debate scene previews whether appropriate much would lean direction kind fascist fascism parade kind thing kind turns bacchanal hell carnival mardi gras graveyard feeling earthquake based rob backyard earthquake actually funny early demos song rob roger us sing long time workshopping trying get songs hyenas right tim rice sang scar part beautifully three us hyenas right fact think survived hyenas laughing laughing still soundtrack samples hans zimmer sitting keyboard studio sample sounds playing whole thing shot moving shadows cliffs cloud shadows moving across serengeti another mark henn andreas deja scene mark animating simba andreas animating scar shows great vocal performance props characters props hold things hands standing hands opposable thumb thing think interesting note long scenes tried stay characters stay shot rather cutting things really give chance characters let perform get across another tip hat jeremy irons think recording session would give us 10 15 20 takes different color line every time editor tom finan would work directors put performance together sounded cohesive jeremy terrific hey uncle scar like surprise simba die actually thing really trying sequence got several storylines going set different things important actually keep thread moving throughout carried sort seamless way leads us probably centerpiece movie certainly turning point movie wildebeest stampede originally storyboarded thom enriquez career long move thom took probably year half almost whole career movie stampede turned cg department computer graphics department animators technical directors ones responsible bringing wildebeest stampede life screen movie wildebeests turning pride rock also water wait king kind effects would see ballroom beauty beast flying carpet aladdin kind unique character situation handled help computer scott johnston cgi supervisor wrangled whole thing really project took full three years production amounts six seven minutes screen really amazing beasts really based singular run cycle created cgi department added different behaviors like bucks kicks different things head shakes changing leads yeah program invented something called avoidance program would send wildebeest literally moving towards would always turn away last minute really replicated real stampede would got thousands beasts running going constantly try avoid getting complete sense would look like interesting reason computer recognize three dimensional objects computer would actual beast crossing like ghosts order occupy space program underlines natural behavior beasts odd first time us really tackled flesh blood characters animated computer reason computer graphics guys way would impossible actually sit draw tens thousands wildebeest storming gorge jonathan taylor thomas falling way way actually pick fling around recording studio could get screams yells first scene put color zazu hitting wall really interesting little scene goes fast camera dollies left right sea wildebeests goes really fast actually sophisticated scene seeing entire herd running changing perspective camera dollies follow mufasa mufasa doubles back save simba something would simple live action animation really go way replicate combination computer generated wildebeest hand drawn animation simba mufasa scar artwork course would drawn hand effects animators putting shadows turbulence dust top put together hand painted background created pretty amazing effect hans zimmer wrote piece score remember night went studio heard first time probably one powerful pieces music ever experienced yeah musically hans went south africa london lot voices hearing track combination london choral group singing south african singers give really panicked kind soundtrack big debate trying figure simba see death father try sidetrack simba enough climbing cliffs rocks see crucially scenes coming important see right cause guilt trip work scene decided one longer scenes decided really wanted hold shot allow simba move whole sense three dimensional space really believe really way convey space animation allow character move within three dimensions exist scene coming simba confronts body father spent lot time story previewing discussion animated several versions mark henn went anguish trying get right mixture pathos emotion make moment work tribute craftsmen coming together cause staging layout people beautifully certainly direction makes poignant moment jonathan acting part thought try real animal sounds oh god right recorded whimperings lion cubs cause thought really sad know feel animal whimperings frank welker frank welker talented voice artist town came whimpered half hour thought going really sad cut weird even though lions human story rob came one day saw rescue 911 something remember talking woman whose daughter fell swimming pool something running around going help please somebody help kind panicked attitude know turn shouting help maybe help kind spawned idea simba running around knows hopeless still looking maybe last chance father could alive one sensitive issues film literally dealing death whether deal screen choice made bambi decided go purposefully opposite direction specific reason allow simba confront issue death real personal immediate way especially going issue deal rest picture whole idea simba guilt materialized little later game original notion scar would actually wind simba make simba believe father death actually somehow fault story developed became pretty central really necessary always problem simba go back home ran away gone always problem motivates stay away simba bad day know one thing another also interesting think stories track terms time condensed yeah two days beginning movie takes place two days interesting whole area movie actually animated flopped reversed right left simba escaping right left movie reels pretty deep process guys looked one day said know established pumbaa timon jungle always screen right simba escaping left whole chunk flopped actually really think completely unnecessary fact think think go back way well okay whoopi interesting recorded separately cheech one time got together great together time record separately yet still sounds like room together know works yeah think actually something people aware much almost actors separately basically bring together editing room see simba clearly escaping screen right later find pumbaa timon right song yes reprise prepared use musically use even imagined reprise scar song prepared scar ushers hyenas seemed bit much stage wait something lively mood needed come death activity needed low point also rubbing audience nose death showed movie amc burbank preview michael roy disney michael big thing seeing movie love rafiki great character get movie see enough see character threaded movie enough lot moments particularly one mourning loss simba kind come rebuilding preview used sequence could ruminate simba lost alone inhospitable waste little sequence sand dunes walking desert kind lawrence arabia thing simplified using icon simba transition apparently dead simba know think boy bad day mean bad day interestingly enough vultures used characters right yeah long ago tried bunch different kinds vultures tried vultures newscasters old yiddish vultures radio announcer vultures black humor talking hey kid might well give ready going eat looking good yeah like scene played vultures characters funny really funny funny kind stole thunder pumbaa timon knew audience rooting pumbaa timon introduced vultures would never pay later ended making real vultures make sinister yeah funny story nathan lane ernie sabella came audition new york hyenas think nathan also came auditioned zazu role los angeles listening tapes trying figure timon pumbaa listened nathan ernie hyena audition funny funny together played together well
