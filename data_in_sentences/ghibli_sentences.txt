The Wind Rises The wind is rising!
We must try to live.
Paul Valery Jiro, here it is.
Would it be alright if I borrow it?
It's not Japanese.
That's okay.
I have a dictionary.
Alright then, give it a try.
Thank you.
Knock it off.
Stay out of it, Jiro!
Go home!
Now!
Jiro...
He's half your size, Katayama.
Ah...you look quite the hero.
No, I just slipped and fell.
Fighting is never justified.
Yes, mother.
Alright. now you can go have your snack.
Thanks.
Jiro, you're home!
Welcome home.
Oh, Jiro , now we can pick some bamboo grass.
Jiro!
Wait, where are you going?
You promised to pick bamboo grass today.
I got homework.
What kind of homework is that?
It's an English magazine.
Oh, look at that stupid moustache.
He's a very famous Italian aircraft designer.
His name is Caproni.
Wow, it says he's a count.
What happened?
Your face is scratched.
Leave it alone, Kayo!
You should put iodine on it.
I'll do it for you.
Would you cut it out!
What are you doing up here?
You're not suppose to be up here.
Where are your glasses?
I heard you can fix your eyesight by focusing very intently on the stars.
Mom will be mad if you're not in your bed.
I see a shooting star!
Oh, there's another one.
Ah, they're pretty.
Oh, look at that one!
Wow, there's so many of them.
I'm a Japanese boy.
I'm dreaming.
I think this is my dream.
This is my dream, you know.
I think it's mine too.
Your dream?
Listen, Japanese boy.
So you think we are sharing this dream?
I hope so.
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?
I've been reading all about you.
Interesting.
Yes, this is a dream.
This world is a dream.
Welcome to my kingdom.
I'm honored.
Look at them.
They will bomb an enemy city.
Most of them will never return.
Well, it'll all be over very soon.
Come on up, Japanese boy.
This is my true dream.
When the war is over, I'll build this.
What do you think?
Magnificent, isn't she?
Let's take off.
Instead of bombs, she'll carry passengers.
I find dreams are a good way to see my designs.
I can go anywhere.
Come on, walk along the spar, Japanese boy.
Look at that.
She's beautiful, yes?
Yes, incredible.
She'll carry a hundred people across the Atlantic.
Mr.
Caproni, may I ask you a question?
I know I can't be a pilot because of my eyesight.
If I'm not a pilot, can I still design airplanes?
Japanese boy, I've been around planes all my life.
You know how many I've flown?
None!
Not any one!
Many can fly a plane but I design them.
I create airplanes and so can you.
An aeronautical engineer!
Yes!
But remember this, Japanese boy.
Airplanes are not tools for war.
They are not for making money.
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
Engineers turn dreams into reality.
Yes!
Arrivederci.
We'll meet again.
Jiro, you were talking in your sleep.
You were smiling.
You must be having the most wonderful dream, Jiro.
Mother, I'm going to be an aeronautical engineer.
Oh, that does sound like a good dream. (sigh) He told me that airplanes are beautiful dreams.
So I'm going to make beautiful airplanes.
Excuse me Miss, please, take my seat.
Pardon me, sir.
I insist. (French) The wind feels wonderful.
Miss, you'll lose your hat.
I got it.
Miss!
Miss!
Hold on!
Are you all right?
Safe!
Nice catch.
You speak French? "Le vent se lève." It's a French poem. "Il faut tenter de vivre." "Le vent se lève.
Il faut tenter de vivre." "The wind is rising.
We must try to live." Earthquake.
Get away!
The boiler's going to blow!
What's wrong?
Her leg.
Here, let me see.
Ah...
Be brave, Kinu.
It's broken.
She won't be able to walk.
Miss, the boiler.
Please save yourself, go!
That's nonsense.
Nothing's going to explode.
We need to brace her leg.
This will hurt a little, relax.
She can't walk on this.
Where do you live?
In Ueno.
Don't worry, I'll get you there.
Fire.
Let's go.
What about your luggage?
It's not important.
I'm so sorry.
You alright?
Okay.
Better hurry.
Here, my mother made me this shirt.
You must be thirsty.
Don't worry, it's clean.
The well's almost dry... and for you?
Please.
The fire hasn't reached Ueno and I'm heading for the university.
So, I can take you there.
And help bring someone, from my house.
Then we should get going, now.
Kinu, look after my suitcase.
Okay.
We'll bring someone to get you home.
I promise.
Stay strong.
Okay.
I will.
Thank you very much for helping us.
Take care of her.
But wait, at least tell us your name.
What a great guy.
Who was he, Kinu?
Well, it isn't Jiro.
You picked a lovely day to come back.
How bad is it, Honjo?
Bad enough.
The whole east side is burning.
We grabbed everything we could carry out of the library.
Got a smoke?
A flying door?
Don't see that everyday.
We'll never gonna stop the fire now.
Tokyo's finished.
It's as beautiful as it was in the dream.
I can't really believe he built it.
Cut!
Cut!
Cut!
Damn wind's picking up.
We need to hurry.
What do you think, Japanese boy?
Is the wind still rising?
Yes, it's a gale.
Well then, you must live. "Le vent se lève." "II faut tenter de vivre." Jiro, let's eat.
Look, even the new buildings are old-fashioned.
If the streets are a little wider.
So?
The airplanes are still old.
Welcome!
Oh look, Mackerel again?
Yeah, it's always good.
Always.
Always the same lunch, always the same Mackerel.
Kina, can you help me?
Coming up!
Meanwhile, other countries are building metal planes.
We're 10 years behind and you're still stuck with Mackerel.
What is that?
Beautiful, isn't it?
Look at that wonderful curve.
Only you would get a thrill from fish bones.
Come on, finish up.
I need a coffee.
What on earth is Jiro working so hard on?
Fish bones.
Is Mr.
Horikoshi back from lunch?
Jiro!
Honjo, listen to this.
The NACA has a standard wing cross-section just like the curve of this fish bone.
Maybe the Americans eat mackerel too.
Jiro, you got a visitor.
Yes?
A young lady came by and brought this package for you, Mr.
Horikoshi.
You were out, so she left it with me.
I see.
Thank you very much.
Ah, is that a present from your girlfriend, Jiro?
Can it, freshman, and give me a smoke.
Jiro!
Let him go.
Oh, Mr.
Horikoshi.
Yes, Mam?
You've a guest waiting for you upstairs.
It's a young lady.
Huh, young lady?
Hello?
Finally, where were you?
Kayo, I'm sorry.
Completely forgot.
I'm not surprise!
Where's mother?
At uncle's.
Is she staying there?
Just for a night.
Kayo, you've gotten so tall and very pretty too.
You're so insensitive.
I'm still mad at you 'cause you never come home!
Oh, the sun is already down.
I'm going to be late.
I'll tell them it's my fault.
Don't worry.
We'll take the penny steamer.
I think she must really like you.
I don't know, it's been over two years.
Didn't you ever try to see her again?
I did.
I went back after the fire was out.
Her house has burnt down.
That's terrible.
Here, let's catch this one.
Are you cold, Kayo?
I'm fine.
I didn't think Tokyo would recover so quickly.
Jiro, maybe I can stay here with you?
Father won't let me live here by myself.
Well, I might be at Nagoya by the time you come.
With an airplane company?
I hope so.
Men have it so good.
Why can't I live in Tokyo and go to medical school?
Medical school?
You should— I think you'd be a great doctor.
I think so too.
When I'm home for New Years, I'll talk to father about it.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, Jiro!
Heavy?
Yep.
Glad you made it.
Me too.
We are just getting started.
We certainly are.
Well, they are probably heading for the city to look for work.
There are dozens of of them.
And there will be hundreds more.
Ah, looks like we lost another bank.
Tough time is coming, Hachi.
It's awful.
I'm so sad.
There were rumors.
The economy's in the tank.
I hate to break to you Jiro, but so is our new employer.
Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine CO.
You know the pressure we are under.
We needed you here over a month ago.
But sir, I was told I could start anytime in April.
Then you should've been here in March!
Yes, sir.
I got a very important assignment for you.
Yes, sir.
It's the design for the wing strut fitting and by the way, it's already late!
Yes, sir.
I need the plan in the shop as soon as possible.
Do what you have to do.
Yes, sir.
Here.
Let's get you ? specification.
Follow me.
This will be your desk.
It's imported, nobody likes it.
Maybe you will.
Yes, sir.
Work goes here, hat goes there.
Yes, sir.
Listen up!
This is the new engineer on the Falcon Project.
It's that genius we've been hearing all about.
Name?
Genius.
Jiro Horikoshi.
I'm very happy to be here. 234.1 Get to work.
Yes, sir. 234.1 And the rest of you, get back to work!
Jiro, Jiro.
Let's eat.
Let's go see the assembly floor.
Could we maybe have lunch first?
Maybe Kurokawa simply hates you.
Why else would he have you design that strut on your first day?
Two, please.
Excuse me.
Could we ask a slight favor?
Wow, it's really coming along.
Thank you again for making time for us on your break.
No problem at all.
You young engineers should visit here more often.
Honjo, look, the strut has already been installed.
I knew it.
Kurokawa is obviously just hazing you, unless his fitting is better than yours...
Mr.
Kurokawa is always tough on new employees.
Honjo, come up here and take a look.
Something is not right.
What do you think?
It looks all right to me.
No, this isn't good.
It got the same problem with my design.
Then it must be bad.
Foreman, lunch's over.
What's going on?
Quiet!
They are working.
I love it!
Airplanes are fascinating!
Yea, fascinating but we're late.
Young man.
This is our boss, Mr.
Hattori.
This is his first assignment?
Strut fitting for the Falcon Project, sir.
Not what I've expected.
What am I looking at here?
Sir, the steel leaf-spring will ease the stress from the wing.
This wire expands and contracts, absorbing the forces that act on the wing.
I have it running thru' the strut and anchoring it on the fuselage.
That means that we would have to entirely re-design the length of the wing!
You're right.
I'll run the calculations tonight, sir.
You're wasting your time.
Where's the assignment that I gave you this morning?
Right here, sir.
I finished it.
Well done.
What do you think, Kurokawa?
It's perfect.
Turn in your work as soon as you're done!
Yes, sir.
What a day, I'm heading out.
Me too.
Wild guess, you already finished Kurokawa's homework?
Just about.
What's the oxen for?
Oh, they haul the prototypes to the field.
Takes them two days to drag it out there.
You believe that?
That's how backward we are.
I don't know.
I like them.
Here she comes.
Almost here!
Almost here!
Damn it!
Tell me you got it? 13.3 seconds. 146 knots.
Blast.
She needs more horse power.
She deserves better.
Hey, Kurokawa!
Yes, sir?
A word with the clients.
Gentlemen?
Well done.
Yea, your Falcon is one hell of a plane!
And I bet Mitsubishi couldn't do it.
Now I'm buying drinks!
Power dive.
He's trying to break 200 knots.
The chute!
Go get him!
Mr.
Kurokawa, let's investigate what happened when the weather clears.
It would be easier.
How's the pilot?
He's okay.
That's good.
Let's go, Mr.
Kurokawa.
We'll regroup for Falcon Two.
Here you'll be straight with me.
Do you think the strut fitting failed?
No.
I think the problem here is much deeper and more complicated than we thought.
I'll never forget what I saw today.
It's like an endless road is opened up before my eyes.
There won't be a Falcon Two.
The Army has decided to go with the competing design.
Today was our last shot to change their minds.
We'll have to shift course.
We're gonna to design and build the heavy bomber, with help from the Germans.
You're going to Germany to study Junker's design.
I recommended you.
Still open?
Ah, welcome back.
Your usual?
Yea, but 2 slices this time.
Coming up.
Here you go.
Who looks after them?
Well, their parents work late.
They wait there every night.
I feel bad closing the place up.
I see.
Well, thanks.
See you tomorrow.
Are you hungry?
I've 2 slices of sponge cake.
You can have them.
It's okay, I just bought them.
Go ahead, take it.
Come on!
Jiro?
Wake up!
I heard they axed the Falcon Project.
I need details.
Sponge cake again?
How do you stay alive?
What did you expect?
Did you think she was just going to smile and say "thank you, sir" Of course not.
Well, maybe I did.
Well, if you're looking for a mouth to feed, there happen to be plenty of other hungry kids in this neighborhood.
And their parents are probably hungrier.
It's shameful.
I bet it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
I don't understand why this country is so poor.
Poor Jiro, stuck in his happy dreams.
For what Japan is paying the Germans, they could feed every man, woman and child a mountain of sponge cake.
But if this country wants airplanes, then I'm gonna make the most of it.
Really?
They're sending you too?
They told me today.
That's great.
The fact is this poor country pays us a lot of money to design war planes.
Embrace the irony.
I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow to get married.
Marry?
To work hard at the office, you need a family at home.
More irony for you.
Goodnight.
These tight-fisted Germans aren't letting us see any of Dr.Junker's work.
I don't see any oxen.
Jiro, the airstrip's right next to the plant.
Wow, everything's so big.
It's the G-38.
Is this what we're buying?
Yep, to convert to a bomber.
Who's The Army planning to bomb with this one?
America, probably.
Not that they could.
This is something.
It's amazing.
Look.
Passengers sit in the wings.
It would be a shame to put bombs there.
That's the job, pal.
This is our chance to get the all-metal technology.
What?
They're not letting us in?
Beautiful.
Take your hands off.
You've been slamming doors on our faces all day.
You Japanese copy everything.
All these technology belong to Germany.
Oh, I get it.
So you're afraid we'll actually improve it!
Honjo, let me talk to them. (German) We have a license to your technology.
Therefore we officiallly have a right to be in this hangar examining these airplanes.
I understand you're just doing your job, but please understand I'm just doing mine.
When I saw Dr.Junkers' single-engine plane, I had to get a closer look.
I'm not a soldier, simply an engineer admiring a fellow engineer's work.
And as soldier, my orders are not to leave you Japanese unattended.
That's Dr.
Junkers.
What an engineer.
Dr.
Junkers gave you permission to go inside.
So Jiro, what do you think?
There's more vibration than I expected.
Our bosses are kids in a candy store.
Hey, you two should let the Army reps sit here, okay?
Yes, sir.
Just one moment, please.
It's fantastic, what a fortress.
Look, you can walk thru' the wing.
It's amazing.
It's like being inside a power plant.
Guten tag.
We've permission to be here from Dr.
Junkers.
Would you mind telling us a bit about your station?
Here is the engineer's station.
It's such a marvelous aircraft.
Young man, you can't go any further.
We understand, my friend.
Are you seeing this?
It's incredible.
A triumph of German industrial technology.
Junkers let us in, the Germans shut us out!
These specs are useless!
Jiro, give me a cigarette.
Jiro!
Give me a smoke.
We're out.
It's cold outside but this room is quite cozy.
You know that Junkers make these radiators too?
Funny, they look just like his planes with such strong paralel lines.
Hmm...
Okay, I get it.
German's technology is so superior that they can put wings on anything and fly it, including their damn radiators.
Jiro, just give it a rest, please.
We can't learn anything from these government specs.
They're nothing but a bunch of pretty numbers. "This technology belongs to Germany." Honjô, maybe we don't need their technology after all.
Wood and canvas could be just as good as metal.
Jiro, we cannot be stuck in the past forever.
We're already 20 years behind!
Let's get some air.
My brain is going to explode.
It's as if we were a hare chasing a tortoise with a 20-year lead.
But in our little story, the hare doesn't sleep.
We can close the gap but how could we beat it?
We're too far behind.
We'll always be chasing it.
But what other choice do we have?
Keep running and catch up someday?
I wonder if there's a different way to run.
What is it?
Schubert's "Winter Journey".
Well, that's perfect for us.
Masterpiece of misery memoir.
What was that?
Secret Police.
We saw them in the hangar.
Jiro?
Jiro, I'm done.
The bath is yours.
Dead to the world... because he thinks he's shouldering the future of Japanese aviation.
There's a telegram from headquarters.
Come in.
No need.
Some of us will be returning to Japan right away.
You're staying here in Germany.
Jiro will continue west and return to Japan.
West?
They want him to see the world.
Alone?
Mr.
Caproni.
Is the wind still rising?
Yes sir, it sure is.
Then it's a perfect time to embark on my final flight.
Join me.
Wait, you're retiring?
It's a pretty big jump.
Come on, jump!
Why are you sitting there?
Let's go!.
There's a hatch underneath the fuselage.
Hurry up!
Yes, sir.
Let him through, girls.
Up here!
Come in!
Yeh!
Yeh!
These are all my workers and their families.
Practically the whole village.
I thought we take a little journey before we deliver this bomber to the government.
What do you think?
Incredible!
It's like a building out of ancient Rome.
This plane is too big to be used for fighting but the military has a weakness for big things.
Japan can never build anything as grand and as beautiful as this.
The country is too poor and backward Inspiration is more important than scale.
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology eventually catches up.
That's my family.
We Italians are very poor as well.
Too many mouths to feed.
Hey, settle down or the bottom will fall out.
Come on.
Be careful.
This may be a dream but you can still lose your head.
Which would you choose, a world with pyramids or without?
What do you mean?
Humanity has always dreamt of flight, but the dream is cursed.
My aircrafts are destined to become tools for slaughter and destruction.
I know.
But still, I chose a world with pyramids in it.
Which world will you choose?
I just want to create beautiful airplanes.
Like that?
Very graceful.
I have a long way to go.
I don't even have an engine or a cockpit yet.
Bravo!
A beautiful dream.
This is my last design.
Artists are only creative for ten years.
We engineers are no different.
Live your ten years well, Japanese boy.
Jiro, let's go get some coffee.
But I gotta go to a...
Cancel it.
This is a very tall order.
They're always tall.
How long have you been here, Jiro?
Jiro!
How long have you been here?
Five years.
Jiro, we're going to bid for the Navy's carrier base fighter.
We think we're ready to beat the Navy's chief designer.
It's a plum job.
It's a plum job!
What do you think?
Leave it to me, sir.
Good.
I'd like Honjo on the team, sir.
Not a good idea.
You'd just end up competing.
Friendships are always more important.
Relax, finish your coffee.
My check, please.
Kurokawa.
We've got other plans for your friend Honjo.
Damn these Japanese engines!
Damn these short runways.
I brought some clean uniforms.
Oh, thank you very much.
These are clean uniforms.
Yes, we are ready.
Man overboard!
Stop!
Whoa! (cheering on) Father!
Bravo!
That was a nice catch.
It nearly took you away.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Thank you.
I'll make sure that it stays grounded.
Yes, sir.
I feel bad.
I wanted to say thank you.
Nice young man.
Don't worry.
He's staying at our hotel.
You'll have a chance to say thank you.
What is it, dear?
There's something about that man who caught the parasol.
Oh, he seems to be here by himself.
I'm very sorry.
Please don't go.
I was giving thanks to the spring.
I asked it to bring you here.
I asked it to bring you to me.
You haven't changed at all from that day years ago.
You look just the same.
We were so grateful for your help after the earthquake.
I wanted to see you again and thank you.
Oh, I remember.
My name is Nahoko Satomi.
I'm Jiro Horikoshi.
This umbrella is useless.
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine.
Kinu searched for you for years.
Then she found you just before she got married.
She cried with joy after she dropped off your shirt.
You see, you were our knight in shining armor.
Your knight?
You, I think I remember you were on a white horse.
Well, I'm not doing much now to keep you dry.
It's okay.
I don't mind at all.
Kinu will be so excited when I tell her.
I found our hero again.
Oh, your painting is ruined.
No, it's not.
I'll always remember this day when I look at it.
Well, look, it's clearing up.
It's like another land!
Oh, Jiro, look!
I almost forgot what rainbows look like.
Life is wonderful, isn't it?
Oh, we should go.
My father's probably worried sick.
There he is.
Father!
Come with me.
I would really love to introduce you.
Of course.
You're soaking wet.
No, no, I'm fine.
I was just with Mr.
Horikoshi, he saved me again.
Jiro Horikoshi.
I'm Satomi.
It's so very good to meet you, Mr.
Horikoshi.
May I sit here?
Certainly.
German tobacco.
I've been saving it.
Last one.
I understand.
Japanese cigarette always taste like home to me.
You must've visited Germany, yes?
Perhaps to Dessau?
Oh, you must be Sherlock Holmes.
You read magazines.
German magazines about airplanes.
All Japanese engineers visit Dessau.
It's elementary, my dear Watson.
You cracked the case.
Dr.
Junkers is in trouble.
In trouble?
He fights the hand that feeds him and he will lose.
He fights Mr.
Hitler's government?
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.
This is quite a good place.
No mosquitoes.
Not too hot.
Good watercress.
A good place to forget bad things.
Isn't that right?
Cigarette?
I'm afraid they're Japanese.
Thank you.
It is a nice night. "Hier ist der Zauberberg." "The Magic Mountain" by Thomas Mann?
Yes, a good place for forgetting.
Make a war in China.
Forget it.
Make a puppet state in Manchuria.
Forget it.
Quit the League of Nations.
Forget it.
Make the world your enemy.
Forget it.
Japan will blow up.
Germany will blow up too.
Do you think Germany will go to war again?
Yes.
They must be stopped.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Naoko has a fever.
We'll have to cancel our dinner plans.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope that she feels better soon.
The doctor will be here soon.
I must go. "Who has seen the wind?" "Neither I nor you." "But when the leaves hang trembling, the wind is passing through." Let the wind carry these wings, carry these wings to you.
Jiro?
Naoko!
Be careful!
Nice catch.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Well, is your daughter feeling better?
Yes, thank you, much better.
Wonderful.
This is the magic mountain.
It cures everyone.
I think you're right.
At the begining, this young man was very gloomy.
Now he is very happy because he's in love.
Yes.
But summer love is seasonal.
You will go down the mountain and forget all about it.
That's not true.
This love of yours, it wouldn't be about my daughter, right?
Yes sir, I love her very much.
And I sincerely hope you'll approve, Mr Satomi.
Well, I don't, uh...
Father!
I would very much like to have your approval too.
Now, that's a beauty.
But Jiro, there's something I need you to understand.
Anything.
My mother died of tuberculosis two years ago.
And now I have it too.
Naoko, I'm in love with you.
Nothing ever going to stop me.
I've loved you since the day the wind brought you to me.
Will you please marry me.
Yes.
But I first I'm gonna get well.
Will you please wait for me?
I'll, even if it's gonna take a hundred years.
Congratulations.
He is a nice young man and your daughter is wonderful.
This is a summer to remember.
If it isn't the long lost Jiro!
Honjo!
When did you get back?
Two days ago.
Hot, isn't it?
Come, take a look at this.
She's beautiful.
Good clean lines.
They gave me free rein, so I designed something radical.
But it won't mount to anything if she doesn't fly.
Oh, I'm sure she'll fly.
I feel the wind rising.
Honjo, you've closed the gap and in one huge step.
My plane was just a tin duckling.
But here's an idea for you.
I thought of it too late to implement on my plane.
It's a way to reduce drag by using flathead screws on all the access hatches and the fueling port.
Maintenance will be easy with a hinge on one side.
I think a spring of this diameter should be fine.
Jiro, that's it!
What a great idea, as usual.
You should use it.
Thanks pal, but not this time.
I'll keep these, but I won't use them before you.
Your idea belongs in your next plane.
Thanks, Honjo.
You're welcome.
You better hurry up.
Jiro!
Where are you?
Mr.
Kurokawa.
Jiro.
Get back to the office!
Thanks.
I'm coming!
Come to the house for a drink next time.
Sure!
Jiro, you pedal.
The Secret Police are looking for you.
Oh, what?
Did you hear me?
The fight crime boys.
But why me?
Didn't ask.
I told them you were away.
They're just pretending to leave.
We won't fall for that.
You work up here today.
I've arranged it.
But why would they possibly be after me?
I don't understand.
They've already arrested some of my friends.
None of them understood why.
Enter.
Here's your stuff.
I think we got everything.
I can go back and check.
Nah, just leave it and go.
Jiro, the flange is here!
Can't wait to see it!
It's perfect.
Sure is.
I wish we had that a year ago.
So, what do you think, Jiro?
Our next plane won't just be a duckling, it'll be a full-grown duck.
A full metal duck.
Mr.
Kurokawa, what do you think?
I hope you youngsters appreciate the luxury of extruded aluminum alloy.
That's it, now back to work!
Alright, the coast looks clear.
Okay, Jiro.
You should keep a low profile for a few days, just in case.
We'll try to smooth things over.
I'll put you up at my house.
Can we stop at my apartment first?
I've to check my mail.
Is it sensitive?
Yes, it's very sensitive.
The police will be opening all your mail.
It's from my fiancée.
This is outrageous.
These things shouldn't happen in a modern country.
You're engaged?
You're a human after all.
I thought you would marry an airplane!
I don't find that very funny!
Of course it's not funny.
The police are waiting for you at your apartment.
If they want to read your love letters, let them!
Jiro, we need you to focus on the fighter project.
That's why we sent you away to rest after the crash.
The company will do everything to protect you.
If you keep your mind in your work.
I can't bear being apart from you.
Why do you suppose the police are looking for Mr.
Castorp?
He left so suddenly.
I pray everyday that he managed to leave Japan safely.
Jiro, you've a telephone call.
The telephone is over there.
Thank you, Mrs.
Kurokawa.
Hello?
Jiro?
It's me.
You have a telegram.
Yes?
Your landlord received it two days ago.
We just brought it in here now.
Would you please read it to me?
Now?
Yes "Nahoko...has had a lung...heh, heh... hemorrhage.
Satomi." Jiro?
Are you still there?
Thank you.
I've to go now.
Jiro, wait!
What is it?
Mrs.
Kurokawa, please, I need to know the quickest way to get to Tokyo!
Tokyo?
Today?
Yes, it's an emergency.
I have to be there as soon as possible.
Alright.
If you take the noon bus, then you'll just be able to catch the express. 716.1 I'll send someone to hold the bus for you.
Go get your things.
Thank you.
Jiya!
Darling!
I'm sorry I wasn't here sooner.
You'll catch it.
You're beautiful.
I love you.
Jiro?
Through the garden?
Come in, father.
Father, look who's here?
Jiro.
He came all the way from Nagoya but can't stay for long.
I'll be sure to use the front door the next time I come Hah, the garden, it's faster.
Okay, garden it is.
Take care, my darling.
Sleep well.
Goodnight, sir.
I'll see you out.
You better hurry if you gonna catch the last train.
I wish I could look after her, Mr.
Satomi.
She seems so tired.
The last thing Naoko wants is to be a burden to you.
You better go.
Naoko?
Are you alright?
I'm going to the sanatorium in the mountain, the one the doctor recommended.
Why?
It's so far and I don't want you to be alone.
Because I want to get better, father.
I want to have a life with Jiro.
Just made it.
The whole board is waiting.
So, are you ready?
Gentleman, I'll do my best.
Now you'll see the Navy.
They're the client.
Gentleman, I'll do my best.
You weren't even listening.
Nope.
So I gave up on that idea.
Very well, they're late.
Jiro's in the middle of a review with the design team.
I wanted this design to use the latest aeronautical advances.
Take a look.
Retractable undercarriage!
It's built to reach 270 knots. 270 knots?
That's 500 kilometers per hour!
But the Navy only asked for 220 knots. 220 will be obselete by next week.
The wing load is 120 kilos per square meter.
Minimal drag will be the key.
I pushed the design to the limit of technology, with split flaps and slats on the leading edges.
We can do it!
When do we start?
But the weight becomes the big problem.
One solution would be, we could leave out the guns.
So, I decided to put this design back on the shelf.
This is refreshing, delightful.
He nearly had it.
But we're not giving up because our engines are underpowered.
We'll build a light, strong air frame.
We'll cut every ounce of excess weight and minimize drag with a smooth skin.
We're going to build an all-metal fighter, like nothing the world has ever seen!
I have a question!
Mr.
Hirayama, please.
This is Mr.
Hirayama, he's our production engineer.
Thank you, sir.
He's going to tell us about the new rivets that he's developing.
I believe it's technically possible to match the strength of conventional rivets with flush rivets.
What's he talking about?
A new way to cut drag.
We're going to skin the entire plane with flush rivets to produce a nimble, fast aircraft.
Question!
I have a question!
I must say, that was interesting.
It was inspiring.
Miss Satomi, today's letter.
Thank you.
Chief, you've a phone call.
I'll have to call him back.
I think it's an emergency.
Hello, Mr.
Satomi.
Good to hear from you, sir.
Yes, yes, what?
Jiro!
I'm here now.
Jiro!
I'm here.
You alright, my love?
Can you walk?
Come.
I've to go back.
I just needed to see you.
No, don't go back.
We should be together.
Oh, you must be Naoko.
Please to meet you.
I'm so glad you're here.
Jiro.
Mr.
Kurokawa, we've a request.
We've plenty of room, dear.
I know we've the room, that's not the problem.
I simply can't approve an unmarried couple living under this roof.
Then we'll marry tonight.
Mr.
Kurokawa, Mrs.
Kurokawa, will you please be our witnesses.
What?
Tonight?
Of course we'll, dear.
Naoko travelled all this way, it's the least we can do.
My doctors know about this and my father has given his blessing.
Please, help us.
The bride and I have a lot of work to do, and so do you.
Come, Naoko.
Oh, don't mind him, he's always like that.
If you care about her at all, Jiro, you'll send her back on the morning train.
I'll have to give up the fighter project, Mr.
Kurokawa, because I would go with her.
Is that your heart or your ego talking?
Naoko doesn't have much time.
We've made our decision.
I see.
All right.
So I guess it's on with wedding!
Here they come.
She's coming!
Hear me!
I bring to you a lovely maiden who has come from the mountain to be with her beloved.
She has given up everything for him.
What say you?
Hear me!
The man I present is an insensitive charcoal head without even a home to call his own. but if that's what she wants, she can come in.
And then, they shall exchange the sacred vows.
You're beautiful.
Mr.
Kurokawa, Mrs.
Kurokawa.
All Jiro and I've in this world is each other, I cannot thank you enough for your kindness.
We will never forget our debt to you.
Nonsense, there's absolutely no debt to repay.
We're both so happy that you've found each other.
Aren't we, dear?
Um...hmm, you both are very, very brave!
You must be exhausted.
I feel like I'm in a wonderful dream.
Feel like the room is spinning.
You should try to get some rest.
Come here.
Are you sure?
Come here.
Kayo!
You're going to tell me you completely forgotten I was coming?
Yes, I completely forgot you were coming.
You're so insensitive.
Congratulations on finishing medical school.
Congratulations on your marriage to Naoko.
I've come to thank Mr. and  Mrs.
Kurokawa on behalf of the entire family.
Are they still up?
They've gone to bed.
So, you've met Naoko?
Yes.
Jiro, what're you going to do?
She's alone in that room all day.
You won't know it because you come home so late!
Do you know she puts rouge on her cheek so that you won't worry?
Naoko condition is much worse than you think, Jiro.
I know because at school I watch these people...
She's my sister now.
I really like her.
How can you do this to her?
Does Naoko really have to stay here?
Yes.
She does because each day together is very precious to us now.
Get some rest.
We can talk more in the morning.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm home.
I must have dozed off.
Go back to sleep.
Thank you.
Did you see your sister?
Yes.
I like her a lot.
So confident and strong.
She has got such a bright future ahead of her.
I told her I wanted her to be my doctor.
She brought me a gift from your mother, this nightgown and robe.
See, she made it for me.
Is that too bright?
No, it's fine.
I have to finish the design by tomorrow.
Your Mackerel bones?
You remembered.
I think I may have a way to make it a bit lighter.
Come a little closer.
Give me your hand.
This is nice.
I really like looking at you while you're working, Jiro.
On a contest for one-handed slide rule users, I'd win first prize for sure.
Look at that, I can make each rib half an ounce lighter.
You can?
That's good.
Thirty ribs, that almost make a pound.
See, I knew it.
You were better when you're holding my hand.
You're right.
If only I could leave my hand right here for a test flight.
You my dear, should get some sleep.
Don't let go.
No, I won't let go.
I need a cigarette.
Can I let go for a minute?
No, smoke here.
It's not good for you.
I don't care.
Hey, Honjo.
Can I take a look?
Sure.
I hear good things about your heavy bomber.
Ah, it's not bad.
Jiro, she's beautiful.
The infamous flush riveting.
Feels a little rough.
Yea, we're still learning how to do it.
Well, you'll get it.
You already left the Germans behind.
I'm still stuck with them.
This design is classic Jiro, right down to the Mackerel bones.
Jiro, is it alright if I use your flush rivets and that spring-loaded hatch.
Um...hmm, of course.
Skeched a redesign?
Yeah, I wanted to redo the whole thing, but they only let me touch the fuselage.
But, what about the wings?
That's what keeps me up at night.
The wings still carry all the fuel and I can't shield them because she has to fly over 1,800 miles.
It's already too heavy.
We can't even add an ounce of weight.
So without a redesign, Japan's first advance bomber only needs two or three hits and she will burn like a torch.
And who are they going to bomb with it?
China.
Russia.
Britain.
The Netherlands.
America.
Japan will blow up.
We're not arms merchants.
We just want to build good aircraft.
That's right.
Good night, pal.
Try to get some sleep.
You too.
Boss, I'm calling it a day.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Welcome home.
My plane is finished.
Now we'll see how she flies.
Congratulations.
You worked so hard.
The oxen are taking her way to the field now.
I'll probably have to spend the next few nights there.
You must be tired, my love.
Just a little.
She will fly beautifully.
Hmm, she will.
I couldn't have done it without you here.
I love you, Jiro.
Naoko...
I'm off.
Good luck.
What are you doing up?
I'm feeling so much better today, Mrs.
Kurokawa, I thought I'd take a walk.
Be careful, don't tire yourself out.
I know.
The room's still a mess but I'll straighten it up when I get back.
All right but remember, Kayo's coming soon to be here for her brother's celebration.
Yes.
I'll be back soon.
Please come inside.
Oh, no. she left us letters!
This letter is for me.
Says she's going back to the sanatorium!
I'll find her.
No!
Let her go.
We shouldn't do anything until after Naoko's train leaves.
She wants him to always remember her as she was.
Wonderful, just look at her, true Japanese fighter.
What about speed?
How she do?
The numbers, they're off the charts.
We're checking them again.
How fast is she? 240.
Two forty?
Fantastic!
What a fighter.
Hey, Jiro.
Jiro!
She flies like a dream.
Thank you.
So, we meet again, Japanese boy.
Mr.
Caproni...
I remember this place.
This is where we first met in our kingdom of dreams.
Now it's the land of the dead.
Not quite but in some ways, yes.
But what about your ten years in the sun, did you live them well?
Yes.
Things fell apart in the end, though.
That's what happen when you lose a war.
There's your fighter.
Truly, truly a masterful design.
Not a single one returned.
There was nothing to return to.
Airplanes are beautiful curse of dreams, waiting for the sky to swallow them up.
Someone is waiting for you.
Naoko...
She's been waiting here for a long time.
You must live, darling.
You must live...
She was beautiful, like the wind.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You must live.
But now, shall we drop by my house?
I've some very excellent wine.

GOOD LUCK, CHIHIRO WE'LL MEET AGAIN Chihiro.
Chihiro!
We're almost there.
This really is the middle of nowhere.
I'll have to shop in the next town.
It'll be great, once we get used to it.
Look, there's the school.
That's your new school, Chihiro.
It doesn't look so bad.
I liked my old school...
Mommy...
My flowers died.
No wonder, the way you clung to them.
A little water when we get there and they'll perk right up.
My very first bouquet is farewell flowers, how sad.
What about that rose you got for your birthday.
One rose isn't a bouquet.
You dropped your card.
I'm opening the window.
C'mon now, behave yourself.
It's a big day for all of us.
SPIRITED AWAY Hey...
Did I take the wrong turn?
I don't get it.
That must be it, look.
It must be that blue one over there.
That's it.
I must've missed the exit.
I bet this road'll get us there.
This is always how you get us lost.
Just a little farther, OK.
What are those little houses?
They're shrines.
People pray to them.
Daddy, are we lost?
We're fine, we've got four-wheel drive.
Sit down, Chihiro.
You're going to kill us.
A tunnel.
What's this strange building?
Must be the entrance.
Honey...
Let's go back, honey.
Chihiro.
No...
It's just plaster.
This building's pretty new.
The wind's going in.
What is it?
Let's have a look.
There's a way through.
It's creepy, Daddy, let's go back.
No need to be scared.
Just a little farther, OK?
The moving van'll get there before us.
So, let 'em, they've got the keys.
Let the movers move us.
I know, but...
No!
I won't go.
Daddy, let's go back.
Nothing to be scared of.
I won't go.
Chihiro, you wait in the car.
Mommy.
Wait.
Watch your step.
You'll make me trip, Chihiro, clinging like that.
Where are we?
Say, do you hear that?
It's a train.
Maybe we're near the station.
Let's go and find out.
What are those houses doing here?
I knew it.
This must be an abandoned theme park.
They built so many in the early '90s, but they all went down with the economy.
This must be one of 'em.
What!
No.
Let's go back, Daddy.
C'mon.
Mommy, that building's moaning.
It's just the wind.
What a lovely spot.
We should've brought our lunch with us.
They were making a river.
Hey, you smell that?
See, it smells great.
You're right.
Maybe they're still open.
Hurry up, Chihiro.
Wait for me.
This way.
Can you believe it, they're all restaurants.
Where is everybody?
Over there.
Hey.
In here.
How amazing!
Hello, anybody here?
Come in, Chihiro, it looks delicious.
Hello!
Oh, don't worry.
We can pay them when they get back.
You're right.
That one looks great...
I wonder what this is called.
Delicious!
Chihiro, taste it.
I don't want to.
Let's go!
They're gonna be mad at us.
Don't worry, you've got Daddy here.
I've got credit cards and cash.
Take some, Chihiro, it's so tender.
Mustard.
Thank you.
Mommy!
Daddy!
OIL OIL OIL Weird...
OIL BATHHOUSE There's a train.
You're not allowed here.
Go back.
Wha-- It's almost night!
Leave before it gets dark.
BATHHOUSE They're lighting the lamps.
Go.
I'll distract them.
Get back across the river.
OIL What's his problem?
Daddy.
Daddy, let's go home.
Let's go, Daddy.
Daddy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
It's water.
This can't be...
I'm dreaming, dreaming.
Wake up!
Wake... up...
It's just a dream, a dream.
Go away, disappear.
Disappear.
I can see through.
It's a dream, it's got to be.
Don't be afraid, I'm a friend.
No, no, no.
Open your mouth and eat this.
Unless you eat something from this world, you'll vanish.
No!
Don't worry.
It won't turn you into a pig.
Chew it and swallow.
Good girl, you're fine.
See for yourself.
I'm back again...
You see?
Now come.
What about my mom and dad?
They didn't really turn into pigs, did they?
You can't see them now, but you will.
Quiet.
It's looking for you.
There's no time, let's run.
I...
I can't stand!
Oh, no.
My legs don't work.
Calm, now.
Take a deep breath.
In the name of the wind and the water within thee...
Unbind her.
Get up.
NO ENTRY OIL Hold your breath while we're on the bridge.
Even a tiny breath will break the spell and the attendants will see you.
I'm scared.
Be calm.
Welcome.
Always nice to see you.
Welcome.
I'm back from my task.
Welcome back, sir.
A deep breath...
And hold...
Welcome back!
We missed you!
Hang on, we're almost...
Master Haku.
Where have you...
Wha...
A human.
Run.
What...
Master Haku!
Chase after it.
A human intruder.
I smell humans!
The stench of humans.
They know you're here.
I'm sorry, I took a breath.
No, Chihiro, you did very well.
Listen and I'll tell you what to do.
Stay here, and they'll find you.
I'll distract them.
In the meantime, you escape.
No, don't go!
Stay with me, please.
You have no choice, if you want to survive here.
And save your parents, too.
So they did turn into pigs...
I wasn't dreaming...
Be still...
When things quiet down, go out by the back gate.
Take the stairs, all the way down.
Until you reach the boiler room, where they stoke the fires.
Kamaji's there, so look for him.
Ask him for work.
Kamaji?
Even if he refuses, insist.
If you don't work, Yubaba will turn you into an animal.
Yubaba.
You'll see.
She's the sorceress who rules our world.
Kamaji will turn you away, trick you into you leaving, but keep on asking him for work.
It'll be hard work, but it will give you a chance.
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.
OK.
Master Haku.
I have to go.
Remember, Chihiro.
I'm your friend.
How do you know my name?
I've known you since you were small.
My name is Haku.
Here I am!
Master Haku, Yubaba wants you.
I know.
It's about my task.
Um...
Excuse me.
Um...
Um, are you Kamaji?
Um, Haku sent me here.
Please let me work here.
Darn, all at once...
Get to work, you little runts.
I'm...
Kamaji.
Slave to the boilers that heat the baths.
Step on it, boys.
Um, please let me work here.
I've got all the help I need.
The place is full of soot.
Plenty of replacements.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Please wait.
Outta the way.
Um...
What should I do with this?
Do I just leave it?
Finish what you start.
Hey, you runts!
Wanna turn back into soot?
And you, watch it.
You can't just take someone's job.
If they don't work, the spell wears off.
Got no work for you here.
Look elsewhere.
You sootballs got a problem?
Get to work!
To work.
Chow time.
What?
You guys at it again.
Cut it out.
Where's your bowl?
I keep telling you to leave it out.
Meal time!
Take a break!
A human!
You're in trouble.
They're having a fit about it upstairs.
That's my granddaughter.
Granddaughter?
Says she wants to work, but I've got all the help I need.
Would you take her to Yubaba?
The girl can handle her, I'm sure.
Not a chance!
And risk my life?
Take this, then.
A roasted newt.
Real quality.
If you want to work, you'll have to make a deal with Yubaba.
Might as well try your luck.
Fine!
You there, follow me.
Can't you even manage a "Yes ma'am," or "Thank you"?
Yes... yes ma'am.
You sure are slow.
Hurry.
Yes ma'am.
What do you need shoes for!
Or socks!
Did you even thank Kamaji?
He's looking out for you.
Thank you very much, sir.
Good luck.
Yubaba lives way up at the top, in the back.
Get over here.
You wanna lose your nose?
We're almost there.
Right.
Here we are.
Wel... welcome.
This elevator is not in service, sir.
Please use another.
DOWN ONLY He's following us...
Quit gawking.
UP Here we are.
Your room is on the right.
Lin.
Yes.
What's that smell?
It's human.
You reek of human.
Is that so?
I smell it, I do.
Smells mighty tasty, too.
You're hiding something.
Tell me the truth, now.
This smell.
Roasted...
Gimme.
Not a chance.
It's for the other girls.
I'm begging you.
I'll settle for a leg.
Anyone going up, pull down on the lever.
SECOND SKY SKY OIL Not going to knock?
What a pathetic little girl.
Come closer...
I said closer.
Ow...
You're making a racket.
Keep it down.
Um...
Please let me work here.
Stop babbling.
You're just a useless weakling.
Besides, this is no place for humans.
It's a bath house, where eight million spirits can rest their weary bones.
Your parents had some nerve.
Gobbling up our guests' food like pigs!
Just desserts, I'd say.
And you'll never see... your world again either.
You'd make a lovely piglet.
Or maybe a lump of coal.
I see you're trembling.
Actually, I'm impressed you made it this far.
Someone must've helped you.
I must thank your friend.
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me.
Please let me work here.
Not that again!
I want to work here!
Shut up!
Why should I hire you?
Anyone can see you're a lazy, spoiled, crybaby.
Stupid to boot.
I've nothing for you.
Forget it.
I've got all the bums I need around here.
Or maybe you'd like the worst, nastiest job I've got, until you breathe your very last breath?
Stop that!
What's wrong...
I'll be right there.
That's a good baby, now.
What?
You still here!
Get out.
I want to work here.
Don't shout.
I'll be right there...
That's a good baby, there, there.
Please let me work!
OK, OK, just pipe down.
There, there, now.
Your contract.
Sign your name.
I'll put you to work.
But one peep out of you about anything, and I'll turn you right into a piglet.
Um, I sign my name here?
That's right.
Quit dilly-dallying and do it.
Unbelievable.
That ridiculous oath I took.
To give a job to whoever asks.
Signed it?
Yes.
You're Chihiro, huh?
Yes.
What an extravagant name.
CHIHIRO SEN From now on, you'll be Sen.
You got that?
You're Sen.
Answer me, Sen.
Yes...
Did you call?
This child's starting work as of now.
Look after her.
Yes.
Your name?
What?
Chi...
Oh, I'm Sen.
Follow me, then, Sen.
Haku...
Um...
No idle chatter.
Call me Master Haku.
Even on Yubaba's orders...
We can't allow humans.
Her contract's signed.
What...
Thank you, everyone.
Don't send her to us.
Can't bear that human stink.
Three days of eating our food and her smell will vanish.
If she's still useless then, fry her, boil her, do with her as you will.
Back to work!
Where's Lin?
Don't dump her on me.
You wanted help?
That's right, Lin's just perfect.
Go, Sen.
Yes, Sir.
What a pain.
You're gonna pay for this.
Off you go.
C'mon.
So you pulled it off, huh?
You're so thick, I was worried.
Keep your wits, now.
If you need something, ask me, OK?
What's wrong?
I'm dizzy.
So this is our room.
A little food and some sleep and you'll be fine.
You wash your own apron!
Pants.
You're so puny.
Too big...
Um, Lin...
What?
Are there two Hakus here?
Two?
Of him?
I sure hope not.
Still too big.
He's Yubaba's henchman.
Watch out for him.
Where the...
Here it is.
What's wrong?
Are you OK?
What's all the fuss, Lin?
New girl.
Says she feels faint.
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll show you your mother and father.
My shoes...
Thank you.
BATHHOUSE BATHHOUSE Follow me.
Daddy, Mommy, it's me.
It's Sen.
Mommy, Daddy.
Are they sick or hurt?
No, they ate too much.
Sleeping it off.
They don't even remember being human.
Daddy, Mommy, I promise I'll save you.
Don't get too fat, or they'll eat you.
Hide these.
I thought they were gone.
You'll need them to get home.
This was a farewell card...
Chi-hi-ro.
Chihiro...
That's my name.
Yubaba rules others by stealing their names.
You're Sen here, but keep your real name a secret.
She almost got mine.
I'd nearly turned into Sen.
If she steals your name, you'll never find your way home.
I no longer remember mine.
Your real name?
But it's strange.
I remembered yours.
Go ahead, eat, you must be hungry.
I don't want to.
I put a spell on it to give you back your strength, eat it.
You've had a hard time.
Eat some more.
OIL Can you find your way back?
Yes, Haku, thank you.
I'll work very hard.
Good.
Where were you?
I was worried.
I'm sorry.
Outta my way.
Is that the best you can do?
You and Sen get the big tub as of today.
What!
But that's Frog work.
Orders from the top.
Better give it your all.
Aren't you... getting wet?
Hurry up, Sen!
Coming!
I'll leave this open.
On the big tub, Lin?
Lay off me.
Jerks!
They haven't scrubbed this in ages.
This bath is reserved for our filthiest guests.
It's caked with sludge.
Lin, Sen, first customers are here.
Right away...
Shoot, clearly harassment.
This tub needs an herbal soak.
Get a tag from the foreman.
A tag?
An herbal soak tag.
Right.
What's a foreman, Lin?
Something's coming.
I wonder what.
Some useless scum, under cover of rainfall...
I can't waste that on you.
Why good morning!
Feeling refreshed?
For Kasuga sama.
One deluxe sulfur soak.
No point in standing there.
Back to work.
Scrub with your hands.
Good morning!
Your hands, I say.
But...
Um...
It has to be an herbal soak.
You sure are dense.
Oh...
A fragrant bath coming up.
Relax and enjoy...
Hello, foreman here.
Yes, ma'am...
Thank you so much.
That's not...
Hey, you, wait. -What's the trouble?
Why, nothing at all...
We have an intruder.
Is it human?
You figure it out.
Haku's out today.
Wow, you got a really good one.
This goes to Kamaji.
Water'll be right up, it's not too busy now.
Yank on this for hot water.
You're such a klutz.
Look at that color!
That's the dried worm salts.
With water this murky, who's gonna see the sludge?
Yank it again when it's full.
It'll stop.
Go ahead, let go.
I'll get our breakfast.
Sure.
Ouch.
Um...
The bath's not ready yet.
But, there are so many...
Wha...
They're for me?
But...
I don't need this many.
No, just one.
Madam.
It's a Stink Spirit?
An Extra Large Stinker at that.
Headed straight for the bridge!
Please turn back!
Please withdraw!
The bath is closed for the night.
Please withdraw, please.
Peeeee-ewy...
Something's fishy.
Didn't seem like a Stink Spirit, to me...
Well, now that it's here, better go greet it.
Just try to get rid of it, as fast as you can.
Please retire to your rooms!
So terribly sorry.
Please hurry.
Lin and Sen, Yubaba's calling.
Yes sir.
Listen, this is your first job.
You take this customer to the big tub.
Um...
One peep out of you and you're coal.
Got that?
It has arrived.
Don't insult the customer.
Welggum to our bazzs...
Oh...
Money...
Sen, hurry, take it.
Yes ma'am.
Zhow him de bazz.
Pl...
Pleazze.
Sen!
Awful...
Our food...
Open the windows!
All of 'em.
What?
Just a minute.
Truly filthy.
This is no laughing matter.
Let's see what she does.
Ah, she intends to re-fill the tub.
Oh, no, soiling the walls with those filthy hands.
Did you give Sen new tags?
Never, what a waste!
Oh no!
All that precious herbal formula!
Sen!
Sen, where are you?
Lin!
You OK?
I asked Kamaji to give us all the water he's got!
He's sending the best herbal soak ever.
Thank you.
He's got a thorn stuck in him.
A thorn?
It's in so deep, it won't come out.
Thorn!?
She said thorn?
Rally the help downstairs.
Step on it.
Sen and Lin.
That's no Stink Spirit in there.
Grab this rope.
Yes ma'am.
Hold on tight!
Yes ma'am.
Hustle now, and get the women to help them.
I tied it.
Everyone, all of you!
All together now.
Heave!
And heave!
And heave!
And heave!
A bicycle.
As I suspected!
Now, pull!
And heave.
Sen, you OK?
Well done...
Gold!
It's gold!
Hands off!
That's company property!
Be still.
Our guest is still with us.
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Get out and open the door.
Open the main gates!
He's leaving!
Sen!
You did great!
You made us a bundle!
That River Spirit's famous.
You can all learn from Sen.
Sake's on the house, tonight.
Now!
Time to hand over all that gold you picked up.
Want some?
I swiped it.
Thank you.
Man, oh, man.
I didn't see Haku.
Not Haku again.
He just disappears sometimes.
They say Yubaba makes him do bad stuff.
Really...
Lights out, Lin Right.
There's a town.
Looks like the ocean...
What did you expect after all that rain?
Some day, I swear I'll get to that town.
I'm gonna get out of here.
What's wrong?
Gold.
Who are you?
You're no customer.
You're not allowed in there.
Hey!
It's gold, gold!
It's for me.
You can make gold.
Gimme!
Who goes there?
It's way past bedtime.
Hey boss, I'm hungry.
Starving.
That voice...
There, I'll pay you now.
I'm a customer, I want a bath!
Wake everyone up.
Mommy, Daddy, the River Spirit gave me this cake.
I'm sure if you eat it, you'll turn back into people.
Dad, Mom, where are you?
Dad!
Bad dream.
Lin...
Where is everybody?
Wow... it really did turn into an ocean!
I can see where Mom and Dad are from here.
Kamaji's already lit the fires?
Did I sleep that long?
The customer's waiting.
Hurry it up!
Serve everything you've got, even leftovers.
Sen!
Lin!
I was just going to wake you up.
Look.
Real gold!
He gave it to me.
This guest's a real high roller.
Please, sir, try this.
Taste the very best.
Throw us some gold.
Your blessings.
I'm starving, bring it all.
That guest...
Come, Sen, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance!
I'm going to see Kamaji.
I wouldn't go right now.
He's in a foul mood 'cause they woke him up.
Let's go back for more, Lin.
What if I don't recognize my parents?
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.
The dragon I saw before!
It's coming this way.
What are they?
Not birds!
Fight back, Haku!
This way!
Haku?
Haku!
Oh...
It's just paper...
Haku?
That is you, right?
Are you hurt?
Those paper birds are gone.
You're safe, now.
He's going to Yubaba...
Oh, no!
He'll die.
The richest man himself has come To grace us with his presence Welcome.
Time to beg for tips Time to start begging Now beg Please, sir!
Over here.
Gold springs from his palms.
Toss some this way, sir.
What are you doing?
I'm going upstairs.
No, you don't.
What's this?
It's blood!
Move, move.
Let our guest through.
Thank you for helping me before.
Don't just stand there...
I don't want any.
Don't need any.
I'm busy, please excuse me.
Quiet!
Quiet down.
Back, get back.
Please forgive her manners.
After all, the girl is only human and new here...
Wipe that smile off your face.
I saw that look.
Why, I would never...
He ate them!
Yubaba!
We're in a fine mess, now.
Actually, he's a No Face.
That's right, a No Face.
Your greed attracted quite a guest, all right.
Don't do anything stupid until I get down there.
Look, the carpet's a mess.
Get Haku out of here.
He's no use to me now.
Sleeping outside of your crib again.
Oh, I'm sorry, you were sleeping like such a good baby.
Baba still has work to do.
Go back to sleep now.
Good baby.
Ouch, let go!
Oh, thank you for helping me.
But I'm in a hurry.
Please let me go.
You came here to make me sick.
Bad germs outside, bad.
I'm a human.
Maybe you never saw one before.
You'll get sick out there.
Stay here and play with me.
Are you sick?
I'm in here 'cause I'll get sick outside.
It's staying in here that'll make you sick.
You see, somebody I really care about got hurt very badly.
So I've got to go right now.
Please let go of my arm.
If you go, I'll start crying.
If I cry, Baba will come and kill you.
I'll break your little arm.
That hurts!
Please, I'll come play with you later.
No, I wanna play now.
That's blood!
Get it!
It's blood.
Haku!
Stop, go away!
Scat, scat.
Haku!
It is you, right?
Hang on.
Be quiet!
Haku!
Shoo, go away.
Oh, no.
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.
Please be a good boy and wait.
If you don't play with me, I'll cry...
Please, wait.
What a racket!
Simmer down.
You're a little butterball, aren't you...
Guess I'm still a little transparent.
Baba.
Oh, dear, can't you even tell me from your own mother?
There, that gives you a little more freedom.
Let's see now...
What shall we turn you into?
This is our little secret.
You tell anyone, I'll rip your mouth out.
Who are you?
Yubaba's twin sister.
Thanks to you, I've had a good look at this place, enjoyed myself.
Now hand over the dragon.
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt.
That dragon's a thief, my sister's lackey.
Stole a precious seal from my house.
Haku would never!
He's so kind.
All dragons are kind.
Kind and stupid.
Eager to learn my sister's magical ways.
This boy here will do anything that greedy woman wants.
Move away.
It's too late for him anyway.
The seal was protected by a charm...
Any who try to steal it must die.
No, you can't.
What's gotten into them?
Hey there, cut it out!
Go back to your room.
Oh, dear, seems I was careless.
Haku!
Oh, no!
Haku.
What on earth is this?
Hey!
Just wait!
Haku.
Does it hurt?
This is serious.
Haku, don't give up!
Oh, no, he's going to die!
There's something inside him that's killing him.
Inside him?
It's a good spell.
Nothing I can do.
Haku, the River Spirit gave me this.
Eat it, maybe it'll help.
Haku, open your mouth.
Please, Haku, eat it.
See, it's safe.
Is it an herbal cake?
Open.
That's a good boy...
That's it.
Swallow.
He spit it out!
That's it!
The seal!
It got away!
There!
Over there.
Gross, gross, Sen!
Totally gross.
Clean.
Haku took this from Yubaba's sister, Kamaji.
From Zeniba?
A witch's seal.
Precious loot, I'd say.
Oh...
I knew it was Haku!
Look, Kamaji, it's Haku!
Haku!
Kamaji!
He's not breathing!
Yes he is, but he's still very ill from the spell...
That should calm him some.
Haku turned up one day, just like you.
He said he wanted to learn magic.
I didn't approve... of him becoming a sorcerer's apprentice...
I warned him, but he wouldn't listen.
Said he had nowhere left to go.
He signed up to be Yubaba's apprentice.
As time went by, he turned increasingly pale, and his eyes took on a sharp gleam.
Kamaji, I'm going to give this back to Yubaba's sister.
Give it back, apologize, and ask her to help Haku.
Tell me where she lives.
Go to Zeniba's?
She's one scary sorceress.
Please.
Haku helped me.
Now I want to help him.
You can get there all right...
But getting back...
Wait here.
Let's see now...
It's around here, I think...
Everyone, I need my shoes and my clothes, please.
Sen!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Lin.
That's Haku.
What happened here?
Who are these guys?
My new friends.
Yubaba's tearing the place apart looking for you.
The big tipper turned out to be a horrible monster, No Face.
Yubaba says you led him here.
Maybe I did.
You serious?
I just thought he was a customer...
He's already swallowed three of our people.
Found it!
Here it is, Sen.
We're busy, gramps.
You can use this.
TRAIN TICKETS Train tickets.
Where'd you get them?
I've had them for 40 years.
Now listen, it's the sixth stop, called Swamp Bottom.
Swamp Bottom.
That's right, it's the sixth stop.
The sixth stop.
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train, but these days it's a one-way ride.
Still interested.
Yup.
I'll walk back, along the tracks.
But what about Yubaba?
I'll go to her now.
I promise I'll be back, Haku.
You can't die.
What's going on here?
Don't you see?
It's called... love...
It just keeps getting bigger.
Don't let it swallow me.
Here she comes.
Thank goodness, Sen.
Yubaba can't control him.
There's no need to get upset.
I'm sure Sen will turn up.
Where's Sen!
I want Sen.
Go, hurry.
Yubaba, it's Sen.
Where were you?
Sen has come, dear guest.
We'll be right with you.
What took you so long!
This is a complete disaster.
Suck up to him and squeeze all his gold out of him.
What's that filthy rat?
Don't you recognize him?
Of course not, how disgusting.
Now, in you go.
Call if you need us.
Is she all right in there by herself?
Want to take her place?
Try this, it's yummy.
Want some gold?
I'm not giving it to anybody else.
Come over here, Sen.
What is it you want?
You can tell me.
Where did you come from?
There's someplace I have to go right away.
You should go back where you came from.
You can't help me with what I want.
Where's your home?
Don't you have a mom and dad?
I don't wanna...
I'm lonely...
Can't you get back home?
I want Sen.
Take the gold.
Are you going to eat me?
Take it.
Take it.
If you're going to eat me, have this first.
I was saving it for my parents, but you can have it.
Sen.
Girl!
What did you feed me?
Out of my way!
Not on my premises!
Over here!
Here!
You'll pay for this.
Sen, over here!
There he is.
Over here!
Don't call him over.
He's only bad in the bath house.
He needs to get out of there.
But take him where?
I don't know...
You don't know...
He's following us.
From here, you walk.
You'll find the station.
Thank you.
You better come back.
I know I called you a klutz!
I take it back!
No Face, if you so much as touch that girl, you'll pay for it.
There it is.
Train's coming, here we go.
I'm riding to Swamp Bottom.
You want to come, too?
Him too, please.
Come here.
Behave yourself, OK?
Kamaji.
Oh, Haku...
You're awake.
Where's Sen?
What happened?
Please tell me.
Don't you remember anything?
Just little pieces.
Chihiro kept calling my name in the darkness.
I followed her voice and woke up lying here...
Chihiro, huh...
Her real name's Chihiro.
Can't beat the power of love...
This gold hardly covers the damage.
That fool, Sen.
She just cost me a fortune.
But, Sen did save us, after all.
Silence!
She started it all, and now she's run away.
Even abandoned her own parents!
They must be fine fat pigs by now.
Turn them into bacon or ham.
Please wait.
Master Haku.
What, you still alive?
You still can't see that you've lost something precious.
Don't get fresh with me.
Since when do you talk that way?
Baby...
Baby!
It's just sand.
Baby!
Where are you, baby?
Come out, please.
You!
Tell me!
Where did you hide my baby?
He's with Zeniba.
Zeniba?
I get it, that evil witch.
So she thinks she's beaten me.
So, what's your plan?
I'll bring baby back.
But in exchange, return Sen and her parents to the human world.
And what becomes of you?
Let's say I tear you to pieces after sending them back!
I think this is the right stop...
Let's go.
You can ride on my shoulder.
Come in.
Excuse us.
Well, hurry up and come in, then.
C'mon.
So you all made it.
Um...
Have a seat.
I'll make you some tea.
Zeniba, Haku stole this from you.
I brought it back.
Do you know what this is?
No, but I know it's very precious.
I'm here to apologize for Haku.
I'm sorry.
You felt fine while you held it?
What?
What's this?
The spell is gone.
I'm sorry.
I stepped on that strange bug that was on the seal and squashed it.
Squashed it?
You know, my sister snuck that bug into the dragon, so she could control her apprentice.
Squashed it...
You sit too.
You're No Face, aren't you?
You sit, too.
Oh, um, please turn them back into themselves.
Why my dears, the spell's long broken.
You can turn yourselves back.
My sister and I are two halves of a whole, but we really don't get along.
You've seen what bad taste she has.
Sorceress twins are just a recipe for trouble.
I'd like to help you, dear, but there's nothing I can do.
It's one of our rules here.
You've got to take care of your parents and that dragon boyfriend of yours, on your own.
But, um, can't you even give me a hint?
I feel like Haku and I met a long time ago.
In that case, it's easy.
Nothing that happens, is ever forgotten, even if you can't remember it.
It's already late.
Why don't you stay the night?
You boys give me a hand.
Keep at it.
That's right, you're terrific.
You're a big help...
A magic one won't do the trick.
Pull it through there...
And do it again.
I really have to go home, Granny.
Haku could die while I'm just sitting here...
They might eat my mom and dad.
Just wait a little longer.
There we are.
Use it to tie back your hair.
It's so pretty.
It'll protect you.
I made it from the thread they spun.
Thank you.
What good timing.
We've got another guest, let him in.
Sure.
Haku!
Thank goodness.
Aren't you hurt?
You sure you're OK?
Thank goodness.
Good timing, I'd say.
Look, Granny, Haku's alive.
Haku, I no longer blame you for what you did.
Just be sure you protect the girl.
OK, boys, time to go home.
Come back soon.
You, stick around and be my helper.
Granny!
Thank you, I'm going now.
I'm sure you can manage everything.
My real name is Chihiro.
Chihiro...
What a nice name.
Take good care of it, it's yours.
I will!
Off you go.
Yes.
Thank you, granny.
Good bye.
Listen, Haku.
I don't remember it, but my mom told me...
Once, when I was little, I fell into a river.
She said they'd drained it and built things on top.
But I've just remembered.
The river was called...
Its name was the Kohaku River.
Your real name is Kohaku.
Chihiro, thank you.
My real name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.
Nigihayami?
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.
What a name!
Sounds like a guardian spirit.
I also remember how you fell into me as a child.
You were chasing your shoe.
Yes, you carried me to shallow water, Kohaku.
I'm so grateful...
They're back!
You brought Baby back with you, right?
Baba.
You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had.
Baby, you're standing all by yourself?
When...
Yubaba, you promised.
Please return Chihiro's family to the human world.
Not so fast.
This world has rules, you know.
Shut up!
Baba, don't be so mean.
Just do it.
Baby had such a good time.
But, a rule's a rule.
Otherwise I can't break the spell.
If you make Sen cry, I won't like you anymore, Baba.
Why that's-- Granny.
Granny?
I'm coming to you.
Haku told me all about the rule.
At least you've got guts.
Here's your contract.
Come over here.
I won't be a minute, Baby.
Don't worry.
See if you can guess which of them are yours.
You only get one guess.
Get it right, and you're all free.
Granny, this is no good.
My parents aren't here.
Not here?
That's your answer?
Yes.
Bingo!
Thatta girl!
Right on!
Thank you, everyone.
Go!
You win.
Just get out of here.
Thank you for everything.
Good bye.
Thank you.
Come and see us.
Haku...
Let's go.
Where are Mom and Dad?
They've gone on ahead.
There's no water.
I can't go any farther.
Go back the way you came, Chihiro.
But don't ever look back.
Not until you're out of the tunnel.
What about you, Haku?
I'll speak to Yubaba.
Quit my apprenticeship.
I'm fine, now that I have my name back.
I'll go back to my world, too.
Can we meet again?
I'm sure.
Promise?
Promise.
Now go, and don't look back.
Chihiro.
Where have you been?
Hurry up.
Mom!
Dad!
You can't just run off like that.
Away we go.
Mom, are you sure you're OK?
What?
I'm sure the moving van's there by now.
Hurry along, Chihiro.
Watch your step.
You'll make me trip, Chihiro, clinging like that.
The end of the tunnel.
Hey...
What is it?
Will you look at that...
It's all dusty inside, too.
Some kind of joke?
You think?
I told you not to stop here.
OK, all clear.
We're off, Chihiro.
Hurry up, Chihiro.
THE END
Yeah? -Porco Rosso!
The Mamma Aiutos are on the move!
The Mamma Aiutos?
I don't work cheap, you know.
They're after a boat out of Venice carrying a mine payroll.
Is that all?
No.
There's a girls school tour aboard.
That'll cost you. -We'll pay Section 14-3 rates.
And 14-4, too.
Heave to!
Heave to or we sink you!
Wow!
Pirates!
Not just pirates!
Air pirates!
Time for an overhaul.
Are you bad guys?
Yep.
So we're hostages?
Yep.
Are you air pirates?
What a smart little girl!
A skull!
And very well-drawn!
Come on!
We're in a hurry!
There's 15.
Do we take them all?
It's not nice to break up the group!
Too late!
They took the girls and the money!
Bring them back for us!
They went that way!
No!
They didn't go that way!
I know what those cheapskates are up to.
They'll change course for the nearest island as soon as they're out of sight.
They can't afford to waste gas.
Oops.
Come on!
I don't have much time.
Gotcha!
Just a tour plane going round the islands.
Hey, it's a pig!
A Pig!
Hey, piggy!
He's so cute!
Look over here!
Hang around here and the pirates'll get you!
Cool!
Will you all shut up?
We're flying!
Let me see!
Hey!
Cut that out!
Quiet!
Be quiet, will you?
Do something!
You're the one who said to bring them all!
Just for a second.
I'm not supposed to let you do this.
It's so beautiful!
Look!
A red plane!
Where?
Where?
Did you see it?
Yeah.
That's as far as you go!
Here it comes!
It's Porco Rosso!
I can't see!
Oh, no!
It stopped!
We'll crash!
We've got another engine!
What are you doing?
Fire!
Fire!
That red plane's tough!
You missed!
Move!
A message from the pig. "You're beat.
Do as I say." Shut up!
He's coming!
Get down!
Where did he go?
He's hiding!
We crashed!
We're going to sink!
No, we won't!
This is a seaplane!
We're sinking!
Hey!
Stop that!
Halt!
You're hostages!
Don't worry.
We're all on the swim team.
That's not what I mean!
Another message! "You can have half the money.
Give me the rest and the kids." Or I'll kill all Of you. ...is what he says.
Half the money!
Shut up!
Come on, you swine!
It's you and me!
Take that!
It's busted!
We surrender!
We surrender!
Don't kill us!
Bye-bye!
Goodbye!
He left us enough for repairs.
Don't be such a sap!
Be quiet, will you?
Don't pull on that!
You'll break it!
Stay away from the propeller!
You've got to pee?
Just do it there.
Another triumph for Porco Rosso So the Mamma Aiutos can't come tonight.
And that filthy pig bounty hunter is a hero!
But this young kid's an American, isn't he?
The air pirates of the Adriatic can't ask an American for help!
His grandmother was a quarter Italian.
Anyway, we've got to do something about Porco!
But 10% is outrageous!
Beautiful!
He's here.
With his snout in the air, as always!
Mr.
Porco Rosso?
I'm from The Neptune.
Well done, sir!
I guess we won't see the Mamma Aiutos for a while.
I hear that bounties might be a little bit higher this year.
Hey, you!
Put me down!
Listen quietly to the music.
She's quite a woman.
Even American pilots know Madame Gina at the Hotel Adriano.
Air pirates and bounty hunters alike leave their quarrels outside.
So that's the famous Curtiss parked outside?
The Rattlesnake.
Bringer of fame and fortune.
You beat Italians two years running for the Schneider Trophy.
It's not just fast.
It's good in a dogfight, too.
But I hear tell of a "Porco Rosso" who's pretty famous, too.
Be careful working with the pirates, kid.
They're poor, they're cheap, and they're smelly because they don't bathe.
That's true.
Who are you calling dirty, pig?
Quite a distinguished gathering!
You boys must be planning something.
Correct.
Always glad to see you, but no war games here, okay?
We know, Gina.
We don't work within 50 kilometers of here.
We're even polite to the pig!
That's my boys.
Be seeing you.
Wow!
You're on fire!
Tell me what happened!
Next time we're alone.
That American's funny.
He took one look and said, "Marry me!" So I told him, "I've married three pilots. "One died in the war, one in the Atlantic, and the third in Asia." They found him?
I got a call today.
They found his remains in Bengal.
It's been three years.
I've got no more tears left.
The good ones all get killed.
To comrades.
Thanks, Marco.
You're always here for me.
You're the only one left from the old days.
One thing I don't like about this place.
That picture.
Don't touch it.
It's the only one of you when you were human.
The spell that changed you, how can we break it?
That American jerk is a good pilot.
Must be nice to make that much money.
This month's payment.
That pays off the loan on your plane.
How about making a contribution to the people with a Patriot Bond?
I'm not a person.
Hello, Porco Rosso!
It's done!
Give me 60 bullets.
It's pretty crowded outside.
Yeah?
Maybe the government's going to change again.
They'll pass a law against you guys.
Laws don't apply to Digs- That's for sure.
Or moles like me.
Just regular bullets?
Not high-explosives or armor-piercing?
Listen, kid, we're not fighting a war out there.
See you.
Thank you!
Hey, boss, how is war different from bounty hunting?
War profiteers are villains.
Penniless bounty hunters are just stupid.
We're air pirates!
We don't take out bank loans!
What else can we do?
These repairs were expensive!
Federation planes!
Why do we have to fly with a bunch of losers like this?
It's all the pig's fault!
Can't those Mamma Aiutos even afford paint?
That is shabby!
It looks like everyone's here.
Hey, is the American here yet?
He's up in the sun!
Right where he should be! "Sighted target.
The Mediterranean Queen." We're taking a ship that big?
That's why we all got together! "Having engine trouble.
Go first.
We will cover you." "That's a dirty trick!
We follow the plan!" "Then we share repair costs!" "You gutless wonder!
We pay our own repairs, just like always!" "Do you want to be bombed?" "Engine trouble!
Engine trouble!" "We settled all this before!" "What a miser!" "Split the cost or I'm out." All of you, shut up!
Attention all passengers.
We are under attack by air pirates.
There is no need for alarm.
We carry two advanced fighter aircraft.
We will now introduce our pilots.
Number one.
The Black Stallion, Signor Valleta!
Number two.
The Wolf of the Tiber, Flying Officer Visconti!
They've got muscle!
That wasn't in the deal!
What a mess!
Get away from me!
Curtiss!
Right!
Let's go!
That's not good.
Guess I have to go to Milan. ...both pilots were shot down, but parachuted to safety.
The Pirate Federation looted the vessel and left this message.
You're next!
Come and get us, pig!
We repeat. "You're next.
Come and get us, pig!" Way to go, you turkeys!
Sorry.
I'm on vacation.
White sheets, beautiful women.
Just get me to Milan, engine.
I don't like that weather.
I'll just have to go below the clouds.
Come on!
You can do it!
That's right, engine!
Good boy!
Pig!
It's one against one!
Not right now!
I'll tell everyone you ran and hid!
Catch you later, Yank!
Oh, damn!
I'm in the open.
Gotcha!
No, you didn't!
My engine quit!
Yes!
Now I'll be famous, too!
I can't go back empty-handed, though.
They won't believe me without proof.
There!
That stupid red color.
No mistake!
A souvenir for my mama in Alabama!
Hurry, please.
Madame!
Madame Gina!
There's a phone call.
He's safe.
He's alive.
Use the phone at the front desk.
Marco?
Are you all right?
I was just leaving to look for you.
Good!
I've lost weight.
Two nights on a deserted island.
I'm taking the plane to Milan to get it fixed.
If that American comes in, tell him I'll be seeing him again.
Hey!
I'm not a messenger!
I worry about you, and you treat me like part of the furniture!
Someday you're going to be a pork roast.
I don't want to go to your funeral.
A pig's gotta fly.
Idiot!
Is Porco Rosso dead or alive?
I figured you'd be in tonight.
I'm back.
Messed it up again, huh?
Why not just get a new plane?
No, I like this one.
I know how you feel.
Look out.
I'll back her in.
Who's the little cutie?
My granddaughter, back from the States.
Keep coming, keep coming.
What a beautiful plane, Grandpa!
It's got great lines!
There's no one now who can do work like that.
No resemblance.
She's really your granddaughter?
Hands off.
Fio, lock up.
Okay.
My opponent is Curtiss.
I need another 15 knots.
Curtiss?
I haven't heard that name for a while.
Well?
Where did you get a Folgore?
Don't ask.
The Italian that Curtiss beat in 1927 for the Schneider Trophy had this engine.
But it wasn't the engine's fault.
The mechanic was a fool.
This is exciting!
Don't fine-tune it too much.
It's not a race.
Tell me about it!
You're explaining Buddhism to Buddha.
Are you going to take all I have?
These days money's not worth the paper it's printed on.
Empty your pockets.
That's for the propeller, the paint...
That's for my hotel and my meals!
Stay here.
I'll give you room and board cheap.
Where are your sons?
Are they good?
They're all away working.
So who'll do the design?
Fio.
Fio?
That little girl?
She's young, but she's got something my sons don't.
We've been together a long time, but I think I'll try somewhere else.
Wait!
Are you worried because I'm a girl?
Or because I'm young?
Both, miss.
I can understand that.
Tell me, what's the main thing that goes to make a good pilot?
Experience?
No.
Inspiration.
I'm glad you didn't say experience.
Grandpa says you were very young when you first soloed and that you were good even then.
It was in 1910 when I was 17.
Seventeen?
I'm 17 now!
Let me try.
I can't help being a girl, but we've got the old drawings.
If it's no good, you don't have to pay.
Okay, Grandpa?
She's kin.
She'll do fine.
I took apart my first engine when I was 12.
Sleep on this.
We'll fix you a bed tomorrow.
Breakfast's at 7:00.
Good night.
You're still short, but we're old friends.
Pay the rest later.
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Did you work all night?
This is just rough.
We'll leave this part as it is, but use a different wing section.
That should give us five knots.
The old drawings were a surprise.
The wings were single-structure.
The old drawings were a surprise.
Whoever did this really understood wood.
I'm impressed.
They only made one of these.
It was too dangerous to fly.
I found it in a warehouse.
I thought so.
The way the wings are set, I'm surprised it even takes off.
Landings and take-offs are tricky.
They're better at high speed.
Tilt the wings back half a degree for me.
Leave the rest the same.
So you'll let me do it?
Thank you!
You won't be sorry.
But there's one condition, miss.
Don't work all night.
You don't do good work on no sleep.
It's bad for your looks, too.
All right.
Actually, I was so nervous last night I couldn't sleep.
To tell you the truth, I was afraid you wouldn't let me do it.
I'm so happy!
I'll make some coffee.
I sure hope she's not going to build it alone, too.
My niece Monica will do the drawings, my great-nephew's wife the finishing.
My cousin's daughters.
Sophia, Laura, Constance and Valentina.
Fio's sister Giliola.
Sandra's her cousin.
Marietta, you've gotten so pretty!
My sons' wives Maria, Tina, Anna, and her sister Miletta.
Porcelino!
Grandma!
The angels haven't come for you yet?
You've grown up into a fine man!
You all work here, too?
To buy things for our great-grandchildren!
There's not one man here!
They're all family?
Yeah.
There's no work here.
The men are all gone away.
The depression...
Don't worry.
The women are tough and they work hard.
It's not pancakes we're making here.
Our Lord who art in heaven.
We thank thee for giving our struggling company work and bread.
Forgive my sin of using women's hands to build a warplane.
Amen.
Let's eat up and get to work!
That sounds good!
This engine was a good choice.
How do you like them RPMs?
Watch out or you'll blow the shed away!
Curtiss doesn't stand a chance.
Yeah, it's a good idea.
So can I do it?
Well, this is going to cost a lot more money.
Look how far we are over budget already, and our customer...
Porco...
Don't look at me like that!
Do whatever you like.
Great!
I'll tell the workshop and we'll get to work!
Porco, I love you!
I can wait three months.
Maybe I'll become a pirate.
She's a good kid, huh?
Hands off.
That's the furthest thing from my mind.
So you're a Squadron Leader now?
What did you come back for?
I go where I want.
The authorities won't like it.
Are you being tailed?
I shook them off.
There are warrants out on you for treason, illegal entry, decadence, pornography and being a lazy pig.
It's not funny!
They want to seize your plane, too.
This is a lousy film.
Come back to the Air Force, Marco.
I could still get you in.
Better a pig than a fascist.
Freelance daredevils are finished.
To fly now you need a government or an airline to pay you.
I only fly on what I earn myself.
Wherever you fly, you're still a pig.
Thanks, Ferrarin.
Say hello to the guys.
This is a good film.
Be careful.
They won't bother with a court of law.
See you, buddy.
Want a ride?
Thanks a lot.
I borrowed this to take the plane to the lake for tests tomorrow.
No time for that.
I've got to fly.
Don't be stupid!
I'm not delivering an untested plane!
It takes a whole day to take it apart and get it to the lake.
There's no time.
Take a careful look out the back window.
The Fascist Secret Police.
They followed you.
Me?
Why? 'Cause I shook them off.
And you're fixing my plane.
Hey, are you really a spy?
Me a spy?
Spies are a lot more serious than me.
But you were a war hero.
Why follow you if you've done nothing?
I agree!
Wrong way.
I guess you did do something.
Time to get busy.
It's ready to fly.
There's two men out back and three out front.
This is so exciting!
Settle down, Grandma!
I'll see you.
Take care.
What are you doing?
Making myself a place.
Give me five minutes.
What are you talking about?
Don't be stupid!
Don't shout!
Listen, Fio.
You're a respectable woman.
Plus you're not married!
Hold this.
Thanks.
I had to rush to make this.
A perfect fit!
Hold that, will you?
Look, I'm a bounty hunter.
I don't run tourist flights!
I want to get my first job right.
I can make adjustments as we go.
I'm taking off from the canal.
I might not even get airborne!
All the more reason to take me.
You'll need a mechanic against Curtiss.
I'm a male, and we'll be all alone on a deserted island.
Great!
I love camping out.
That's not the point!
Take her along!
If you don't beat Curtiss, we don't get paid.
If you don't pay, we go broke.
You're her grandfather!
I'll give you a break on her salary, and I'll throw in this voice tube.
There'll be a price on her head, too.
No.
I'll be your hostage.
We'll tell the police you forced us to help you.
That'll be our excuse.
So please, take me with you.
I'll make myself useful.
Take out the right machine gun.
I don't care how small your bottom is, it won't fit between them.
Great!
My hips are bigger than they look.
Wait a minute.
We'll leave now, before Grandma wants to come, too.
Hey, that's an idea!
Grandma, quick!
Please don't buy me anything!
Contact!
Open up!
Let go!
Kidnapper!
Pay us our money!
How's the rudder, Porco?
Very rough!
Like you!
Harder to handle than ever!
Stop and I'll fix it.
No time!
I've got to get her up!
This water's like glue!
Ship ahoy!
Here we go!
Come on, baby!
The flaps are in the water!
Use your tabs!
Tabs?
They're new!
Quick!
That's right!
Now you're behaving!
Beautiful.
The world is so beautiful.
Are they after us?
He's not attacking.
But that's an Air Force plane.
Ferrarin, I bet.
You know him?
The Air Force is waiting for us.
He'll show us a way through.
He says to go low and out to sea.
Thanks, buddy!
Thank you!
He saw you and told me, "Pearls before swine." Beautiful!
A single rose blooming in a secret garden.
Very rude.
This is a private garden.
I just had to show this to you.
From Hollywood? "In the matter of your starring in the script you have sent..." "Serious consideration" and "please reply ASAP." I call it Flowers of the Adriatic.
Nice name.
You like it?
Then it's settled.
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.
Being a hired gun for air pirates is a mere step to fame and fortune.
The next step is Hollywood star.
And then?
President!
I'm serious!
I'll make you the First Lady, Gina!
Gina!
You're stupid.
I like that in a man.
Really?
But I can't.
I'm gambling right now that someone will visit me here, and I'll tell him I love him.
But the fool only comes to the club, at night.
He never comes out in daylight.
That jerk's come back!
Idiot!
He just kept on going.
I lost my bet.
You mean you're betting on that jerk?
Can't I?
Life here is more complicated than where you're from.
You can fall in love again and again, but...
You go to Hollywood alone, kid. "Kid"?
I bumped my head when you did that roll!
Just saying hello to a friend.
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?
The woman in white on the terrace?
Grandpa told me.
All the pilots in the Adriatic are in love with her.
He's got a big mouth!
What's she like?
Are you in love with her, too?
I'm putting down.
Shut up or you'll bite your tongue.
Hey, wait!
A girl riding a fighter plane!
Where's Porco?
Talking to my dad about something.
It's not just the caretaker government.
It's the royalists, too.
They want to link up with the Pirates' Federation.
There's no money in chasing pirates anymore.
There.
Thanks.
All this talk about a depression!
You ought to sell your services somewhere, too.
A good pilot can make good money.
Got any smokes?
Curtiss'll go back to the States soon.
We're the ones who should go to America. "Farewell to the days of fun and freedom in the Adriatic." Is that Byron?
No, me.
See you.
Porco, it's terrible!
Their fuel's three times what it is back in Italy!
Give us a break!
We don't water our fuel here!
Man, girls are stupid!
Talk to her, will you?
Pay him, Fio.
Then stuff that bigger-than-it-looks backside in with the machine gun.
Off to the hideout!
I'm putting the fuel on your bill!
They're fair.
We help each other when we need it.
It's pretty around here, but no one's got much money.
There's the island.
It's beautiful!
What a great hideout!
My leg's gone to sleep.
Look at all you silly idiots.
Hey, boss!
We got him!
Watch who you're stepping on!
Move!
We've been waiting, pig.
We knew you were coming.
We've got a score to settle.
He's got a girl with him!
She's pretty!
Shut up!
So what?
Half the world is women!
That's not just any girl!
She's Piccolo's chief design engineer.
A cute little thing like her?
Are you sure?
My plane's a lot better than it was.
She's young but she's good.
Really, Porco?
I never lie about planes.
Be nice to her.
She's here to make sure I pay the bill.
You're in debt, too?
Serves you right!
Bust that plane up so bad all he's got left is the loan on it!
You're going to take an ax to the plane I built?
A plane as beautiful as that?
It's a long story, miss.
So you are!
Well, you know...
And you call yourselves pilots?
Move!
Where are my shoes?
I was raised on stories about seaplane pilots.
My grandpa always said there's no finer people.
Their hearts are washed clean by both sea and sky.
So they're braver than sailors and prouder than regular pilots.
That's right.
That's a seaplane pilot!
The most precious thing to them isn't money or women, it's honor.
Yeah!
That's right.
Good point, miss!
Hurray for seaplane pilots!
Oh, brother!
All right.
We won't take our axes and bust up the plane you built.
But honor won't let us just walk away, either!
Mince the pig!
Yeah!
Make hamburger out of him!
Don't be so pig-headed!
You don't understand!
Haven't you any shame?
You need an American to come and save you?
Your mothers would weep!
And tell you to take a bath!
Porco's come back to go one-on-one with Curtiss for the honor of the seaplane pilots of the Adriatic!
A man without honor or scruples is nothing!
Fight fair!
I always said we shouldn't hire Curtiss.
Stop trying to weasel out of things!
What do we do, boss?
She makes sense.
We could lose face here.
Should we talk to Curtiss again?
Get him to fight again?
The contract's expired.
This is embarrassing!
It's Curtiss!
I heard you!
I don't run, and I don't hide!
What idiot put a path up there?
Hold this for me.
So you want a return match?
But I already won once.
I'm no one's hired gun anymore.
So what do you want?
Beautiful!
Will you marry me if I win?
I'm serious.
All right.
But if Porco wins, you pay his bills.
Wait, Fio!
You keep out of it!
Speak now or hold your peace, miss.
It's up to him.
This is expensive!
It's cheap!
Yes or no?
I'll gladly fight for the woman I love!
Right!
Listen, all of you!
I like this girl's spunk!
The Mamma Aiutos will promote this fight!
Along with the Pirates' Federation!
See you later, Miss Fio!
You morons!
Don't forget to show up, pig!
Shut up and get out of here!
See you!
Look what you've gone and gotten me into!
Don't be angry.
I know it was stupid.
Fio, I've got to thank you, anyway.
You got me a chance.
Thanks.
I guess fate meant for us to be a team.
So we're partners?
My chances are only 50-50.
I believe in you. "Believe." I hate that word, but it sounds different coming from you.
What's the matter?
You're not feeling well?
Fio?
I'm fine.
My heart started beating so fast I couldn't breathe.
I was really scared.
My knees are all wobbly.
Hey!
I'm going swimming!
Porco, we screwed up!
How?
We should have padded the bill!
We blew it!
You're right!
Porco...
What?
Can't you sleep?
I could've sworn...
Or was I dreaming?
Go back to sleep.
Tomorrow's an early day.
Porco, why did you turn into a pig?
Well, you know...
My father was in the same unit as a Flight-Lieutenant Marco Paggot.
I used to love the story of how he jumped off a cliff in a storm to rescue an enemy pilot.
Porco, shall I kiss you?
You know how the princess turned the frog back into a prince.
Don't be stupid.
Save your kisses for when you need them.
Maybe I'm not the one.
You're a good girl.
You make me think that all humanity's not a waste.
Now be a good girl and go to sleep.
Tell me a story, and I will.
A story?
Let me see.
It was the last summer of the war.
We were on our usual patrol over the Adriatic, heading for Istria.
Berlini was beside me.
An old friend, who'd gotten married two days before.
I was best man at his wedding.
But we couldn't get leave, so we'd come straight back to base.
Planes were going down like flies, ours and theirs.
I had three on my tail.
I didn't have time for anyone else.
Then mine was the only one of our planes left.
The enemy kept coming.
I was running away like crazy.
My hands and feet were numb, I couldn't see.
I thought I was dead.
Suddenly everything all went white in front of me.
White?
Yeah, like I was in pure light.
But a light so strange it took a while to realize I was in cloud.
I was so tired I didn't have enough strength to fly.
But the plane just kept flying by itself.
A cloud prairie?
Yeah, and dead quiet.
The sky was so beautiful.
With that weird line of clouds stretching up out of sight.
Berlini!
You're okay?
Berlini!
Wait!
Where are you going?
Berlini!
Stop!
What about Gina?
I'll go instead!
When I came to, I was flying all alone right down on the water.
God was telling you, "Not yet." I felt like he was telling me just to keep on flying alone forever.
No, Porco!
You're good!
The good ones are the dead ones.
It might have been hell I saw.
End of story.
Go to sleep.
That junkyard sold me rusty bullets!
I'm glad you came back alive.
I like you.
Good night!
Place your bets here!
If you're real men, put your money where your mouths are!
You'd think it was a carnival!
They're all air pirates?
The scum of the Mediterranean.
Gangsters, pirates, smugglers, spies, plain-clothes cops, a few respectable citizens.
This is going to make me even more famous!
Ten minutes to start!
The showdown between Porco Rosso and Donald Curtiss is about to begin!
There's no rules.
The first one to run is a coward forever!
Shut up!
We came here for a dogfight, not speeches!
Shut up!
Open your mouth and we shoot you!
A 10-ton bomb would be better.
This fight decides the fate of our beloved Miss Fio Piccolo who needs no introduction!
Know what I mean?
A big hand for Fio!
Applaud!
Let's get this over with!
Quiet!
There are formalities to observe!
Both sides will place their wagers!
Miss.
Thank you.
Put it down!
No complaints?
All right, shake hands and come out flying!
Forget it.
I'm a hygienic pig.
That's not very friendly.
We'll go straight to the church!
Don't worry.
My mother says you can get used to anything.
May we have a picture?
We all took a bath!
Smile, everyone!
Smile!
Black wins if it's over in three minutes!
Maybe we could get them to do this every month!
Five seconds to start.
That is so cool!
Five seconds, four, three, two, one, zero!
Curtiss has the height!
It's all Curtiss so far!
Give me!
Come on, Porco!
Get above him!
He's a better target up high.
He's harder to hit on the deck.
Don't worry!
I've got lots of bullets!
A barrel roll!
The pig's on his tail!
A barrel roll?
That trick made him the Ace of the Adriatic!
Curses!
Now!
He didn't shoot!
Are his guns jammed?
He's not going to shoot until the very last.
The pig's not a killer.
The American's still got plenty of ammo!
Now!
Shoot!
He didn't!
What did I tell you?
If he shoots now, he'll hit the American.
He's going to wait till he can put two or three shots into the engine.
The damn fool thinks this isn't war!
Porco!
What's wrong with you?
Shoot!
Or are your guns jammed?
Too bad!
They're coming this way!
Come on!
Fight like a pig!
Not this way!
No!
He ditched the pig!
Go fight somewhere else!
Look at those vapor trails!
This you only see once in a lifetime!
This is so moving!
If she doesn't hurry, she'll miss it!
She won't come out of her room.
Are we going or not?
I want to see it!
F to Gina of my heart, warn pig to stop fooling around.
The Air Force is coming. "F"?
That's Ferrarin.
Time to go!
They're both really tough!
They're just getting warmed up!
Go, Porco!
You stupid Pig!
You think you're going to have Fio?
Now the pig's got his tail!
The finale!
It's jammed!
The finish!
What the...
Jammed!
What an idiot.
You're out of ammo!
It's bent!
Fio's big butt!
There aren't any ties in this game!
This isn't a cowboy film!
What are you going to hit with that?
You jerk!
What good's that going to do?
Hi-ho, Silver!
You rotten pig!
Missed me!
Chicken!
You ducked!
This is for love?
Shut up, pig!
Something's wrong.
They're coming down!
They're back!
Wait!
The prizes stay here!
Useless!
Guys, come back!
You gluttonous pig!
Cowboy!
Put 'em up!
Go punch a cow!
Come on, Porco!
Get up, Pig!
That's dirty!
Uppercut!
Block!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
The Federation can set up as bookmakers!
Bring a bell!
Can't you go faster?
No.
The engine'll burn up.
Pilots are all crazy!
Fio!
Did you see that punch?
I'll finish you in the next round!
Next round you go to sleep!
Stay in there!
You're going to be brain-dead!
Come on, Don Juan!
You're the Don Juan here!
Chasing every girl you see!
What about you?
Who's it going to be, Fio or Gina?
What?
Stop hogging them!
Gina. "Miss Gina" to you!
Gina's in love with you!
She sits in that garden and waits for you to come!
Porco!
The bell!
Start the count!
Look at him!
The Air Force isn't here yet.
Try to psyche me out, will you?
I don't get you!
It's the truth!
You won't get Fio!
That's Gina!
There's trouble!
First one to stand wins!
Coming through!
No, Gina!
Marco!
Can you hear me?
Are you going to make another woman unhappy?
Porco!
Porco!
Thank you, Porco!
It was nothing.
Okay, the party's over.
The Italian Air Force is coming.
Get out of here, everyone.
Come to the club.
Drinks are on the house!
We're out of here!
It's over.
Boss!
Hurry!
There are formalities to observe!
I hate the pig, but I like you.
Build some good planes.
Bye!
Thanks.
Take a bath sometime!
Thanks, Mr.
Curtiss!
Next time it won't be a bet.
I'll court you for real.
Sure.
But I've made up my mind.
You ride in Gina's plane.
No!
I ride in your plane!
We're partners, aren't we?
Gina, take this girl back to the regular world.
You always do this.
It's not fair.
Sorry.
Away you go.
Take her up.
Here comes the Air Force.
Help me lead them away.
Hey!
Your face!
Wait!
Show me your face!
Your plane's over there!
Just one look!
Porco never showed up again, even after the Air Force did its sweep and I went back to Milan.
But Gina and I became good friends.
And we still are, through all the war and turmoil there's been since then.
Now I run Piccolo Co., but I still spend every summer at the Hotel Adriano.
Gina is more beautiful every year, and there are lots of old faces.
Yes.
Mr.
Curtiss still isn't President, but he writes us saying he misses the good old days of that Adriatic summer.
Whether Gina ever won her bet or not is our secret.
The End
Wait!
You're it!
In this world, there's an invisible magic circle.
You're it!
What are you doing?
So you did date him!
What?
There's an inside and an outside.
Capture the movement.
It's hard.
Right?
Let's see.
Hey, not yet!
These people are inside the circle.
And I'm outside.
But I don't really care.
How's it coming?
Um, I... kind of messed up.
Let me have a look.
Oh, no.
Are you okay?
Hey, hey...
I...
I hate myself.
Anna...
You're fine now.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Thank you, Doctor.
Anna, do you feel all right now?
I'm fine.
You looked like you were in agony.
Where was your inhaler?
I cost you money again.
Why do you say that?
Oh, Miyoko.
I brought Anna's bag.
Her notebook is inside.
Why, thank you.
We were just nearby.
If there's anything else...
Wait...
Has Anna been getting along with you?
She tells me nothing about school.
She's okay.
But she's very quiet.
Quiet?
More like...
Hey, don't.
We're just a bit loud.
Well, take care.
Ever the worrywart, your mother.
Mother...
She's probably a loner at school.
It's true that stress can trigger asthma attacks.
Meanwhile, my husband's off on a business trip.
Maybe he and I are partly to blame, too. 12 years old...
It's a difficult age.
Have you noticed anything about her?
She... always has a straight face.
A straight face?
I'm sorry.
Like she won't show her emotions...
She used to be more expressive.
But these days, I don't even know...
Maybe it's because we're not related by blood.
You may want to send her somewhere to get better. 7:03 DEPARTURE FOR KUSHIRO Say, Anna...
Do you remember Uncle and Aunt Oiwa?
The air is very clean where they live.
It'll help your condition to spend some time there.
I can't go with you, but they'll take care of you.
Be a good girl, eat well, and come back nice and happy.
She whines like a goat.
Oh, here she is.
Anna.
Remember us?
No, but Auntie told me all about you.
I'm Anna Sasaki.
I hope I'm not much trouble.
Thank you for having me.
Our pleasure.
Auntie?
She means Yoriko.
Hop on in.
Sorry it's a bit of a clunker.
Sorry.
It's a bit cramped in here.
I don't mind at all.
This area's changed since I was last here.
All these new shops.
Where we're headed is a nice, relaxing place.
But since the highway was built, people stopped coming.
They still haven't fixed that pothole!
I hear you have asthma?
Uh, yes...
The air here will fix you up in no time.
Nice place, huh?
Bet you'd like Auntie to see it, too.
What's that over there?
On the cliff.
Oh, that's a silo.
It's for storing feed for livestock.
Hasn't been used in decades, though.
Now the village kids use it for dares.
They say there are ghosts there.
Dear, please!
He loves stories like that.
Best to stay away from there.
Look, that's our house over there.
Do you mind taking this in?
What's this?
Why would you accept this?
It's too much for us to eat.
He's always accepting gifts without thinking...
Our kids are all grown up and moved out.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you.
Let's see, where do these go?
Excuse me.
MOM DAD You must think it's an odd house.
No, it's a lovely home.
No need for flattery.
Your room's upstairs.
It was my daughter's room.
It'd be sad to clear everything, so I left it as it was.
I see.
She's a yoga teacher in Tokyo now.
I'm thinking of trying it myself.
Oh, and feel free to use the closet and shelves.
Oh, thank you. "Write and tell me how you are, whatever you wish to tell me about.
Yoriko" Postcards, how quaint!
You should write her.
Come here for a sec!
Coming!
He can be so pushy.
See you later.
Smells like someone else's home.
Feels nice.
I've arrived safely.
It's quite nice here.
Mr. and Mrs.
Oiwa are both very kind.
TO YORIKO SASAKI These are delicious.
Sorry, my hands are full.
Um, I'm going to the post office.
Sure, go ahead.
Won't you try this?
Later.
Okay, I'll save it for dessert.
By the way, there's a shortcut by the parking lot.
Oh, thank you.
SHORTCUT This is the shortcut?
SHORTCUT SHORTCUT SHORTCUT KITAHARA GROCERIES Boys just drive me mad!
It's tough being class president.
Wait, I need to drop off a letter.
Hey, who's that?
Why is it...
That mansion feels familiar.
I wonder if anyone lives here.
Excuse me...
What a big house.
I guess there's no one here.
Oh, no...
I'm sorry.
He's a bear.
Or maybe a sea lion.
Sounds like an adventure!
Completely different in high tide, isn't it?
It's the power of the moon.
But imagine that, Toichi giving a girl a ride on his boat.
He's actually a good guy.
Just not much of a talker.
You should ask him for a ride again.
Ask him for a ride.
I will.
But it's best you stay away from the marsh house.
How come?
Ghosts.
Not again!
I'll get some wine.
It looked like no one lives there.
Not now, anyway.
It used to be a vacation home for some foreigners.
Then it changed hands a few times.
But it's been vacant for a while now.
I see...
Someone's there.
Have you finished them yet?
What Mrs.
Kadoya asked for.
Oh...
Almost done.
Hey, Anna.
Going out?
Yes.
Just finish them already...
I'm going to go sketch.
Sure, go on.
Thank you.
Yoriko was worried about her, but she looks fine to me.
As long as she's having fun and eating well.
That's for sure.
All the trash you pick up will be collected here.
Everyone listen!
Now begin!
Look, it's Toichi.
Toichi the mute!
Toichi who only talks once a decade!
Hey, I said we're not going there until later!
We're just checking it out!
See ya!
Perhaps we'll hear from you next time!
I'm going out.
Wait, Anna.
I have a little errand, so hold on.
Yes.
He should be delivering these himself. "I'm allergic to that lady," he says!
But Mrs.
Kadoya's been wanting to meet you.
Their daughter Nobuko is a year older than you.
Nobuko is at cram school today.
Oh, that's too bad.
This must be Anna.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, um...
Hello.
Ah, so you draw, I see?
Show me next time.
No, I'm not very good.
Oh, you should go to the Tanabata Festival with Nobuko tomorrow.
Great idea!
I should still have my daughter's yukata.
You can wear it to the festival.
But...
Yes.
I'll let Nobuko know.
Now come in.
Where'd I put it...
Uh, actually I...
Oh, you're going sketching.
Go ahead!
She'll look great!
Ready, and...
This one, too.
Got it.
I won't look good in it.
None of her business.
He's not here.
Bye.
See you tomorrow.
The tide is out.
Again.
I hate festivals.
Hey, let's go.
Wait for me.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Here's some candy.
Thanks.
I wish I was wearing a yukata, too.
At least you're comfortable.
Mom forces her tastes on me.
It's awful.
I think it looks cute.
What?
No way!
It's boring and tacky...
So Anna, where are you from?
From Sapporo.
Cool, I bet the city has great shopping.
Maybe lots of cute boys, too?
You be quiet.
Sure, sure.
Here in the boonies.
Why'd you come out here?
Well...
What's this?
Nobuko!
What is it?
He's always making the same mistakes.
I'll warn him next time.
TANABATA FESTIVAL There it is.
Will my wish come true?
Can I have a candle?
Here you go.
Write your wish on this.
My wish...
Can you reach?
Ow!
Sorry about that.
Anna!
Hey, where were you?
I was looking for you.
Oh, your wish.
Let's see... "I wish for a normal life everyday." "Normal"?
Anna, what do you mean by normal?
Uh, well...
You see, um...
Hey, your eye color!
What?
It's really pretty.
It's a bit blue, like a foreigner...
Leave me alone!
You fat pig!
Fat...
Uh...
I mean...
I see what you mean by normal.
But there's no use pretending to be normal.
After all, you look like just what you are.
Okay, now let's drop it.
You should join us next-- Anna!
Hey, watch it!
Like just what I am...
Like just what I am...
Ugly, stupid, moody, unpleasant...
That's why...
I hate myself.
That's why everyone...
We don't have long to live.
Typically, you're the ones who-- Still talking about that?
We already settled this matter.
We're not blaming you.
It's just that...
I've already told you.
It's not about money.
I feel bad for her, but-- It'll be best for her if you two-- I'd better get home.
Did someone row it here?
It's stuck!
Throw me the rope!
The rope?
Hurry!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Oh, um...
Are you a real person?
Don't let anyone hear us.
You look like the girl I saw in my dreams.
Dreams?
Thanks.
It's not a dream.
What's your name?
Anna.
I hope we can be friends.
What about you?
Yes.
Have you seen me before?
Yes.
Often.
I just got here.
How long have you been here?
I've been here for ages...
Look at this, the marsh at night.
How beautiful.
Say, let's go down for a closer look.
Madam.
I know.
By the way, where's that child?
Was she not in her room?
I need to get back.
Were they talking about you?
Yes.
At this hour, I'm usually in bed.
Come on, I'll row you back.
So it was your boat.
Yes, I left it for you on purpose.
But I thought you'd be able to row a little better.
I know.
So did I.
You're my precious secret.
I haven't told anyone about you, and I won't.
If someone finds out, they'll only spoil it.
Please, promise me... that we'll remain a secret.
Forever.
Yes.
It'll be our secret.
Forever.
It was awful.
She came home crying her eyes out!
Did Anna do something?
She called my daughter a fat pig!
Fat pig?
And she pulled out a knife, too.
The horror!
I doubt she'd-- No, you need to hear it from the girl herself.
Now bring her here.
Seems she's not home yet.
She's a delinquent, out and about this late!
You two are at fault, too!
Better keep an eye on her.
Take this.
It's dark.
No, thank you.
What if something happens to one of the kids?
So what if she's a bit late!
Don't get so riled up.
She is not a delinquent.
Ah, she's home.
Anna.
Aunt Oiwa...
Were you listening?
Don't you worry.
You two'll make up.
Now take a bath and have dinner.
Thank you.
Or is it dinner before the bath?
It hardly matters.
But "fat pig" is a bit harsh.
That's for sure.
It's not that funny.
Auntie, worrying like always.
Anna!
Watermelon!
Anna?
Two hours until high tide...
Hop in.
Time for a picnic.
I brought juice and cookies.
Picnic?
At this hour?
That's right.
Let's go to the other side of the marsh.
You're very good at rowing.
You need rowing lessons.
Come here.
It's easy.
Remember I said last night that you're my precious secret?
I remember.
And you're my secret.
I'm glad.
Hey!
Good, you're doing well.
But I don't even know your name yet.
I haven't told you yet?
Marnie.
I thought you already knew.
That's dangerous.
Go ahead, just row.
There's so much I want to know about you.
But I don't wish to find out too fast.
Let's take it slow, as we go along.
Okay.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll ask each other three questions a night.
Great.
All right, I'll start.
Question one.
Why are you here in this village?
I have asthma.
The doctor said I should go somewhere with clean air for a while.
Even if I have to skip school.
Oh no, you're ill?
If there's no attack, I'm fine.
So I'm staying here with Auntie's relatives, the Oiwas.
Who's Auntie?
It's my turn to ask a question.
Do you live in that mansion?
Ever since I was two.
With Nan and the maids.
It's juice.
Where are your parents?
They only come here sometimes.
They're busy with work.
I see.
Question two.
Who's Auntie?
My guardian.
But I make her worry too much so she got rid of me for a while.
What do you mean?
I'll explain another time.
It's my turn now.
Do you have siblings?
I'm an only child.
I see, you too...
How come?
Oh, it's nothing.
Just curious what it's like to have siblings.
I know.
It's fun to imagine what it's like.
All right, question three.
What's it like living with the Oiwas?
At the Oiwas?
Huh...
How strange...
I can't... remember...
Marnie?
Marnie!
Anna!
There you are.
I was wondering where you went.
Marnie?
I was looking for you everywhere.
You just disappeared.
I didn't go anywhere.
I was just trying to answer your question.
Wait...
What was it?
It's okay, it doesn't matter.
I need to go soon.
Today is...
Oh, I know!
No, no, no, I really can't!
Parties aren't really my-- Don't worry.
I have a great idea.
It's true.
That's hard to believe.
Sorry, did you wait long?
I had trouble getting away.
Marnie.
What do you think?
It's pretty.
I borrowed Nan's shawl.
I'll be scolded again.
This won't work.
Don't worry, I spoke to Father.
Young lady.
I believe it is past your bedtime.
And who might this be?
She is wearing my shawl.
Upstairs!
Wait right there!
You are nothing but trouble.
You go that way.
Marnie!
Why you little-- Marnie!
Open it!
Let's go.
If you keep this up, you'll grow up to be a lousy adult!
Everyone, we have a lovely flower girl here.
A guest of my daughter.
Ah, a flower girl.
There's Marnie.
She'll be pretty like her mother.
May I please have one of those flowers?
My mother.
Hello, my dear little witch.
That woman there is the real witch.
Um...
I want only one, for good luck.
Will someone kindly pay for my flower?
If it is the witch's command...
Then I'll have one, too.
Here.
For superb luck.
Ah, it's begun.
I'm sorry!
Oh, she ran away.
Come on and take one for good luck!
May I have one, please?
Young lady.
To your health.
Thank you.
Wine?
Are you awake yet?
I...
You drunkard.
Who was that?
Who?
The one who was dancing with you.
Kazuhiko?
He's an old friend.
He's a good dancer.
So are you.
Now let's dance, you and I.
I can't dance.
Just follow my lead.
Look for me again.
And don't tell anyone.
Promise.
I know.
Hey, wait...
Is that-- It's the girl with the Oiwas.
DEAR ANNA, HOW ARE YOU?
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ENJOYING IT...
I HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON.
YORIKO.
I see.
I hope you find the other shoe.
It must be somewhere.
I'll go look for it.
I used to always lose mine.
There's a bunch of shoes buried in the mudflats.
Don't compare her to you.
I should have my daughter's old shoes.
I'll get them out.
Thank you.
Marnie...
Wow.
Not only are they big, they're delicious, too.
You're good with the knife.
Auntie teaches me all the time.
You're so polite and well-behaved.
My daughter could learn from you.
Passing behind you.
I remember when you first came to Yoriko's place.
She was ecstatic.
She wanted to make up for the five years she didn't have with you.
So she taught you things, like knife skills.
But she worries too much.
Always calling me for help.
When I told her I was busy, she started pouting.
Oh, I shouldn't share this about your mother.
No, I understand.
You know, Yoriko sent us tons of photos of you.
I'll show you later.
Hey, look.
Found the wind chime I made on our honeymoon.
To survive the summer.
Your hair's getting long.
Shall I give you a haircut?
That would be a disaster.
Mar... nie...
Look for me again.
How could I nearly forget about Marnie?
Marnie...
Marnie!
Marnie...
May I?
Sure.
I see you draw, too.
That girl looks like someone I knew.
She was a great girl.
Yes, she is.
But I haven't seen her in a week.
I wonder if she's upset that I forgot.
If she's a friend, talk to her and you'll be fine.
Say, will you take a look?
Sure.
Are the colors too messy?
No, it's wonderful.
I'm Hisako.
I'm in love with the marsh house.
What about you?
I'm Anna.
I love it, too.
Better hurry and finish your drawing... before the new folks move in.
The renovations are under way.
Thanks for your hard work.
Have some tea.
Oh, thank you.
Appreciate it.
Hey, let's take a break!
All right, coming.
Are you Marnie?
Come.
I hadn't seen the front before.
It's a lot cleaner now, but it's not finished yet.
Hello.
Hey there.
You brought a friend, huh?
Choose your slippers.
A guest?
Yeah, a secret one.
Secret?
Hey!
Sorry, make yourself at home.
Thank you.
Yes, it's a lovely place.
Yes, we haven't finished renovating.
This room...
Upstairs.
This hasn't been renovated yet.
Here, this is my room.
Really...
What do you think?
It's a cute room.
It used to be your room, right?
You're...
Marnie, right?
Me?
No, no!
But... then why have you been staring at my room?
Because-- See, that's where I always see you.
I've seen you many times.
No, no.
I just love this mansion, that's all.
That can't be.
When I said Marnie earlier, you were surprised.
Rather, why do you know Marnie?
I found it behind the shelf.
A diary?
That's right.
Your diary.
Marnie!
I'll pour you some Queen Mary, your favorite.
I'll be back. "Last night I went for a row in my nightie.
The marsh and the moon were very pretty at night." I shall do it again.
June 8th.
A party!
Father, Mother and many of their friends came over.
It was such fun.
I went outside from the sunroom and danced with a flower girl.
But...
Nan locked me in my room because of last night.
So there won't be any midnight rows for a while.
See, it's you, isn't it?
No.
Marnie is...
Marnie is... someone I made up.
An imaginary girl, only in my mind.
But this is Marnie's diary.
It's as if she really lived here.
So you're not Marnie?
No.
She's just imaginary?
That's right.
I thought you were Marnie, and you came back for the diary...
I'm Anna.
I came from Sapporo to get better.
I'm Sayaka.
I'm from Tokyo.
But if she was imaginary, why is the name in the diary the same?
I don't know.
Marnie must be real.
I'm going to investigate.
Tell me, Marnie...
Who are you?
Is that me?
Marnie?
Marnie!
Um...
Wait, that one's not finished yet...
Wow, you draw well.
Oh, thanks...
I've never had anyone draw me before.
How nice!
I missed you.
I kept calling you in my heart.
Me, too.
Let's go.
Come to my room.
Come to my room, Marnie.
I can't go very far from the mansion.
Okay then, we'll go wherever you want.
You know a lot about mushrooms.
Father taught me when I was little.
I once brought home three bags full of mushrooms.
The look on Mother's face!
What's wrong?
You're so quiet all of a sudden.
You're very lucky.
I wish I was you.
Talk to me.
I'm... a foster child.
My real parents died when I was little.
My grandmother, too.
I know they didn't die on purpose, but... sometimes I feel like...
I can't forgive them... for leaving me all alone.
I'm jealous of you.
You're lucky to be a foster child.
If you had no relatives, then the folks who took you in as a daughter must be truly kindhearted people.
Then I'll tell you a big secret.
It's about my foster parents.
They're good to me and they're kind.
I'm not their real child, yet they raised me, which I appreciate.
But you see, I saw it one day.
They're paid to look after me.
Paid?
I found a letter from the government.
It said they were increasing the subsidy for me.
I'm sure there's a reason-- I don't care!
They wouldn't get money if I were their real child.
They get paid because I'm not their real child.
Even worse... they hide it from me.
I see.
But that doesn't mean Auntie doesn't love you.
No!
Don't you see?
None of the other families receive money.
Just us!
She always looks worried that I might find out.
And I hate myself for thinking like this.
I... just can't... believe... in anything anymore.
Anna, it's okay to cry.
Just know that I love you.
I love you more than any girl I've ever known.
Then you tell me your secret.
A long time ago, I went mushrooming with Father.
Nowadays, I hardly see my parents.
Mother's usually travelling.
Because of work, Father's home only twice a year.
Usually, Nan and the twin maids are the only ones home.
With me.
I slip out while they're gossiping.
And look how free I get to be!
It's so lovely when my parents come home.
They host parties!
Like the other day.
With my amazing parents and many people there, it's delightful.
I get to wear new dresses and dance, too.
That's when I feel I'm the luckiest girl in the world.
I see.
Tell me, Anna.
Will you be my friend forever?
Yes.
I'm your friend forever.
Right?
Nan's always in a bad mood.
She yanks me by the arm, brushes my hair very hard...
No one thinks I'm being bullied.
But it really hurts.
Enough to cry.
The maids love to frighten me.
They threatened me all the time. "Naughty kids get locked up in the silo where ghosts suck out their souls," they said.
You mean, the silo on the hill?
Once, they actually took me there.
No!
They dragged me all the way to the silo.
I thought I'd die of fright.
Then suddenly, just as we got there, the sky went dark and a storm broke out.
The maids were terrified, so we didn't go inside.
I can endure anything else.
Anything but the silo.
I have never heard such a terrible thing!
I hope the maids and Nan get struck by lightning!
Hasn't anyone ever tried to frighten you?
Never.
Definitely not on purpose.
You're lucky.
I wish I was you.
Our castle...
Poor Marnie.
I love you so much.
More than anyone I've known.
Thank you.
It's funny.
It's like we traded places.
How true.
The tide's coming in.
Hey, let's go to the silo together.
The ghosts must be a lie.
Let's go make sure.
Tomorrow...
No, let's go right now.
I don't care who Marnie really is.
I just want to help her.
Are you okay, Marnie?
Yes, I'm sure I'll be all right if I'm with you...
Kazuhiko.
Anna!
Perfect timing!
I found it!
The rest of the diary.
Come to my place.
Marnie...
I'm sorry.
Another time.
What?
But it's a major discovery...
It's going to rain!
Who is it?
Is someone there?
Marnie!
So you did go ahead.
Don't scare me like that.
Marnie.
Are you okay?
Why did you-- Kazuhiko!
I'm scared.
I heard somebody below.
I thought I'd die of fright.
Kazuhiko...
What're you saying?
I'm Anna.
Pull yourself together.
Anna...
Anna!
I don't want to be humiliated.
But I haven't the courage.
Oh, Anna...
You do have courage.
You came here.
Let's go home.
Wait!
It's just the wind.
Let's go.
We'll go home together.
No...
Anna, come back here.
Anna!
We got all the way up here.
I'm sure we can make it down.
I'll go first, so follow me.
No, don't leave me!
No!
Marnie!
Let's go over there.
I'm cold...
So cold...
Oh Anna, I'm scared...
I'm scared...
Don't worry, we'll be fine if we're together.
You did well, Marnie.
Are you okay?
Kazuhiko!
I thought you'd never come.
I...
I...
Let's go home.
Marnie?
Marnie!
Marnie!
Marnie...
You left me behind!
Even you!
Kazuhiko...
Kazuhiko...
Kazuhiko's all over this diary. "Kazuhiko is trying to take me to the silo." Silo...
Yes?
Mom cooked some corn.
Hurry or it'll be gone.
Wait!
Why go out on a night like this?
It's not safe.
My friend might be caught in the rain.
What if she gets pneumonia?
Is that...
Anna!
Are you okay?
So cruel...
Anna?
So cruel, Marnie...
She has a high fever!
I'll go get some help.
Anna.
Anna?
Anna...
How's she doing?
Her fever's not coming down.
She did get a shot earlier.
I see.
So cruel...
Marnie, how could you?
I won't forgive you.
Leaving me behind without a word.
Anna!
My dear Anna!
Marnie!
How could you leave me behind?
Why did you betray me?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to leave you all alone.
But...
But at that moment, you weren't there.
What do you mean?
Oh, Anna, I...
I can't stay here any longer.
I have to say goodbye to you.
So please, Anna, please tell me you forgive me!
Anna...
Of course, I forgive you!
I love you, Marnie!
And I won't forget you!
I'll never forget you!
Ever!
Anna.
Sayaka's here for you.
Thanks.
You could see her in your room.
No, it's nice outside.
THE VIEW HERE IS BEAUTIFUL.
I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU.
ANNA Sayaka.
Here, a get-well gift.
Thanks.
Also...
This is what made me think you might be at the silo.
What is it?
The rest of the diary you promised to read.
I'm having trouble remembering.
I impressed myself.
I found a clue in this painting that was behind the cupboard.
Maybe I'm psychic.
Turn it over.
Hisako!
Hisako!
Please, will you tell us about Marnie?
But... it's a rather sad story.
I'm ready for it.
It was a long time ago.
I used to play at the marsh house often.
Marnie and I were very little.
It's a bear!
Let me see.
This is Daddy.
Isn't he dashing?
Marnie loved to boast about her glamorous parents and their extravagant parties.
But the truth is, she was being neglected.
Goodbye, Marnie.
That poor child...
No, don't leave me, Mommy!
Don't go!
It seemed like even the maids were bullying her.
That's awful!
Later, Marnie moved to Sapporo and married Kazuhiko, her childhood friend.
With her family torn apart and feeling lost, he was there to support her.
I'm glad.
So Kazuhiko was a good man.
Two years later, Emily was born.
At last, in the warm household she'd always wanted, Marnie was happy.
I didn't see Marnie for many years after that.
The next time was... a few years after Kazuhiko had died of an illness.
By then, Marnie was in a sanatorium due to the shock of his death.
Sanatorium?
A place where you go to get better.
What happened to Emily?
Marnie's parents had died, leaving no one to look after her.
So for elementary school, she was sent to a boarding school.
By the time she returned at age 13, she'd become a different person.
Emily!
She was willful and independent.
She knew Marnie was ill, but she still resented her for sending her away.
You think that makes you more motherly?
I want you to live the way you wish, but... you need to...
They never did make up after that.
As your mother-- I've never thought of you as a mother.
Emily ran away and soon got married.
She was expecting, you see.
But...
One day, Emily and her husband died in a car accident.
I heard Marnie took their child in.
She was determined to never let this child be lonely.
But... she never got over losing Emily.
She became very ill and died the following year.
That was about ten years ago.
I'm sorry, it's a sad story.
No, thank you very much.
Marnie adored that mansion.
She loved seeing the marsh from her window.
She said it felt like the birds spoke to her.
She had a lonely life, but she lived it fully.
She always had a smile on her face.
She was determined to be happy.
So you've met Marnie, too.
I wish we could've played more, Anna.
The plan was always for me to stay just for the summer.
Will you come back next summer?
I'm sure I will.
I'll write you.
I'll write you, too.
I put the diary and painting back where I found them.
Good, it's for the best.
I haven't told my family.
Let's keep it our secret.
How funny...
Marnie brought us together.
That's true.
Marnie...
The girl trapped behind the blue window...
That was long ago.
Exactly, he does it to save her life.
I love that part.
Ah, now I want to read it all over again.
I'll lend you the sequel.
Anna!
Auntie!
Anna...
Hey, be careful!
Sorry, sorry.
Auntie's here.
Ah, Yoriko, you're here.
Thank you for everything.
She's doing well, and even made a friend.
How can I ever repay you?
Oh, no.
We didn't do anything at all.
Anna is a good girl.
It was like having our own daughter back.
She's welcome anytime.
Thank you.
Let's talk inside.
I'm impressed.
You didn't call us once!
I'm all packed.
Anna.
Yes?
There's something I need to tell you.
We receive monthly subsidies to cover your expenses.
We receive money.
I've long hesitated to tell you, but-- It's okay.
But believe me...
Whether or not we receive money, it doesn't change our love for you.
I already knew.
I'm happy you told me about it.
Anna!
I've been looking at the photos you sent.
Photos?
Oh, while you were away I was looking at old albums and found this picture.
Do you remember?
It's that mansion.
When you first came to us, you wouldn't let it go.
I was told at the orphanage it belonged to your grandmother.
MY BELOVED HOME - MARNIE Marnie!
So that's who she was.
Anna.
And so I was in the silo all night.
I was very frightened.
That's when your grandpa came.
He encouraged me, saying I did well.
I've overcome many frightening things.
And so will you, Anna.
After all, you're my one and only grandchild.
Grandma...
Excuse me.
Anna.
I'm sorry for what I said.
Next year, you better join us to pick up the trash.
A friend?
Maybe.
Hisako!
Anna.
I'm going home to Sapporo now.
Is that right?
But your face tells me something good happened.
Yes, I'm really happy now.
Good.
Um, this is my mother.
Thank you for being kind to Anna.
Oh no, it was my pleasure.
Let's draw together again.
Yes.
I'll write you.
I have some amazing news.
Goodbye.
Thank you very much.
Amazing news?
Yeah, I'll tell you later.
Oh, why not now?
I promise I'll tell you.
Toichi!
Sayaka!
Goodbye!
THE END
ONLY YESTERDAY With ten days off, I figured you'd go abroad.
But you're off to Yamagata, right?
Yes.
Broke up with your boyfriend?
I just prefer the countryside.
See ya!
Bye!
Let's go to your place!
No way.
Why?
Because...
Later!
Did you get good grades?
No, but I don't care.
How come?
As soon as I get home, we're traveling to Grandma's.
So I won't get yelled at for ages.
Lucky you!
Are you going away too?
Yeah, to Nagano.
How about you, Taeko?
I'm not sure.
My dad bought a summer home.
Wow... that's great.
Such a bad grade in math again.
But I got a "B" in science.
Are we going away for the vacation?
Not really.
Take me someplace.
I'll take you to a movie.
How about "The Crane Lady"?
Not that.
I mean to the country...
The country?
Like Grandma's country house.
Grandma lives with us.
Grandpa's then...
He's dead.
We don't have relatives in the country, so don't ask.
My family had lived in Tokyo for generations.
I envied friends who had family in the countryside.
It's too late to book.
All hotels will be full.
But I really want to go...
What about Onoya?
Huh?
We're regulars.
They'd have a room for us.
Where's that?
Good idea.
Taeko's never been there.
That's right.
Is it in the mountains?
By the sea?
It's in Atami.
Atami?
You get to ride the bullet train.
Sure, you'll love it.
Atami...
It's great!
Lots of different hot springs...
There's the huge Roman Bath.
And other little ones, like the Swan Bath and the Violet Bath.
The beautiful Violet Bath!
The Violet Bath...
Oh yes.
It's fantastic.
You love hot springs, right?
Since Father's working, you four go.
What?
Us?
Go too?
I'm amazed you show up every morning.
Everyone else has left town.
Aren't you going anywhere?
Yes, I am.
Where?
Atami.
Atami?
What's in Atami?
Hot springs.
It's good timing.
We're going away next week to visit relatives.
No one will be around for ages.
Hello.
Okajima residence.
Nanako?
It's Taeko.
I leave today.
Any messages for your husband's family?
Not really.
Just bring them something.
Maybe cookies.
Say it's from us and I'll pay you back.
Don't worry about it.
How's Mom?
She's out today.
She was mad you turned down that guy's proposal. "At 27, that's the best offer she's going to get!" It's all she talks about.
She's got a point.
You're not young anymore.
Oh, yeah?
Definitely.
You've got to settle down eventually.
By the way, did you really work in the fields last year?
Yes, harvesting rice.
This year, I'm picking safflower.
Safflower?
Thanks to you, I finally have family in the countryside.
So, I'm making the most of it!
Give me a break!
Rather than stay in that old house, why not treat yourself to a fancy hotel for once?
Maybe you'd meet a nice boy.
No way.
You mean a hotel like Onoya?
Onoya?
Not that again!
You've got to get over it.
Let go of that baggage from the past!
My sisters, of course, would never go to a place like Atami.
Grandma...
Almost done?
Let's go to another bath.
We just went.
Only to the Swan Bath.
Bored to tears, I went alone to the Brothers Grimm Bath, the Mermaid Bath, the Lemon Bath, and the Violet Bath, one after the other.
It's enormous!
When I got to the Roman Bath, my head was spinning.
It's amazing...
And I fainted.
And with that, my trip was over.
Followed by endless weeks of vacation.
Jump on both feet.
Now your arms and legs.
The other day, my sisters and I were reminiscing.
We couldn't stop laughing as the memories came flooding back.
Had one before?
No, it's my first time.
I'm the one who asked for it.
Yeah, we know.
Where did you buy it?
Senbikiya in Ginza.
Must have been expensive.
How do we eat it?
Slice it into rings.
But how?
I don't know.
Didn't you ask in the store?
We'll eat it next Sunday.
Why not now?
We don't know how.
I'll have a banana.
Me too.
Strange fruit they have in those hot countries.
I'm home!
I know how to eat the pineapple!
Really?
I'll take that.
Mind your fingers.
Wouldn't a carving knife be best?
What a nice smell.
It smells so good.
I see.
Get plates.
Quick.
Okay.
Let us eat.
It's chewy.
Nothing special.
Not so sweet.
Nothing like the canned stuff.
Live long enough and you see lots of different things.
You can have mine.
Mine too.
It's delicious...
Don't force yourself.
You'll get a stomachache.
What a letdown.
Bananas taste much better.
You're so right.
Bananas are still the king of fruit.
I'll have one now.
If you had to deceive me I wish that you had deceived me Until my death A red-ruby...
The king of fruit is... the banana, after all.
BEST SELLING PRODUCT The year I fainted at the baths and had my first pineapple... the Beatles came to Japan, and started the rock 'n' roll band and electric guitar craze.
My sister Nanako, a freshman in art school, was up on all the trends.
Yeah, the Beatles' lyrics are great.
When she wore a mini-skirt, she'd cover her bottom going up the stairs.
My clever sister, Yaeko, was crazy about some Takarazuka actress.
Yaeko...
I told you to knock!
My sisters' memories are mainly of fashion and pop trends.
For them, 1966 is the height of nostalgia.
Whereas I was only ten years old.
My favorite band had yet to debut...
My only memories are the back and forth between school and home.
Mine was pinned on the wall!
That's nice.
And it might be entered in an essay contest.
The teacher said to take good care of it.
I'd be so happy...
You didn't finish lunch again.
Why do you hide the pickles inside the bread? 'Cause I hate them.
I've got to throw it away.
What a waste.
Such a picky eater!
I'd rather you were a good eater than a good essay writer.
How can you drink that horrible stuff?
Milk's okay.
It's onions I hate.
I'm leaving carrots so I've got no choice.
Who decided we can only leave one thing?
Shall I drink it?
Would you?
You'll eat my onions next time?
Thank you.
Carrots?
We're allowed one thing!
Two bowls is gross.
People who run in the hall when the hall monitor says stop should be punished.
How are you gonna do that?
They shouldn't do it.
That's right.
You might bump into someone.
If I bumped into you I'd bounce a mile!
Get lost!
Oof.
Running is no big deal.
I agree!
Let's change the rule.
But we already decided.
What's the big deal?
Raise your hand if you want to speak.
Here!
Miss Tani.
The hall monitor should chase the offenders, catch them and punish them.
Me!
Hey, me!
Mr.
Suzuki.
Then the hall monitor should also be punished for running.
He's right!
He's right!
Way to go!
He's right.
Miss Tani.
The hall monitor shouldn't be punished because... it's like a policeman chasing a speeding car.
Any objections?
A policeman?
No more running.
So, the hall monitor can chase offenders.
Any other issues?
Here.
Miss Tani.
Her again.
Busybody.
Be quiet.
Some people don't finish lunch.
I just read an article on the Vietnam War.
There are many unfortunate people overseas.
We're very lucky.
Lucky to have you near me!
We should be grateful for our food.
We're allowed to leave one thing on our plates, but I think it's wrong!
Goody two-shoes.
It can't hurt to leave one thing.
Let's all leave milk...
Give it to someone else...
Of course.
People hide leftovers in bread.
That's cheating!
I hate school food.
Order!
If you want to speak, raise your hand!
What a revolting situation.
That night in bed, after chatting to my sisters, more memories from fifth grade came rushing back.
Our pet dog...
School sports day...
Being scared by gross horror comics... longing for an electric pencil sharpener...
So many little details, one after the other... playing in my head like a movie, almost overpowering me.
Is there a Miss Okajima here?
That's her.
Show me!
No!
Hirota in our class says he likes you.
Let's go.
We'll say we told you.
Hurry!
Come on!
Told you.
Where is it?
Over there.
SHUJI HIROTA AND TAEKO OKAJIMA It's true!
What's he like?
No idea.
Me, neither.
Taeko, you sure you don't know him?
No... of course not...
Not at all.
Which one is Hirota?
It's the Room Five girls.
Hirota, they're looking for you.
Yes, I'm here!
Don't write silly things on the wall.
Taeko told us to tell you.
I didn't write anything.
You said you liked Okajima in Room Five.
You did.
So, we wrote it for you.
I love you so much But you're so far away Like a distant star Goodbye.
A far distant star Taeko!
We just went to see Hirota.
We told him not to write things on walls.
Tsuneko!
Ah, no running.
Aren't you glad?
ROOM FOUR Wasn't it funny?
Over here.
See?
That's him.
What?
Hirota likes Taeko?
He's amazing.
A real star.
You mean baseball?
Only Tono can hit his pitches.
Really?
Our team plays his in the next game.
Go, go, Hirota!
Go for it, Tono!
Hit it, Tono!
Kill it!
Go for it, Hirota!
Taeko's watching you!
Hit it, Tono!
Way to go, Hirota!
Strike him out!
Don't you dare cheer their side!
Of course not!
Go, go, Tono!
Go, go, Tono!
Go, go, Tono!
Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!
Go Hirota!
Hit it!
One leg stance!
Strike!
Strike!
Strike!
You're out!
Wow!
Way to go, Hirota!
Way to go, Hirota!
I knew nothing about baseball.
But even I could tell he was superb.
Go, go, Hirota!
What's up, Taeko?
Between the cold and the excitement, I ran to the bathroom five times.
Over here, over here!
Saved!
GIRLS' BATHROOM Game!
Five to three.
Room Four wins.
Thank you for the game.
You were great Hirota!
Good job.
You were amazing!
It was all your fault.
How come?
You don't know anything.
If Tono couldn't get a hit off him, then how was I supposed to?
That's right.
You missed it and they scored three runs.
That's not true.
Good game.
Coach said he'd buy us ice cream.
Really?
Great!
Hirota, you should go see her.
Yeah, you should.
I'm going home.
What's the matter, Taeko?
Look, she left.
Um... that stuff... on the wall...
Rainy days or... cloudy or sunny days... which do you like best?
Cloudy.
Me too!
Rainy days or cloudy or sunny days.
Which do you like best?
Me too.
I didn't intend for ten-year-old me to come on this trip.
But somehow, once she showed up, she wouldn't leave me alone.
But why fifth-grade me?
Second hour, all boys play baseball, all girls to PE. -How come? -Baseball, great! -Why? -Do we have to miss PE?
Today I'm going to talk about something very important.
You'll finish grade school, then junior high, then high school.
Then become grown-ups and have babies.
A woman's body prepares to have babies.
Did you know?
Really?
Mom told me when I was in fourth grade, since I'm precocious.
Precocious?
That's right.
She said tall girls or big girls get their periods early.
I bet those other girls already have theirs.
Are you gonna buy them?
I am.
I knew it.
You'll buy them too, right?
Well... yeah.
I think you should.
The nurse said we all need them eventually.
That's true.
The girls are buying underpants in the infirmary.
Did you know?
No.
But why?
How come you're buying underpants?
It's because...
Umm...
Why is the school selling underpants?
Are they for swimming?
GIRLS' BATHROOM You told Nakayama?
Why did you do that?
You shouldn't tell boys.
It's supposed to be our secret.
It's because she likes him.
Did he ask you?
What's going on?
She told Nakayama about periods.
No!
He'll tell everyone.
I told you to keep it secret.
You trust him?
Right.
Right.
Oh no...
Boys are disgusting.
Now they'll be looking up our skirts.
Panties.
Saved.
Pervert!
Looking up skirts was all the rage and periods became an obsession.
You got your period!
Cut it out!
Second period break.
Idiot.
Ouch.
Come here!
You have your period.
No, I don't!
It's all Rie's fault.
I'm sorry.
What for?
For telling Nakayama.
It doesn't matter.
The nurse said it's very important.
I know.
They started when I was in fourth grade.
Really?
That's why I get to skip PE sometimes.
Having your periods lets you skip PE?
Mom said I should.
He even said he felt sorry for us.
You told him about skipping PE?
He promised not to tell the others.
Now they'll think all girls who skip PE are on their periods!
You think so?
Of course!
PLEASE EXCUSE TAEKO FROM GYM CLASS BECAUSE OF HER COLD PARENT-TEACHER CONTACT BOOK I'm not missing PE.
Your cold will get worse.
Then I'll stay home.
No.
You don't have a fever.
Then I'm going to PE.
Fine, go ahead.
Don't blame me if it gets worse.
See you later.
When did she become so fond of Phys Ed?
You're bright red.
She's right.
Are you okay?
I have a cold.
You have a fever.
You should skip PE.
Yeah, you should.
I'll go tell the teacher.
No, don't.
Why not?
Mom already wrote a note.
There's no problem then.
Right?
Out of the way!
Ouch!
I'm missing PE too.
Just like you.
They're so lucky.
I wish I could play, too.
Do you... are you on your period?
Yes.
I'm not.
I have a cold.
I know.
You're sick.
Just sick.
That's all.
Periods aren't a disease.
I could still play...
I'm gonna catch a period!
Don't touch it, don't touch it!
That was close.
Almost caught it...
Over here, over here! "Catch a period"!
What a silly thing to say.
It's no laughing matter!
Taeko?
SHOES CONTAINER It's the period pair!
No, we're not!
Stupid boys.
You're so relaxed about it.
Mom said it's nothing to be ashamed of.
I guess so, but...
Like it or not, a caterpillar must first... live as a chrysalis before it turns into a butterfly.
Maybe I remember those days because...
I am going through a chrysalis phase once again.
Something definitely changed when I started working.
At work and at play we girls were livelier and more spirited than the guys.
It was like we'd finally found our wings.
But looking back now, maybe we were just flapping them pointlessly.
Perhaps fifth-grade me was tagging along with a message for me to ponder and to rethink my life.
Anyway, I decided to sleep the rest of the way.
ENTRANCE Ouch!
EMERGENCY EXIT ENTRANCE Excuse me, has the Tokyo train left?
Was that your train?
No...
Taeko Okajima, right?
Yes, that's correct...
Thank goodness.
The car's this way.
Excuse me, but who are you?
You don't remember?
Of course you don't.
I'm Toshio.
Kazuo's second cousin.
Oh, I see...
What's so funny?
Nothing.
Sorry.
I thought you were trying to steal my bag.
That's terrible.
Didn't I ask your name?
Yes, you did.
I just thought...
Sorry...
I beg your pardon.
No problem.
Where's Kazuo?
He asked me last night to come pick you up.
It's been raining?
Yeah, but it'll clear today.
I should've used my dad's car.
But I like mine better.
It's a little tight.
May I leave it on?
Sure.
This is unusual music.
It's a Hungarian group.
Hungarian?
You know a lot about it?
A little.
It's farmer's music.
I like it because I'm a farmer.
Cool.
Right?
Remember last year's party at the farmhouse?
A bunch of guys turned up, right?
Maybe you don't remember.
They came to check out the girl from Tokyo.
I was one of them.
Watch out, jerk!
I heard you're picking safflower.
Do you dye fabric?
No.
I'm just curious.
Safflower's kind of unusual.
Well, maybe not for you.
It's known as a famous local product but... hardly anyone grows it.
Wasn't it big in the old days?
For the merchants, sure.
They got rich, but for farmers, it was just another crop.
Do you know: "I wonder whose skin in the future This crimson flower will touch" The famous Basho poem?
I read it before coming.
Is that so?
I only learned it last night.
I also read that the flower pickers couldn't afford to wear the rouge they made.
Is that where you had the barbecue?
There'll be another this year, too.
Are market reforms making agriculture difficult?
Absolutely.
As things go, Japanese farming might just collapse, all of a sudden, one day.
But then again, anything worth struggling for will be hard work.
Isn't it the same in the city?
Yes.
But fewer people live for their work.
What about you?
Me?
I don't live for my job but I don't hate it either.
I could farm 24 hours a day.
It's fascinating to raise living things.
You have livestock?
Not that.
We've got some animals, but I'm talking about rice, apples, cherries.
They're all living things.
If we take good care of them, I feel like they'll do their best for us.
Listen to me preach.
Not at all.
I get what you mean.
To tell the truth, I used to work in an office.
I only just started farming.
Is that right?
That's why I'm so enthusiastic.
It's very important.
I quit work and joined my friend's organic farm.
People said I'm nuts, but I don't regret it.
Organic farm? "Grown with no artificial chemicals whatsoever." Just blood, sweat and tears!
We use all natural stuff, no pesticides or anything.
I've seen the labels: "No chemicals used".
But it's not just that.
We bring out the plant's life force.
It's cool... like lending nature a hand.
Sounds easy, but it's damn hard work.
I was told to take you straight to the fields.
Yes, I'm starting right away.
Not going to rest?
Don't you pick the flowers early while the thorns are still soft?
That's right, but...
I'm trying to become an early riser.
That's why I took the night train.
You're certainly eager.
There it is!
Good morning!
Great to have you back, Taeko.
Thanks for having me.
Grandma, you're looking well.
Welcome back, dear.
Aren't you tired?
No, not at all.
We made your bed just in case.
That's okay.
Look, I'm raring to go!
Wearing work pants too!
That's all I brought.
Young people here don't wear them anymore.
You look like the real thing, Taeko.
That's right.
Taeko!
Don't!
And so began my second taste of country life.
How could this yellow flower produce such a bright red?
They told me a sad tale from the old days.
The girls didn't have gloves, and their bare hands would get pricked by the thorns.
It was their blood that made the red so deep.
I could imagine the resentment they must've felt toward the fancy city girls.
To make a handful of rouge took nearly sixty baskets of petals.
This rouge was literally worth its weight in gold.
The petals are washed, trodden, then exposed to the air and the sun.
As the petals oxidize, they gradually tum red.
After a few more days, fermentation turns them bright red and they become sticky.
Pounded, wrung into balls and sun-dried, they finally become the basic ingredient of rouge.
The liquid from the pressing wasn't wasted either.
The red pigment in the yellow broth was used to dye fabric.
Let's go dye our cloth.
Safflower do your best.
Cheer me up with your pretty color.
For those village girls, with no chance of wearing make-up or kimonos, safflower dye brought color into their drab lives.
The yellow pigment dissolves in water leaving the fabric a light pink.
So pretty!
Machines now take away some of the work, but the petals still need to be picked every day.
Rouge cakes soon go moldy, and the flowers wait for no one.
No sooner are you done picking, than they bloom again.
When the rains come, work continues into the early hours.
Each day flew by.
Pleasantly tired, I thought about the flower pickers of old.
If I could've worked like this as a child, my school essays would've been really interesting.
Mom, I need 5,000 yen. 5,000 yen?
I can't give you that.
You said you'd buy me new sneakers.
Are they that expensive?
Nonsense.
They're Pumas.
Pumas?
It's a brand.
I'm not sure.
There must be cheaper ones.
How about the ones you've got?
Nobody wears them now.
Everyone's getting Pumas.
Who's everyone?
Kako, Megu, Yachan, Nonchan.
That's only four people.
Everyone's wearing them!
No.
You never do your chores.
Did you ask for a dress for your Barbie doll again?
Didn't you promise to ask only for Christmas and your birthday?
You always spoil her.
Is that right, Taeko?
All of a sudden, the ten-year-old me was back.
But...
Yaeko got a kimono and it wasn't even her graduation.
It's for the tea ceremony.
You keep asking for lots of little stuff, we get one or two big things.
Right?
Yep.
Stop that.
Always picky about food.
Dad loves the onions, right?
Yes.
Anyway, that kimono will be yours in the end.
Always hand-me-downs.
Some people don't get anything.
Exactly.
Then give me that patent leather purse.
Didn't you give it to her yet?
You're too old for that.
Give it to her.
I don't want it.
Keep the stupid purse.
Then I won't give it to you.
I'm not buying you a new one.
Fine.
Good.
I actually really like it.
I hate it.
Ready for dinner.
Take this away.
See, has to be thrown away.
What a waste.
Don't throw it away!
Please, Mother.
It's your fault.
Finish it yourself next time.
You three are so selfish.
Father, buy me a patent leather purse.
Yaeko won't give me hers.
You said you didn't want it.
Yeah, but...
You said it, you have to live with it.
Hurry up and get ready.
I'll wear these!
Why is Yaeko coming?
You said it was just the three of us.
Because I finished my homework.
Is that a problem?
It's Chinese food.
The more the merrier.
Grandma's not coming.
She doesn't eat greasy food.
If you don't want to come, stay here.
We're going, Taeko.
Come on, slowpoke.
I don't have a purse.
Lend her that patent leather one.
Here.
Ouch.
Let's go.
I'm not going.
Okay.
Let's go, Mother.
Stay with Grandma then.
Not coming, Taeko?
No, I'm not.
We're off then.
I'm coming too!
No shoes!
Father, please.
A button came off.
We didn't go out, of course.
My face was swollen and a cold towel didn't stop the stinging.
That night I couldn't sleep, wondering why it was always me.
Figuring I must've been adopted, I cried myself to sleep.
Was it the first time he hit you?
Yes, the first and only time.
Dad slaps me often... well, sometimes.
Maybe that's easier.
When it's only once, you can't stop thinking why.
It's hard to imagine you as a selfish brat.
A spoiled brat.
I wasn't just fussy about onions, either.
Now I don't feel like I'm that bad.
Wait a second!
Your poor mom.
I shouldn't encourage you.
I'm giving up on the Pumas.
Good girl.
Maybe I'll slip you some pocket money.
Yay!
Hey! 100 yen each.
Taeko...
Tomorrow...
Let's go for a drive to Zao.
Zao?
Yes.
You went to Yamadera last year, right?
The family said it was okay.
The views at Zao were beautiful.
But Zao had become famous and touristy.
How come you're not married?
Do you find that strange?
Well, no, not really.
Lots of women work now.
Most of my friends are single.
Oh, is that right?
That's right.
I see.
It's true.
Right.
Really.
It's very common.
Toshio?
In elementary school, could you divide fractions?
When they said reverse the numerator and denominator, could you do it?
I don't remember.
I wasn't bad at math though.
I see.
Lucky you.
I bet you don't remember because it was easy.
Maybe.
Why do you ask?
It seems that people who could do it went on to have easy lives.
One girl, completely average... not even good at math, always could do it perfect right away.
She grew up really normal and now is married with two kids.
I was no good at it.
Not smart enough to know when to quit.
ROOM FIVE, TAEKO OKAJIMA, 25 POINTS Before the test... we had art class.
And... um... we did blow pictures.
Blow pictures?
Yes.
We drop paint on the paper... and blow patterns in it.
And?
You blow like this, really hard, right?
Yes?
So, I got a headache.
From blowing so hard.
That's why you did so badly?
That's right.
I see.
Do you know the answers now?
The correct answers?
Have Yaeko help you with them.
Yaeko?
That's right.
Or Nanako, whichever.
I'll ask Nanako.
Nanako's not back yet.
Can I wait till after dinner?
I'll ask Yaeko...
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
What is this?
How on earth...
Please teach her.
She doesn't seem to get it.
But this is beyond belief!
That's why I'm asking you.
Is she alright in the head?
Just help her.
Normally this is easy.
But that child's not normal!
Taeko, your sister's going to help.
You had a headache from blowing, didn't you?
Sit.
Say your times table from the top.
I know that.
I'm in fifth grade already!
Then why so many mistakes?
It's dividing fractions.
Just flip the top and the bottom and multiply.
They taught you that, right?
Then why do you get it wrong?
Yaeko, one step at a time.
What's dividing a fraction by a fraction anyway?
Two-thirds of an apple divided by a quarter means... how this would be divided among four people, right?
So, it's one, two, three, four, five, six... one-sixth each, right?
No, no, no, no.
That's multiplication.
How come it's less when you multiply?
Two-thirds of an apple divided by a quarter...
Anyway!
Forget about apples.
Just remember to invert and multiply.
Is her sister in Takarazuka?
No, S.K.D.
She got a "D" in math.
A "D"?
Yes, and just barely.
If she got half right, it'd be worth scolding her.
Right.
Should you get her IQ checked?
They said it was fine when she started.
Maybe she turned dumb?
Remember she fell down the stairs as a baby?
Right, in her walker!
I thought she was dead.
It was just a bump.
It's affecting her now.
That's it!
Nonsense.
She's just no good at math.
She chats too much in class.
If she'd just listen...
Even an idiot can do it.
Only two more years until junior high.
Two-thirds of this apple, divided by a quarter...
I can't even picture it.
Two-thirds of this, into a quarter makes it...
Even now, dividing fractions is difficult.
We farmers give up too easily.
We just yield to the flow and follow what they do in the cities.
Let's rethink the real meaning of prosperity.
Return to the old ways of farming.
You made me jump...
So, that explains the organic farming?
I'm just quoting my friend.
But I agree with it.
It's great the way you hold onto your memories of math class.
It wasn't meant to impress you.
People say you work in a great place, but I could never give myself up to it completely.
I really admire your devotion to farming.
You're being sarcastic?
Of course not!
There aren't many people like you.
Farming's in total decline, right?
So we can't just carry on as normal.
We've got to think about the future.
We help each other out, cheer one another along, otherwise we can't keep it up.
Taeko, do you ski?
I've been with friends a few times.
Come next winter.
I'll teach you.
Are you good?
I'm not too bad.
But I'm an instructor here.
An instructor?
You must be great.
All my friends are too.
At last, we're in the middle of nowhere. "Nowhere", huh?
Sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.
Interesting point though.
City people see the trees and rivers and are grateful for "nature".
But what you see here is all made by man.
By man?
Farmers.
That wood?
Yes.
Those trees?
Yes.
That stream?
Yes.
Every bit has its history, not just the fields and rice paddies, someone's great-great-grandpa planted it, or cleared it, gathered firewood or picked mushrooms there.
I see.
Mankind battles nature and gets stuff from it.
They evolve together, and it created this scenery.
So without man, this wouldn't exist?
Farmers can't exist without nature.
So they've always taken great care to give her a helping hand in return.
A collaboration between man and nature...
That's the heart of country life.
That's why I feel so at home.
I didn't grow up here, but somehow always felt... my soul was at home here.
So that's it...
My back aches.
What's so great about organic farming?
Only the theory.
Like I said... giving nature a hand is hard work.
Things haven't changed in a hundred years.
No, even "organic" rice uses weed killer.
There's not enough labor to weed by hand.
You're really working hard.
How about some tea?
Fantastic.
I felt like having a break.
Toshio let me try a variety of things... until I felt I knew all about country life.
How wonderful. "Behold, the crows fly home.
First one..." At last I can say this in the right setting.
It was my line in a school play.
I was "Village Child A".
Oh, I see.
I only ever had small roles too.
And you, Naoko?
Only lead roles, since there are so few of us.
These days people leave and go to the cities.
And now there are fewer kids.
I see.
But getting the big roles must be fun.
Not really.
I prefer sports.
I'm a pretty fast runner.
Good for you.
I was always mediocre.
The sports version of "Village Child A".
Still, I'll never forget that line as long as I live.
It was going to make me a star.
A star?
Yes.
What kind of star?
That tiny role?
Yes.
Even though you weren't the lead?
Yes.
Because I was the most enthusiastic. 'Cause you were the cutest?
No, not that!
I rehearsed endlessly in front of the mirror.
Even for "Village Child A"...
The line was so short, I felt something was missing. "Behold, the crows fly home.
First one..." I know.
You made up more!
Exactly.
Look up there, the crows fly home.
First one...
Then two...
Then three...
Then four...
Farewell, dear crows.
You take care now. -And your teacher loved it. -Just the opposite.
Very good everyone.
But let's stick to the script.
After all that.
It wasn't a good line, so I didn't mind.
I wasn't discouraged at all.
I realized that I could act even when there were no lines.
Behold, the crows fly home.
First one.
Then two.
Then three.
Then four.
That was all.
It was worth the effort. "Village Child A" was a hit.
Believe it or not.
People asked if I'd had lessons.
Teachers praised me...
Then something amazing happened.
Anyone home?
Coming.
And then the dynamite blew up right in my face!
Right in my face!
What?
Our Taeko?
Yes, but-- We need a girl to star in our college play.
As a service to the community, please let your daughter perform.
A star!
We'd rehearse Saturday afternoons.
We wouldn't take too long.
Well, but...
Of course we'd bring her straight home.
I'll be in a real play.
Not with a bunch of kids but with real grown-ups!
I'll be a star!
Oh, oh, oh, oh What a wonderful day Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Mother!
So?
So?
A nice boy from the university wants you in their drama.
You were so good in the school play.
And?
And?
He practically begged me!
Wow, that's great!
At least you're good at something.
She writes good essays too.
She's certainly better at that than she is at math.
That's right.
That's right.
I was the lead in "The Poor Sparrow" but no one came to see me.
You see, you see!
Are you going to do it?
This could lead to a career.
Join the Takarazuka Revue!
Start rehearsing now, it's perfect timing.
Acting is out.
Show business people are no good. "Show business"...
Don't exaggerate...
That's right.
It's...
I said no.
Dinner.
Father's so stubborn.
Why did you have to mention a career?
Can I bathe first?
Sure.
Or Takarazuka?
Or show business?
You know Dad...
Why did you say that, Nanako?
That's enough.
Poor boy, poor boy Don't you feel sorry for me?
We won't take much of her time.
I know, but...
I beg you.
She's rather shy...
The timid type...
Sorry you came so far for nothing.
Poor boy, poor boy Such a long way from home Poor boy Aoki's going to play the part instead.
I see.
She's boasting to everyone.
I see.
Today her mom met her at school to get her changed into a fancy dress.
A frilly thing out to here...
Taeko?
Don't tell anyone you got the first offer.
Because that would hurt Aoki very much.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Breaking through the waves Shooting through the clouds Where is it heading?
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island?
Where will it take us?
Something special waits for us Just over the horizon There'll be hard times There'll be sad times But we'll never lose heart We hate to cry, so let's laugh instead Let's go!
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!
Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!
Poor little Taeko.
I joined the drama group in high school.
I couldn't forget what had happened.
And then?
It was a lot of fun, acting and all... but it wasn't for me.
As for becoming a star... that was a joke.
But...
I guess dads are the same all over.
When I was in high school, I so wanted to live in Tokyo.
I even wrote to my cousin about universities there.
Did you really?
I gave up.
But it annoyed me to hear other guys bragging about life in Tokyo.
Not anymore, though.
I respect my dad.
He's an expert farmer.
But I know how you felt.
Mine's just a funny story.
No, it's the same, I understand. "But we'll never lose heart, we hate to cry, so let's laugh instead".
I also watched Hyokkori Pumpkin Island.
Really?
Machine Gun Dandy was so cool.
He was my hero!
Of course.
Those songs were full of encouragement.
What was that other one?
If today's no good You'll have tomorrow If tomorrow's no good You'll have the next day If that's no good There'll be another There's always a tomorrow What a weird song!
That song, about putting things off, Toshio took in a positive, affirmative way.
I liked his approach to life.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Yes.
Thank you for having me for so long.
Thank you, my dear.
Do you like it here?
Very much.
I feel so at home.
Glad to hear it.
I've lived here all my life.
Been to Tokyo just once.
For your sister's wedding.
You think it's better here?
Without a doubt.
Tokyo's packed with cars, buildings...
People shouldn't live like that.
This is a different world.
You really like it here, then?
Yes.
The nice surroundings, the kind people...
Taeko.
Why don't you come and live here?
With Toshio?
Since his brother moved to Tokyo, why don't you stay here and marry Toshio?
Granny!
Mother... you've gone too far!
Taeko's shocked.
Please think it over.
Don't pay any attention.
She's joking.
Joking, right, Granny?
No.
I'm serious.
Don't tell me you wouldn't like it.
It's not a matter of what we'd like...
Of course we'd love it.
But Taeko's a city person.
Of course.
But she loves it here.
She works so hard on the land, it's a joy to watch.
There'd be nothing better than her marrying Toshio.
You're being rude.
You're embarrassing her.
She's got a decent job in Tokyo.
Besides, she's older than him.
There are jobs in Yamagata too.
Please don't be angry.
Most of the young wives work these days, so...
What are you talking about?
She's only been here twice on vacation.
Suddenly bringing this up...
You're upsetting her.
So you're against it?
I didn't say that.
I said let's be realistic.
We don't even know how Toshio feels.
One look at him and it's obvious.
Don't dismiss it before we've asked her.
Taeko!
Let her be.
See what you did.
You can't rush these things.
I don't think I was wrong.
I'd never even thought of being a farmer's wife.
I was strangely moved, even imagining it might be possible.
If only I could've replied: "I'd love to", like in the movies.
But I couldn't.
Suddenly my love of the country, and my play-farming, seemed so phony.
Declaring my love for country life based on a ten-day vacation now felt embarrassing.
Then with no warning... everyone seeing right through me.
It was unbearable.
I ain't shaking hands with you.
That shirt he wore today... -What about it? -Tanaka's old shirt.
Don't tell anyone.
When it's his turn to feed the ducks, he takes the bread home.
Did you see his hands?
Glad he's not sitting next to me.
Poor Taeko.
Have him switch places.
He should sit with the boys.
Right, Taeko?
I don't mind.
You shouldn't talk like that.
You don't mind?
Don't be a goody-goody.
Don't you dare tell anyone what we said.
I'll beat you up!
Don't go!
What are you doing out here?
Nothing.
Taking a walk.
You're getting wet.
Quick, get in.
A little souvenir.
Some of Mom's pickles.
Please don't go back yet.
Why not?
Just drive... anywhere.
Something wrong?
I knew a boy named Abe.
He came from another school.
He sat next to me.
He once said, "I ain't shaking hands with you." His family was poor.
He never had any sports gear.
Always picking his nose or wiping it on his sleeve...
And if I complained or even dared frown at him, he'd threaten to hit me.
I hated it.
I longed for the end of the term, so we could change seats.
I hated holding hands in dance class, hated having to lend him my homework.
The girls gossiped and called him names.
But I wouldn't join in.
I thought it was terrible to talk behind his back.
But one day... he was transferred in the middle of the term.
The teacher made us all shake hands and say goodbye.
A feeling of disgust swept the room.
His hands were filthy.
Walking around, shaking hands with us, he looked so nervous.
Back at his own desk, only I was left.
When I held out my hand he said, "I ain't shaking hands with you." "I ain't shaking hands with you." I hated him the most.
He knew that.
That's why he didn't shake my hand.
Did something happen at the farmhouse?
Ever since I was little...
I just pretend to be nice.
Nothing's changed.
You're strange, today.
Not the usual you.
I don't know what happened, but...
It's nothing to do with that.
I'm sorry.
I just feel bad about what happened.
I think that boy was stupid.
Maybe he didn't shake your hand because he liked you.
No, he liked the class president.
He was always acting tough with me.
Hands in pockets, spitting, swearing, swaggering along, showing off.
Exactly.
I know how he feels.
When I was little, I used to tease the girl I liked.
That's not it.
He shook hands with everyone but me.
There's the problem.
Girls never understand how boys feel.
As if you know...
Let me guess, then...
He wasn't that tough.
He couldn't bully any boys.
He had no friends.
You sat next to him, an easy target.
He wanted you to think he was tough.
No way he wanted to shake hands with everyone.
He only acted tough around you.
MARGARET Don't be filthy!
I felt so guilty and so sorry for him that I began copying him.
Too late though, huh?
I couldn't take back the pain I caused him.
It's stopped raining.
Oh, yes.
The moon's out.
Sometimes at night you see raccoon dogs here.
Shall we go back?
They must be worried about me.
This'll be the talk of the town.
I'm sorry.
You've been so kind.
I wonder what happened at the house, though?
Please, for my sake, don't ask anyone.
Shall I play that music?
I began to think of my feelings for him, and of his feelings for me, for the very first time.
How was he able to sort out my mixed-up thoughts ?
How come I let him get so close?
Somehow he seemed older than me.
He was the one I wanted to shake hands with.
Just shake hands?
What was this feeling?
My mind raced as I sat beside him.
Have you got everything?
Yes, I'm fine.
We'll see you in the winter.
I'll do my farming homework.
What about skiing?
That just takes practice.
Consider what I said, Taeko.
What's that?
What?
That's our secret.
Something was strange yesterday.
Sorry.
Next time I'll be fine, I'll leave the ten-year-old me at home.
Wait for me!
Take care, Naoko.
Goodbye.

Okay.
A goldfish...
It's stuck.
That was weird.
Ow!
Is it dead?
It licked me...it's alive.
Sosuke, we're leaving!
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!
This wind feels strange...
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!
Did you find her?
What, captured by a human?
This is bad...very bad.
Are you dead?
You're alive!
Sosuke!
I'm going to be late!
Lisa!
I caught a goldfish.
A goldfish?
Down by the rocks.
I'm sorry, but you can't use weed killer here.
Heavens no!
This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.
As long as it's not weed killer.
Good day!
This is very bad.
What a creepy guy.
But don't you say that about strangers, Sosuke.
I won't.
Are you taking that to school?
Won't the teacher complain?
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
She's cute!
They're using the dry dock.
Here, eat this before we get there.
Maybe she's hungry.
Want some?
Hey, my cut is gone!
I'm going to call her Ponyo.
She's really special!
She can do magic.
She fixed my cut.
Want some ham?
Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!
That makes two of us.
Oh no...
Disgusting!
Hurry, Lisa!
Such filth!
Intolerable!
Good morning!
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.
I'll drop you here.
Okay.
Have fun.
See you.
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.
Could you get Noriko's wheelchair?
Good morning, Sosuke.
I'm busy, Yoshie.
Talk to you later.
My!
Hello, Sosuke.
Can't talk now, Toki.
Maybe the teacher will get mad.
I know!
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.
What if a cat comes?
Stay here, I'll be right back.
See you later.
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.
Okay, thanks.
Bye-bye.
Good morning, teacher.
Hello Sosuke.
How are you?
Sosuke!
Kumiko...
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.
Oh...
Let's play, Sosuke!
Not now.
I'm busy.
How come?
I told you, I'm busy.
You're no fun.
Yeah!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Kumiko...
What's that?
You're not supposed to bring stuff.
But these trees aren't on school grounds.
Show me.
Oh, a goldfish.
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
I want to see!
Promise not to tell?
I promise.
Isn't she cute?
It looks fat.
My goldfish is lots cuter.
It's Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.
I'll give you some more water.
Ponyo!
You scared me.
Why, how odd.
That was Sosuke's voice.
But he's supposed to be in school.
I must be hearing things.
Here I am, Yoshie.
I knew I heard your voice.
Do I have a secret?
Yes!
Bingo!
Okay, what color is my secret?
Red!
Red!
Good guess.
How'd you know?
Show us.
All right.
Oh, how pretty!
Very cute!
Her name is Ponyo.
She loves ham and she can do magic.
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.
I wonder if she'd fix our legs.
We could run around just like you.
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo first.
Can I take a look?
Sure, Toki.
Heavens, it has a face!
Put it back before it brings a tsunami!
You're so superstitious, Toki.
That's what the old stories say.
Fish like that are bad luck.
The tsunami!
It's here!
The tsunami is here!
What's wrong, Toki?
Just look at my clothes!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Come back here and apologize!
Don't worry, I'll protect you.
Sosuke.
Sosuke.
Ponyo!
Ponyo.
Sosuke.
Ponyo... loves... ...Sosuke!
I love you too.
Ponyo loves Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Listen, Sosuke.
Maybe it was fate.
It just can't be helped.
Ponyo was born in the sea.
She went back home, that's all.
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy is gone.
One lick?
Hurry, it's melting!
Not bad!
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.
He'll be disappointed if you're feeling down.
No more ocean today, okay?
Sosuke?
Time to come inside.
Do you think this bucket will help Ponyo find us?
There's only one way to find out.
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
Yes, I'm fine.
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.
Okay.
Here's Lisa.
Koichi?
Yes...
What?!
Can't you get out of it?
Fine...leave your wife and son up on the cliff!
I give up!
Why bother?
C'mon Sosuke, let's eat out!
I want to eat here.
There he is!
Turn off the lights, Lisa.
It's Sosuke!
He's a genius.
Only five years old.
Your wife must be upset.
He says he's sorry.
J...
JE...
JER...
JERK J...
JE...
JER...
JERK JERK!
JERK!!
JERK!!!
JERK!!!!
JERK!!!!!
He says he loves you!
Lots and lots!
J...
JE...
JER...
JERK JERK JERK JERK Wow, that's cool!
G...
GO...
GOO...
GOOD GOOD L...
GOOD LU...
GOOD LUC...
GOOD LUCK THANKS LOVE AND KISSES Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.
I promised Ponyo I'd take care of her.
I hope she isn't crying.
Okay, let's cheer up! “I'm happy as can be...” Ow!
Don't worry, Sosuke.
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.
Now let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!
This is all my fault.
Bringing you along to watch me was a mistake.
How often have I warned you about humans?
Their very breath is polluted.
Come, you must eat.
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?
I want ham!
Ham?!
What on earth have you been doing?
Answer me, Brunhilde!
My name's not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.
Ponyo?
Ponyo loves Sosuke.
I want to be human!
Human?
How could you love such disgusting creatures?
They rob the sea of life.
I was human myself...once.
I finally escaped that awful heritage.
I want hands!
I don't like this!
I want legs like Sosuke!
Of all the nonsense!
Look at me!
Hands and feet!
No...don't tell me you tasted human blood!
Wanna see Sosuke!
No!
His blood has deranged your DNA!
Revert. ..revert...
Go back...go back!
It's not working.
I need more power.
Let me out!
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!
Just like her mother...so strong.
She should remain innocent and pure forever.
I can't hold her for long.
I need her mother's help.
No!
My elixir is too strong for you!
Shoo!
Go away!
My crab shields were weakening.
I nearly upset Nature's balance.
I must stay calm.
When I think of meeting HER again...!
This batch should be ready.
No leaks down here.
This door is loose.
I'll fix it later.
If even one creature got in here...!
Superb!
I feel the ocean's power in my very DNA.
When this well is full, the Era of the Ocean will begin.
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Era!
This revolting era of Man will be over.
Better fix this door.
Teeth!
I'm going back to Sosuke!
A waterspout?
Captain, look there!
Tsunami!
Turn her into the waves!
What's that?
Captain!
Radio's out, the radar too!
A little girl?
She must be Sosuke's age!
Bye-bye.
See you tomorrow.
Thanks.
Take care.
Do you want to wait here for Lisa?
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Be careful out there.
Sorry, Sosuke.
The power's out.
The door wouldn't open, would it?
Was the school okay?
Go home, Lisa.
We'll be fine.
Are you sure?
Don't worry, we'll be just fine.
We're spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.
Wait for me, Sosuke.
Yoshie.
Why, Sosuke.
It's so dark, I didn't see you.
This is for you.
My, what is it?
One for you, Noriko.
Thank you.
Can't see a thing.
This is such foolishness!
I don't want to spend the night.
Oh good, the power's on.
It's a goldfish!
Maybe Sosuke's magic made the lights go on?
Extremely powerful...
Micro-typhoon...
Ships should exercise extreme caution...
This TV is useless.
Those idiots couldn't forecast their way out of a paper bag.
You should go home, Sosuke.
Your goldfish will bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.
Here's yours, Toki.
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?
Like this.
I know!
It's a grasshopper.
No, the Koganei Maru.
That's your father's ship.
Still looks like a grasshopper.
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye.
Don't let the wind blow you away!
Climb over.
The phones are out too.
The sea is puffed up!
Will the ships sink?
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.
I see fish, Lisa.
Seat belt!
You've got to turn back!
People are going to the shelters.
But there are people at the senior center!
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.
I've just got to get home.
You'd better go around the mountain.
Here we go, Sosuke.
No!
Stop!
Look out for that wave!
Here it comes!
Run for it, Lisa!
The fish are following us.
Seat belt, Sosuke!
Hold on tight!
That wave won't quit!
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.
Where?
The sea keeps rising.
Where did you see her?
Running on top of a fish.
A fish!?
Come on, Sosuke.
Hang on, Sosuke!
We're almost home.
A little girl!
Here, you'd better come with us.
Stay there, Sosuke.
Sosuke, do you know her?
Ponyo?
Yes, it's me!
It's you!
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!
I made it!
Now listen, children.
No matter how strange everything seems... ...we have to stay calm.
Now be good.
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.
Here Ponyo, you hold the light.
I'll bring you a towel.
C'mon, Ponyo!
It smells just like you!
Ouch!
Ponyo!
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.
Such pretty red hair!
But your clothes are dry...
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.
I like this!
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?
Help me with the light, Ponyo.
Coming!
Think we'll have water?
Sure!
Sure!
Water!
Water!
We have a tank outside.
What about the gas?
Presto!
All right!
All right!
It's propane.
Okay, take your seats.
Okay!
Over here, Ponyo.
Sit down, like this.
Put your stuff down.
You need your hands.
I have feet!
Wow!
What are you two doing?
Her feet are like hands.
There you go.
This is the best!
That hit the spot.
What shall we do now?
I want ham!
She's crazy about ham.
Then let's eat.
But first let's start the generator.
We need electricity to talk to Koichi.
Koichi is my father.
Is he a bad sorcerer?
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.
What about your father, Ponyo?
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.
I ran away.
What about your mother?
I love my mother!
She's really scary.
Sounds like Lisa.
Can you help me, Ponyo?
Maybe the fuel's too old?
Is it clogged?
Clogged.
It's clogged there.
Success!
All bright!
Wow, Ponyo!
Antenna!
Antenna!
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?
I can't see a single light.
So loud!
What's wrong?
Even the radio is out of whack.
This is JA4LL...JA4LL.
Come in, Koichi.
It's Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.
We're going to have dinner.
Ham!
Ready?
Careful, it's hot.
It's not ready yet.
It takes three minutes.
Close your eyes!
Not yet!
No peeking, Ponyo.
Okay, you can look now.
And...presto!
Ham!
Good for you, Ponyo.
Ponyo went to sleep.
Is her home far away?
I think it must be.
Look Sosuke.
The sea is calmer.
Because Ponyo's asleep?
Look over there!
It's moving.
Someone's up there.
People from the senior center?
It's gone.
That's the peak road.
Sosuke, stay there with Ponyo.
Maybe I could get through on the mountain road.
I'm going to the senior center.
I'll go too.
Stay here with Ponyo.
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.
I'm going with you!
Sosuke, our house is a lighthouse in the storm.
Everyone out there is depending on us.
Someone has to stay here.
Lots of things are happening that I don't understand.
But right now I'm worried about the people at the senior center.
Just knowing you're here will help me.
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.
Promise?
I promise.
You promised!
I love you, Sosuke.
I see the lights of the town!
Finally...
Now we can navigate.
I've never seen that town before.
Did the storm blow us to America?
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor...
Those are ships!
The sea is piled up into a mountain!
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?
We lost power!
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!
Aye-aye!
Something is coming!
A sea goddess!?
The engine!
We're saved!
The engine started again.
It was Her!
Protect us from harm...
Come on, come on.
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?
Good heavens. . .she's human!
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?
Stop!
This is unsafe!
Stop that at once!
I'm simply trying to save your sister.
She's here.
She answered my call!
Fujimoto...
You came, my beloved.
Such a beautiful ocean.
So full of magic, like my ancient Devonian sea.
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood... ...and plundered all of my elixir.
Ponyo...what a lovely name.
It's all my fault.
She's totally beyond my control.
It's complete chaos.
She doesn't understand what she's done.
Now she's human, and she's up there with her boyfriend!
If we don't stop her, the planet is doomed!
No!
The satellites are falling.
Earth's gravitational field...
Be still...
Sosuke...that is his name, yes?
You love your sister, don't you?
Listen, dear...what if Ponyo really became human?
Use the old magic.
If Sosuke's love is real, she'll lose her powers forever.
But if it's not, she'll turn to sea foam!
That's where we all came from, dear.
But he's only five!
Sleep well, little children.
Sosuke!
Sosuke!
Ow!
Good morning, Ponyo.
Morning, Sosuke.
We almost got flooded.
Where's Lisa?
She must be stuck someplace.
I wish we had a boat.
There's a boat!
We can't fit.
Can so.
Awesome!
The candle's bigger too.
We can fit.
This is cool.
Cool!
Grab that end.
Ready?
Ready!
She's seaworthy!
Awesome.
No leaks!
Now we fill the boiler.
The water goes in here.
It goes in the boiler.
It's like a rocket!
Everything's shipshape.
Shipshape...
Shipshape?
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Shipshape!
Is it hot?
Hot!
It's hot.
The candle's burning.
It's burning!
Hot hot hot!
It's hot.
Awesome!
We're shipshape, Sosuke!
This is great.
This is so much fun.
It's burning, Sosuke.
It's really hot.
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.
Okay, I'm the lookout.
There's a road.
That's the road Lisa took.
I don't see her.
You will.
She gave me her promise.
Ancient fish... from the Devonian age!
There's Bothriolepis.
That one is...
Dipnorhynchus.
Dipnorhynchus!
That one's really huge.
That's Devonynchus.
Devonynchus!
Ahoy!
A boat!
Ahoy!
They're calling us.
Ahoy!
Ow!
Pretty good, huh?
Now, Ponyo.
Hello.
That's a wonderful boat you have.
Why, you're Lisa's little boy.
He's not little, he's Sosuke.
This is Ponyo.
I was a fish before.
A fish?
Ponyo...that's a nice name.
Have you seen Lisa?
Lisa?
She's not with you?
She's at the center.
The senior center...?
This is my baby.
Oh my, what happened?
Is that for us?
Give me the cup, dear.
Thank you.
Let's try it.
It's delicious!
Lisa made it.
It's for the baby.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.
But this will help me make milk for him.
Lisa gave me her milk too.
Ponyo, may I have this soup?
Sure.
Thank you.
People from the town.
It's like a festival.
You there!
Do you need assistance?
Thanks, we're okay right now!
Then please follow us.
We're going to the hotel on the peak.
Okay!
Will do.
The whole town's here.
I hope everyone's all right.
Let's go, Ponyo.
Hold on a second.
Milk!
Oh my...
Milk!
She ate up all the ham.
This will help me make good milk.
Can you use another candle for your boat, Sosuke?
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.
Be careful!
Thank you both!
What is it, dear?
Don't cry.
Ponyo!
Sosuke!
Where's Lisa?
Isn't she with you?
I'm going to pick her up.
So she survived that wave?
Sosuke, take me with you!
Later, Kumiko.
I'm busy now.
Everyone from the center evacuated to the park.
Keep safe!
You can do it!
We'll send a boat for them later.
Good luck, captain!
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.
We're okay.
I have another one.
Ow!
It's still pretty hot.
Bye-bye.
Can you make this candle bigger?
All right.
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Good...it's shallow enough to walk.
A road!
It's shrinking!
Ponyo!
Ponyo, wake up!
Sosuke...
Don't scare me.
I thought you were turning into a fish.
Lisa's car!
Ponyo, that's her car!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Lisa!
Here's your boat.
Your eyes are wet.
Let's find Lisa.
You forgot your wrap!
Who needs it?
Look, it's a whale!
My knees don't hurt anymore!
What were we so afraid of?
Is this the Other Side?
Who cares?
It's wonderful.
Attention, please!
Gather round.
Coming!
Shall we?
It's so nice to run.
Meet you there!
The winner!
You're so fast, Kayo.
Quiet, everyone!
The moment of truth is at hand.
Sosuke and Ponyo are almost here.
It's so romantic.
Will love triumph?
I'm so excited!
Quiet!
Very soon, you will bear witness to a sacred trial of love.
Mr.
Fujimoto, you're not up to something, are you?
Nonsense, he's her father.
They'll be fine... if she doesn't wake up.
Now excuse me!
I'd like to believe him...
Where's Lisa gone to?
She's been talking with Ponyo's mother for ages.
I hope she's okay.
What are they talking about?
Let's find out.
Lisa!
Lisa!
We're all rooting for Sosuke and Ponyo!
Lisa!
You must be worried.
Sosuke will be just fine.
He's a strong little boy.
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.
Ponyo, it's a tunnel. “STOP” I've been here before.
Ponyo?
I don't like this place.
Don't let go of my hand.
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Ponyo!
Please don't die!
Ponyo!
Wake up, Ponyo!
Let her sleep.
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.
Lisa and the old ladies are waiting too.
Lisa?!
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.
Let's not wake her.
Sosuke!
Don't listen to him!
He tricked everyone into going with him.
Toki!
But he couldn't fool me!
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?
If the Moon comes any closer, we're finished!
Is that the best you can do?
Sosuke, come here!
Listen to me, Sosuke.
You're the planet's last hope.
Don't make me use force.
Ponyo!
Is this how you treat your father?
Ponyo!
Run, Sosuke!
You don't understand!
You can make it!
Jump!
Now what?
Lisa!
Sosuke!
Ponyo!
Look over there.
Where are we?
So, you are Sosuke.
Hello.
Are you Ponyo's mother?
Yes.
I want to thank you for bringing my daughter back to me.
Ponyo wanted to be like you, but she unleashed a terrible power.
To become human, she must be loved... ...for who she really is.
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?
Yes.
Your blood made her human...almost.
That's right!
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.
So that's why she changed!
Can you accept her as she is?
I'll always love Ponyo... ...whether she's a fish, a human... ...or in between.
Come, Ponyo.
Sosuke has promised to accept you as you are.
But first, you must give up your powers.
Can you do that?
Kiss this bubble when you return to land... ...and Ponyo will be a little girl.
Way to go, Ponyo!
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!
Now the planet is safe again.
Splendid, Sosuke!
Sosuke!
I'm grateful, Lisa.
Thank you, Gran Mamare.
There you are!
Are you all right?
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.
Don't bother, we'll walk.
It's all so exciting.
I believe this is yours.
Thanks.
I hope you'll forgive me...may I?
Take good care of her.
It's Koichi!
Koichi!
It's Lisa!
And there's Sosuke!
Look,Ponyo.
It's Koichi! {\an8}We made this movie Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, tiny little fish She's a little fish from the deep blue sea Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, she's a little girl She's a little girl with a round tummy Pitter-patter, hop-hop and jump Look, I have legs!

I'll never forget that summer.
I spent a week in the old house where my mother grew up- Planning & Screenplay by Hayao Miyazaki Produced by Toshio Suzuki Based on "The Borrowers" by Mary Norton Music by Cécile Corbel Almost there.
Feeling all right?
Yes.
Directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi THE SECRET WORLD OF ARRIETTY How many times I have told Haru, not to block the drive-way?
I'll be back in a sec.
Okay.
Haru!
You're blocking the driveway again.
Sho?
Where are you?
Don't touch!
These aren't for you.
Arrietty!
Yes?
You've been outside again!
And you might want to clean up this room, young lady.
This like my own li'l garden.
If you'd like to ask me, it looks like a great big mess.
Oh!
Look!
Is that a bay leaf?
Oh, Ah, I guess this means your birthday has come a little bit early.
Enough for a whole year.
But the bay tree's so far away.
What if a human bean saw you?...
Please be Carefull I'm always careful.
The world is full of dangerous creatures.
Your great uncle... ...was eaten by a toad.
I know.
Oh!
Don't this flowers just smell lovely?
So, they do.
With a bit of sugar, I could make some juice out of this.
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.
You was...
It'll be my first borrowing!
I've been practising night and day.
Father's home.
Hello father!
Father, I wanted to ask you about my...
I've seen the boy in the house.
What?
I saw him too.
No!
Arrietty...
Oh!
There's no way!He Couldn't have seen me.
I was safely hidden behind the bay leaf.
Father,are we going still borrowing this evening?
I won't hear of it.
It's too dangerous.
But he isn't even a boy!
It will be fine.
Huh father, I've been looking for it, this is so long.
Children can be more terrifying than grownups.
It'll be fine!
Young boys, need to go to bed early.
Oh, Thank you, Father!
But Pod...
This boy seems to be ill.
So you need no worry.
But Still...
It'll be alright Mother.
I'll be extra careful.
Our Arrietty's going to be 14 soon.
She's going to have to learn it get by the world When we are not here to help her.
Sometimes I feel like we're the last Borrowers left in the world. ...
And if is anything you need, just ask Haru to help you.
All right.
Haru, I'm depending on you.
Yes, madam.
Let's put out the screen.
Keep the bugs out.
Shouldn't you wear something a bit darker?
No! this will be alright!
Try and remember to borrow some tissue paper.
And even a cube of sugar, perhaps?
We could have it to sweeten juice or we serve it for the tea later.
But, only if you can.
We'll be back home, soon.
Please be careful.
Of Course!
Arrietty!
Bye!
Excuse Me Arrietty! would you Hold these for me please?
Yes Father!
Arrietty hold on tight!
Arrietty!
Ready?
Huh father it's all so big!
The world of human beings.
The sugar is in that pot.
Just wait here.
Father! you are great!
Now, let's get that tissue.
Father, look.
Then let that be Your first borrowing.
Be careful, it's sharp.
Yes!
Father, borrowing is such fun!
Look! down there.
Rats!
Steer clear of them.
They're trouble for us!
I am not afraid.
If they would come I can defend with this!
Sometimes it's best not to go looking for danger.
What is this place?
Human beings made it, to house all of their dolls.
This would be perfect for us!
I'm sure Mother would love that dresser over there.
These things aren't for borrowing.
Anything goes missing, they'd know right away.
So don't tell your mother.
Oh...
Don't need to be afraid of me.
Hey!
I saw you!
Out in the garden today.
My mother, she told me about you.
She saw little people here when she was young.
Was it you, she saw?
Was it?
I'm so sorry, Father.
The boy saw me, outside in the garden today.
I should've been a bit more careful.
I hope he didn't frighten you.
I think it's best, you don't tell mother. it will only worry her.
All right.
You don't always have to run.
Take the time to watch them first, then decide.
We're back.
Safe and sound.
Something wrong?
Things didn't go well this time.
This light gave out.
So we have to make our way back early.
Oh dear.
It meant we couldn't get your sugar.
Not to worry.
At least you're home safe and sound.
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your very first borrowing.
What a pretty pin.
Time for bed.
Well, Good night then.
She looks completely worn out.
Shall I make us some tea?
Sho!
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.
What!
A cube of sugar?
So, why was it?
It was left by the grating.
It's probably the same one I dropped last night.
What?
What do you mean, you dropped it?
Don't touch it Arrietty.
Is that understood?
It's a trap.
They're going to track us down and then they will catch us!
Aren't they?
We'll just have to stop borrowing for a while.
Maybe they already know where we are.
Pod, we'll have to move!
Oh!
This is such a lovely house.
Now we'll have to start again.
Oh!
Well, Should we see how things go?
Eat, soup's getting cold.
Ah!
Why did it have to be the sugar?
Thank you, Arrietty.
I wanted to hang the clothes out while the sun's up.
It's a pleasure.
I love doing laundry.
I'm going to take a little nap.
See You later.
All right. "You forgot something" So, You came back to me.
Hey please! don't go.
You have to leave us alone.
I just wanted to tell you that.
I want, to talk to you.
Human beings are dangerous.
If we're found, we have to move away.
My parents told me so.
So You have your family then?
I envy you.
You don't you have one?
I suppose I do.
But I've never seen my father.
My Mother's always working and barely has any time for me.
Is that so?
I would really like to know your name.
You can call me Sho.
Do you even have one?
Oh do you?
Of course I have a name!
It's Arrietty.
Arrietty. . .Arrietty...
That's so very pretty name.
Would it be posible for me to see you then?
Even if it's just for a moment?
Oh just a little peek.
Oh please?
What's going on here?
Ah! it's a crow!
You can't come in here!
Get Out!
What got into that bird?
I've never seen that behave like that before.
Perhaps it's time for their nesting season.
I need to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?
Master Sho, it's high time.
You should to,.. you should take some of your medicine now.
Thank you, Haru.
I..
I really feel fine.
Thanks.
Hmmm....
The nesting season, eh?
Have yourself a lovely long rest.
Father!
I told you to stay away.
I'm sorry.
I thought I should take care of myself.
Father he really didn't see me.
Your actions put your family in danger.
I won't say it again.
Understood?
Yes.
I think it's time to start looking.
For a new home.
Oh Pod... "You forgot something" Hello!
Got a package for you.
Thanks a lot for the drink.
It's so hot today.
Do you know of any good pest control companies around here?
Oh let's have a look!
Here's one. "Squeaky Clean Services.
Pest Control" Squeaky Clean Services?
I'll write it down.
You having problems with mice?
Maybe it's mice, Maybe it's something more interesting.
Between you and me, it's little people.
I've seen them myself.
Hmmm ...
I hear, a crow tried to fly into your room?
I hope it didn't scare you.
I'm fine aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it away.
I've never seen anything like...
A huge grey beast of the crow...
Excitement is the worst possible thing in the world for his heart.
Haru!
Sho came here for some peace and quiet.
If anything were to happen before the operation...
Of course madam.
Gracious!
I realize Sho's mother's work is terribly important to her.
But to go abroad on business and leave a sick child behind?
It's never easy for a young boy to be without his mother.
You shouldn't worry about it.
I don't mind.
I suppose the divorce was inevitable but why she can't be here when her only child needs her so?
But why can't she be here, when he needs her so?
Aunt Sadako, who made that little wooden house in my room?
Looks amazing.
Ah, You mean the dolls' house?
It belongs to your mother.
When she was a small child.
She had to leave it here years ago when she moved away.
It was Mom's?
My father had it made specially to order... ...As a place for all the little people to live in.
Litle ...
Father always said he wants so little people in our home.
He waited for years.
In the hope of seeing them again He always said that the house was a present for them.
I'm afraid they never did show themselves again.
Not in my father's lifetime, and regrettably, not in mine.
Master Sho, I don't suppose you saw any little people in your room?
Ummm...Unfortunately...not.
The dolls' house has been passed down from my father.
I'm sure your mother would be very happy for you to have it now.
Do.. do you mean that?
Yes.
Have you looked inside?
It's really quite beautiful!
Haru, would you be so kind to turn off the lights?
Madam.
This is the living room.
All the furnitures were hand-made by a real furniture maker.
Beautiful!
Don't you think?
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a study.
Wait untill tou see the next room.
That's my personal favourite.
Haru, yould you be so kind?
My Certainly!
I think it opens this way.
Wonderfull!
It is perfectly detailed and just like the real thing. even the oven works.
You could use it for baking.
Ah! it's Beautiful.
It is a pity Father's dream never came true.
And it's been so long...
Maybe the little people are gone now.
Mother, these same pictures have been here for years.
Can't we change them?
I truly love those pictures.
I wish that one day I'd get to see the real ocean.
Anyway, there's no point changing now.
Father's a bit late.
I hope he didn't get caught in that downpour.
It's father!
Sounds like he's at the back door.
Father!
Are you okay?
I've twisted my leg.
Luckily Spiller here, helped me.
Pod?
Oh no! you're hurt!
Hurry! bring him in!
Does it hurt?
No, it's not broken.
I'll be fine in no time.
Come in.
I'll get you some cold water.
Here's a towel, dry yourself.
You?
I knew it!
It's not just the three of us after all.
I got to go.
Please don't.
Stay with us.
Have some tea.
I can attend to your father.
And you get Spiller a cup of tea.
Of Course!
Oh!
Thank you, Spiller.
Father's so lucky you came along.
We're so in debt to you.
Spiller, have you seen other Borrowers?
You see, we thought we might be the only one that were left in the whole world.
I think this many.
Ah!
Then Cousin Lupy must be alright!
Is that a bow you have?
Can I look?
How you use this for borrowing?
Give that back Arrietty.
It's not a toy.
Give.
Got to go.
But... but...
We just about to eat something.
Would you like to join us?
You eat this?
Hmmm...
Whoa! cricket's leg!
Want some?
It's so good.
No thank you!
Get well.
I thank you again.
I'll see him out.
Did you go looking for a new home then?
After I tripped and fell in the woods.
Couldn't move untill Spiller found me.
You were lucky.
Spiller lives in the land on the otherside of river really well.
He's told me, he knows about few places where we could look to build a new home.
That's good, I suppose.
I'm not looking forward sleeping rough I wonder if we find anything as nice as this though.
I'm glad there are more like us.
It's make me feel better.
Oh Spiller!
Do you never have been with your family?
Family?
No, just me.
All right.
Please come.
Visit us again.
My mother makes really amazing stew.
Okay Haru?
Arrietty, your stitches need to be neater.
You have to start over.
What what is this big bag for? why we'll need it?
I think I go and see how father is.
Father, may I come in?
How's your leg?
Ah, I'll be walking very soon.
Father?
Are we going to move away?
The human beings have seen us.
We have no choice but to move.
I don't think that every human being is dangerous.
Arrietty...
Long before you were born, there were two other families living in this house.
One of them went missing.
They just disappeared.
The other one moved away.
They were seen by human beings.
No matter what happens, this family must survive.
Father.
Oh My...What happened?
Earthquake!
Mother!
It won't open.
The frame's buckled.
Uh...not the wall!
Homily!
Homily!
I always dreamed of having a kitchen like this.
Gather only the things we need.
We won't be able to carry all that.
And Homily, take nothing from the doll house.
Please.
I'll go ahead and make sure it's safe.
Stay here with your mother.
Yes.
You finally came back.
So, what do you think of the new kitchen?
Our house is in really a big mess.
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye today.
Can I look at you?
Beautiful!
We are going to move away from here.
We have been seen by human beings.
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.
Oh...
Borrowers...?
We borrow things from human beings.
We take things we need. and they won't miss.
Soap, cookies, sugar, Electricity and gas, too.
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.
And no body seen them?
Never?
Probably.
I think this is all my fault.
Ah!
Niya!...
Niya! don't be like that.
Be nice to her.
Arrietty, are there other little people like you living hidden away in the house?
No, it's just my father, mother and I.
What about elsewhere?
I'm sure there's more.
But I've only met one so far.
Oh.
So, one day you might be the only one left.
Every year you get less and less.
That would mean you're a doomed species.
That's not true!
There's lots more of us.
Spiller said so!
Spiller?
He's one of us.
And Spiller says there are many more of us out there.
Do you have any idea, how many people there are living in the world? 6.7 billion.
Six point seven billion...?
And how many of you?
I don't know.
There's probably just a few of you left.
Before my mother told me, I didn't know borrowers even existed.
There are so many rare species, thay have already died out.
I've only read about them in my school books, though.
So many beautiful creatures... ... have ended up dying out as the environment changes.
It's...
It's sad, but may be that's what the fate has stored for the borrowers.
Fate, you say?
You're the ones who changed things. and we are the ones who have to move away.
Fathe said that we must survive.
By own means.
So we're moving away, even though it's dangerous.
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!
But we will survive this.
And we will not just simply die out.
I'm sorry.
You're right of course.
In fact I'm the one who's going to die out.
What?
It's my heart.
They're going to operate on it next week, but it's hopeless.
Your heart...?
I've been sick since I was a little child.
I could never play with other kids.
When I saw you, I wanted to protect you, but I failed.
I can't even do that.
I hope that you have forgive me.
You are in this really that bad?
What on the earth is this doing in here?
Oh! the kitchen from the dolls' house!
I found you!
What is it?
My mother!
I heard her voice.
This really is a great kitchen.
And you're not the only one little here, I bet.
I have to go.
Help!
Let me out!
Help me!
The ceiling's been moved.
Hello, Paste Control.
Hello?
Squeaky Clean Services?
Yeah that's us.
Can you make an urgent house call?
Yeah sure.
We have something small in the house, but not mice.
No! mice?
I don't want them killed.
You need trapping services ?
Yes.
I want you to trap them.
Sho!
Sho!
Sho!
Sho!
Arrietty!
My mother's gone!
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human being got her!
Mother...
I'll help you to find her.
Someone's locked the door.
Let's try the room next door.
It won't budge.
Wait!
Here's a way in.
Amazing!
No, that's not it.
Farther down you will see a dirt track.
You turn in there. - Before the bridge?
No, no, after it!
Haru's opened this.
Then Haru must've taken mother someplace.
Are you alright?
Oh dear... dear...
What's taking them so long?
Mother!
Where are you?
But I locked the...
Locked?
Can I have some hot milk please?
Yes!
Of course!
Of course!
Just a moment.
Thanks, so much.
So hungry.
Can I have any cookies?
Mother!
Mother!
Mother?
Arrietty!
Here! here I am!
I'm here mother!
Arrietty!
Oh! at last!
They finally found the right road.
Uh!...
Another human being!
Mother!
It's okay.
Pardon madam, we'd like to take a look around the house first, if It's so worthwhile.
Take your time.
Now who could this be?
Haru?
Haru!
Madam!
What are they doing here?
My madam!
The little people here!
Little people?
Yes!
Little people who steal.
It's true! really!
They steal things from all over the house.
That's why so much was going missing.
Haru, what's got into you?
All these I might thought. it was my imagination.
Well, it wasn't.
You certainly didn't need to call in paste control.
We better hurry.
The house is full of them!
You'll believe me when you see this.
This is their nest.
Nest?
It looks like a pile of old junk to me.
Huh?
What?
What happened?
I swear I saw it.
I swear!
Haru, I'm sending paste controls away.
No, wait just a minute.
The dolls' house!
Master Sho?
May we come in?
Of course!
Hard to believe.
They've even stolen the little kitchen.
You'll see, it's gone.
Not gone!
This kitchen always looks so nice.
Please, please, wait madam.
I've caught one in a jar.
That's strange!
I wonder what's steepling Haru.
Hmm?
What wonderful fresh herbs.
Ah!
Someone has been making tea!
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.
Yes, there are.
So Haru really did see them.
Though she accused them of stealing.
They're not stealing at all!
They're Borrowers.
Sorry?
I mean, I wish I could see them.
I'm sure, they're here somewhere.
I think so too.
Madam!
Oh Excuse me, madam!
Is there any place you'd like us to start?
Oh, Are you all right?
It got out.
I had it right in here!
It's not my imagination.
There are little people!
Next time I swear I'll get them!
How far is it to where we're meeting Spiller?
It's just the end of this woods.
Then we head down the river.
I'm so exhausted.
I really don't think I can make it that far.
Let's move.
I can't do it...
Better eat something now.
We'll likely to be walking through till sunrise.
I'm sorry.
We had to leave our lovely house beacuse of my stupid selfishness.
That's in the past.
We'll make another lovely home, with the three of us together.
I'm going outside for some air.
Don't stray too far.
It's Niya!
Niya...
Niya...
Just a little further.
Spiller!
That's everything.
Now let's get moving.
Okay.
Mother, you allright?
Arrietty!
Sho!
Arrietty...
We're just about to leave.
I'm glad I got here in time.
Niya showed me the way.
Thank you.
Look after yourself.
I...
I brought you this.
I'd very happy, if you could accept it this time.
Oh!
Thank you.
I must go now.
When's your operation?
In two days.
I'll be okay.
It's you, who gave me the courage to live.
It will bring you luck.
Thanks.
Thank You for having protected me.
Arrietty...
You take care of yourself.
Goodbye.
Arrietty, you're in my heart now and for always.
I'll never forget you, ever.
I'm fourteen years old, I am pretty.
I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady.
I live under the kitchen floor.
Right here, not so far from you Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel blue In my dreams oh I wish I could Feel my hair blowing in the wind See the sky in the summer rain Pick a flower from the garden for you Beyond the lane there's another world Butterflies floating in the air Is there someone out there for me?
And so life goes on day after day With knick-knacks on the floor, nooks and crannies I live in a tiny world, I live in a tiny world.
But out there someone waits for me I wish I had someone to watch over me In my dreams oh I wish I could Feel my hair blowing in the wind See the sky in the summer rain Pick a flower from the garden for you Now I know there's another world Butterflies floating in the air There is someone out there for me Feel my hair blowing in the wind See the sky in the summer rain Pick a flower from the garden for you Now I know there's another world Butterflies floating in the air There is someone out there for me A Studio Ghibli Film THE END
In ancient times, the land lay covered in forests, where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods.
PRINCESS MONONOKE Yakul!
Ashitaka!
The wise woman wants everybody back to the village at once.
We just came from Ji-san.
Ji-san?
Yes, in the forest.
Something's wrong.
The birds have gone.
The animals too.
I'll go check with Ji-san.
You three hurry back home.
Something's there.
Ji-san, did you see it too?
I did.
It isn't human.
The wise woman's calling everybody back to the village.
There.
Look.
It's some kind of demon!
A demon?
Run, Yakul!
It's headed for the village.
I've got to stop it.
Ashitaka!
That thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!
Yakul!
Calm your fury, O mighty Lord!
Whatever you may be, god or demon, please leave us in peace!
The monster!
Come on!
Go back!
Leave our village alone!
Stop!
Please!
Get up!
He killed it!
Ashitaka!
Fetch the wise woman!
Don't put the fire out yet.
Ashitaka!
Kaya, don't touch it.
This wound is evil.
Ashitaka is hurt!
Where is the wise woman?
You must keep away from him, all of you.
Everyone, stay back.
What shall we do?
Take this and pour it over his wound, child, slowly.
All right.
O nameless god of rage and hate, I bow before you.
Where you have fallen we will raise a mound and perform rites.
Pass on in peace and bear us no hatred.
Disgusting little creatures, soon all of you will feel my hate and suffer as I have suffered.
I'm afraid this is very bad.
The stones tell me the boar god came from far to the west.
He had some kind of poison inside him, driving him mad, a poisonous hatred that consumed his heart and flesh... and turned him into a demon monster.
Prince Ashitaka?
Yes?
Show everyone your right arm.
Hii-sama!
My prince, are you prepared to learn what fate the stones have foretold you?
Yes, I was prepared the very moment that I let my arrow fly.
The infection will spread, cause you great pain and kill you.
Is there no way we can stop it?
The prince got that wound by defending our village and saving our lives!
Do we just sit here and watch him die?
You cannot alter your fate, my prince.
However, you can rise to meet it, if you choose.
Look at this.
This iron ball was found in the boar's body.
It shattered his bones and burned its way deep inside him.
This is what turned him into a demon.
There is evil at work in the land to the west, Prince Ashitaka.
It's your fate to go there and see what you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.
You may find a way to lift the curse.
You understand?
Yes.
We are the last of the Emishi.
It's 500 years since the emperor destroyed our tribe... and drove the remnants of our people to the east.
Some managed to survive here for all these years, but our tribe's blood has grown thinner and weaker with each generation.
Now our last prince must cut his hair and leave us, never to return?
Sometimes I think the gods are laughing at us.
Our laws forbid us from watching you go, Ashitaka.
Farewell.
Ashitaka!
Kaya, what are you doing here?
You know it's forbidden.
Do you think I care about that?
I came to give you this so you won't forget your little sister.
Your crystal dagger.
Kaya, I can't take this.
Please, keep it with you, brother, to protect you.
Please, I want you to have it, so you won't... forget.
Kaya, you know I could never forget you.
A battle?
Move in!
Look!
Up there, on the hill!
His head is mine!
Stop!
My arm!
What's happening to me?
Hurry!
Stop him before he gets away!
Let me pass!
I'm warning you!
A demon.
The mark is getting bigger.
Are you selling soup or donkey piss?
There he is now.
Will this be enough?
What are you trying to pull?
This isn't money.
Give me back my rice, you little thief.
Excuse me, but might I inspect that?
But this is a lump of pure gold, you silly woman!
If it's money you want, I'll pay for the rice and take this nugget off your hands.
My good people, is there a money changer who could tell us how much this is worth?
No?
All right.
Now, I'm just a monk, but I'd say three bags of rice at least.
That's right, maybe even more.
Hey, wait a minute.
Give me my gold!
Hey!
You can't just rush off now.
Don't you even think of thanking me.
It was my pleasure.
In fact, I should be thanking you, really.
You see, I was caught in that battle.
I saw what you did to those samurai.
You fight like a demon.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I see you noticed we're being followed.
That's what we get for waving gold.
They'll wait till we're asleep, then slit our throats.
What to you say we give 'em a little demonstration of how fast we can run?
So the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
I followed its trail westward through the mountains, but then-- You lost it.
That's life.
See this place here?
When I came here last, a few years back, this was a lovely little village.
But then there must have been a flood or a landslide.
Everybody's dead.
These days, there are angry ghosts all around us, dead from wars, sickness, starvation.
And nobody cares.
So you say you're under a curse?
So what?
So's the whole damn world.
Ah, this is good!
I was wrong to fight in that village.
Two men are dead because of me.
Samurai thugs.
You win some, you lose some.
Hand me your bowl.
My point is, everybody dies.
Some now, some later.
Beautiful bowl.
I've seen one other like it.
Have you ever heard of the Emishi people?
They're said to ride red elks.
They also use stone arrowheads just like you.
Of course, they were all wiped out 500 years ago.
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone where you're from.
Anyway, I've got much bigger fish to fry.
Have you ever come across anything like this before?
Never have.
It was inside the giant boar.
I'm sure it was that ball that killed him.
There's a place high in the mountains far to the west of here.
It's where the Forest Spirit dwells, and it's very dangerous for humans.
To enter there is certain death.
The Forest Spirit?
I've been told the beasts there are all giants, just as they were in the dawn of time.
See ya there, my friend.
The sooner we get this rice home, the sooner we eat.
Let's move!
Coming this way!
Wolves!
Don't let the oxen panic!
Stay calm!
Take up your positions!
Keep your powder dry.
Make sure you wait for them to come within range!
Ready!
And fire!
Second round!
Fire!
That was it?
They weren't so big.
They're just pups.
Wait till you see their mother.
It's Moro!
Come on.
We killed her!
You forget she is a god.
It will take more than that.
She certainly did some damage.
We move out now.
What about the men she pushed over the cliff?
They're dead.
Let's get the living home.
He's still breathing.
Hang on.
My name is Ashitaka!
I have travelled far from lands to the east.
Are you ancient gods, and have I come to the realm of the Forest Spirit?
Go away.
A kodama!
I never thought I'd see one of them here.
Easy there.
You don't want to make your injuries worse, do you?
He's a tree spirit.
He brings good luck.
It's a sign this forest is healthy.
But they'll lead their lord and master right to us.
Who do you mean?
Those wolves I just saw?
No, I mean a real monster, like a huge enormous deer.
Where did it go?
If Yakul's not afraid, then we have nothing to worry about here.
Would you be kind enough to grant us passage through your forest, little one?
Sir, I really think we should turn around now.
No humans have ever made it through these woods alive.
There's a lovely trail back across the river.
The current's too swift for us to get across, and your friend's injuries are very bad.
Hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
Please, sir, I'm really pretty sure they're not trying to help us get home.
My God!
There's thousands of them.
Look at that.
That must be their mother, a fine old tree.
The tracks of those wolves and the girl with them.
This place must be where the four of them live.
Sir, I think we took a wrong turn.
This is a place for gods and demons.
I think we're safe.
We'll rest a bit.
More tracks?
Whatever made these made them recently.
Sir!
What's going on?
What just happened there?
You went white as a sheet all of a sudden.
Here.
Did you see anything just then?
Like what?
Forget it.
Hang on just a little longer.
You're almost home.
Thank you.
It's gone, That's strange.
Suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.
My arm!
It doesn't hurt!
It's healed!
No, it's still broken.
Sir, you were right.
We made it back home just like you said!
It's a fortress.
It's Lady Eboshi's Irontown.
We make iron here from the ore in the sand.
Hey!
Hey!
Someone's come out of the woods.
Is it the Wolf Girl?
Look!
It's me!
Kohroku, the ox driver!
It's Kohroku!
He's alive!
Kohroku's alive!
It's true!
Kohroku's still alive!
Let's go see!
I'm trying to tally these accounts here, so shut up!
Haven't you heard?
Kohroku's come back from the dead!
What?
This is unbelievable.
Where are the others, Kohroku?
Yes, is my son with you?
I'm afraid we're the only ones who made it.
It's never the guards that die.
Stand aside.
That man in the weird costume, sir?
Who do you think it could be?
He's obviously an outsider.
This stranger saved our lives.
He carried the rifleman all the way back here.
You should be grateful to him.
Hey, watch the arm.
Sir.
Hold it right there.
I'm very grateful for you bringing these men back to us, stranger, but something doesn't smell right.
You got back almost as fast as we did and through the forbidden forest with two badly injured men and you want me to believe-- Kohroku!
You're alive!
Toki!
That's just great!
How are you gonna drive the ox now, all banged up and mangled?
But...
You scared me half to death.
I wish the wolves had eaten you.
Then maybe I could have found a real husband!
Sweetness, can we discuss this later?
Toki, save your sweet nothings for some other time.
And as for you, Gonza, a fine captain of the guard you are, always strutting and throwing your weight around once the danger's over.
You never do a lick of work around here.
That's unfair and untrue.
Thanks, stranger.
My husband's an idiot, but I'm glad he's safe and sound.
Oh, good.
I was starting to think I'd done something wrong by bringing him back home.
Say, why don't you take the mask off?
I bet you're really handsome.
Gonza?
Bring the stranger to me later.
I would like to thank him personally.
Kohroku.
I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.
Milady, you really shouldn't tell him things like that.
If you're too nice to him, he'll walk all over you.
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki.
I was responsible.
I should never have let it happen.
That's all right.
Milady, if you hadn't been there, the wolves would have eaten everyone.
So true!
No mistake!
Get some rest, traveller.
I will see you this evening.
Hey!
You're not handsome, you're gorgeous!
Here!
You know, they had to fight off wolves to get this rice through.
Just dish it out!
There he is!
Where is he?
Toki was right.
He is handsome.
But he's so young!
That never stopped you before.
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today.
Yeah, there's lots of gorgeous men in here, honey!
I've seen cattle that looked better.
Listen, stranger, come over to our place?
You don't want to stay in this old barn.
Look, woman!
We risked our lives to bring you the rice, so watch your mouth.
And who made the iron that paid for that rice?
Tell me that.
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows while you pigs are in bed.
Actually, if it's not too much trouble, I would like to see where you work.
You would?
We'll have to work in make-up tonight.
Lend me your lipstick.
Don't forget now.
We'll be waiting for you.
It's best not to pay them any mind, you know.
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.
They say that happy women make a happy village.
Happy?
Ha!
Those kind of women workin' here?
Women like that--It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.
Lady Eboshi goes around buying the contract of every brothel girl she can find.
Milady has a kind heart, that's all.
You got rice on your chin, old man.
It's true.
Everything here has turned upside-down since she showed up.
That's right.
She's not even afraid of the gods, that woman.
You should have seen the way she dealt with Nago.
Am I right?
Who's Nago? "Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.
He used to rule this whole forest.
We couldn't even get near the mountains with him around.
Nothing to do but sit around on our backsides for months.
See, the iron in the sand under this town had all been dug out.
Then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain, but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.
Before we could dig for the iron, we had to clear away the forest, and that's what made the boar angry.
He's feeling no pain.
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along with her warriors and her rifles.
Young man, what's wrong?
Is something hurting your arm?
No, I was just thinking about the boar god.
I was thinking how he must have died filled with hate.
Forgive me for keeping you waiting, stranger.
That's good iron.
We were running behind with tomorrow's shipment.
Let's have a rest.
You may tell the others.
Yes, ma'am.
Some think you're a spy for the Wolf Girl or for Lord Asano and his samurai.
There are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron.
Why are you here, if you don't mind my asking?
I believe you'll recognize this.
It shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster.
I fought with him, and for that I was cursed with this mark on my arm, and soon it will kill me.
Where is it you come from?
I've never seen a red elk like that before.
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.
Answer milady's question or I'll cut you in half!
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?
To see with eyes unclouded by hate. "Eyes unclouded"?
That explains it.
Come.
I'll show you all my secrets.
Is that wise, milady?
Gonza, take over for me.
This is my garden.
None of the townspeople dare to come here.
Follow me if you wish to learn my secret.
Good evening.
We've only just finished it, milady.
It's still too heavy.
Perhaps if you didn't hold it so delicately?
Milady, if we make them any lighter, they'll fall apart.
They're not for me.
They're for the other women here.
That'll be something to see.
This is the latest rifle that I've asked these people to design.
The ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
These will kill forest monsters and pierce the thickest samurai armour.
You better watch out there, young man.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.
I'm sorry to have to push you all so hard.
I'll have wine sent down later.
That'll be nice.
First you transform the boar into a demon.
Now you're making even deadlier weapons!
How much more hatred and pain do you think we need?
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar, and I'm sorry that you suffer.
I truly am.
That brainless pig.
I'm the one he should have put a curse on, not you.
Does that right hand of yours wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?
If it would lift the curse, I'd let it tear you apart, but even that wouldn't end the killing now, would it?
No, it wouldn't.
It would have to kill all of us to be at peace.
Milady, Osa has something to say.
Forgive me, milady.
You must not make light of the boy's strength.
Young man, like you, I know what rage feels like... and grief and helplessness.
But you must not take your revenge on Lady Eboshi.
She is the only one who saw us as human beings.
We are lepers.
The world hates and fears us, but she took us in and washed our rotting flesh and bandaged us.
Osa?
Life is suffering.
It is hard.
The world is cursed, but still, you find reasons to keep living.
I'm sorry.
I'm making no sense.
They just keep coming back.
Every night they're out there planting trees, trying to turn the mountain into a forest again.
Stay here.
Help me kill the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka.
You would do that?
Kill the very heart of the forest?
Without that ancient god, the animals here would be nothing but dumb beasts once more.
When the forest has been cleared and the wolves wiped out, this desolate place will be the richest land in the world, and Princess Mononoke will become human.
Princess Mononoke?
Princess of the spirits of ghouls, beasts and ancient gods.
The wolf stole her soul, and now she lives to kill me.
The legends say the blood of the Great Forest's Spirit can heal anything.
Perhaps it could cure my poor lepers.
Might even be able to lift your curse.
Milady!
How does the action feel to you?
Smooth as silk, the perfect thing for ruling the world.
It's still too heavy for the girls.
All right.
Well, look who's here.
Evening.
All right if I work the bellows for a while?
Well, I guess so.
Excuse me.
May I try it?
It's okay.
Might as well let him try.
When you get tired, I'll take over for you.
Well, that won't be long.
Better keep that kimono shut tight, girl.
I'm impressed, but you'll never keep that pace up.
It's hard work, isn't it?
You bet, and our shifts are four days long.
You must lead hard lives here.
Yeah, I suppose.
But it sure beats working a brothel in the city?
Here we get to eat as much as we want, and the men don't bother us!
I see.
No!
But you can't leave tomorrow.
Can't you stay a little longer?
You can stay and work here.
Thanks, but there's someone I have to find out there in the forest.
She's here.
The wolves are coming.
Stop!
Wait!
I don't want to fight you.
I'm a friend.
Hurry!
She's after Lady Eboshi!
Somebody cut her off!
Keep stoking those fires!
Riflemen to the stockade.
We've got her right where we want her.
A weapon for every man!
Everyone defends Irontown!
Toki, she's on the roof.
Now, don't get excited.
Keep those bellows working.
Whatever happens, we can't let those fires go out.
Is she alone?
Yes.
We have her cornered.
You know she means to kill you this time.
We'll see about that.
Come on.
Can you hear me, Princess of Beasts?
If it's me you want, here I am.
If you seek revenge for all the animals we've killed, well, there are two women down here whom I'd like you to meet.
They want revenge for husbands killed by your wolves.
Come on out, you little witch!
My husband's dead because of you!
There she is!
Everybody out of the way!
Riflemen, get ready to fire!
It's a trap.
No!
Wait!
Princess of the wolf gods!
Don't go down there!
Go back to the forest!
Don't throw your life away!
Shall I stop him?
Leave him be.
Let him do what he likes.
She's down!
We got her!
Stay back.
Cut off a wolf's head, and it still has the power to bite.
Take aim where she falls.
Right.
Open fire.
Stay back!
Wake up.
No!
Skin her!
Kill her, milady!
Kill her!
Kill her!
Are you all right, sir?
Can I help you?
Get away from me!
Begone!
Traitor!
You're a spy for the wolves, aren't you?
Stay back!
Step aside.
What do you think you're doing, boy?
The girl's life is now mine.
I'm sure she'll make a lovely wife for you.
There's a demon inside of you.
It's inside both of you.
Look, everyone!
This is what hatred looks like.
This is what it does when it catches hold of you.
It's eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me!
Fear and anger only make it grow faster.
I'm getting a little bored of this curse of yours, Ashitaka.
Let me just cut the damn thing off!
Lady Eboshi!
Someone come here and take her from me.
Milady!
Don't worry.
She's just stunned.
She'll be all right.
As for me, I'm leaving, and I'm taking the Wolf Girl!
No, you're not!
Nobody treats my Lady Eboshi like that!
Move and I fire!
Kiyo, what are you doing?
How can he still be walking?
Is she all right?
Yes, milady's safe, sir.
Someone bring me my gun!
Riflemen to the square now, on the double!
They're not getting out of here alive!
Toki, come here.
What?
What's happened?
Sir, I can't let you pass.
The gate's been ordered shut.
It can't be opened.
Turn back, please.
We're grateful.
You brought those men back to us.
We don't want to hurt you.
Please!
I walked in through this gate this morning.
Now I'm going to leave the same way.
Don't be a fool.
It takes ten men to open this gate.
Stop it!
You'll kill yourself.
It's opening.
Out of the way!
The wolves are attacking!
Flint!
She's all right!
Your princess is safe with me!
Stay and I will bring her!
Come on, Yakul.
You have my thanks.
Good luck, stranger.
Stop it!
Leave him!
He's mine!
His own people shot him.
He's dying.
Why did you stop me from killing her?
Tell me while you're still alive.
I didn't want them to kill you.
That's why.
I'm not afraid to die.
I'd do anything to get you humans out of my forest.
I knew that from the first moment I saw you.
And I'm not afraid of you!
I should kill you for saving her!
That woman is evil.
There's no one who can stop me from killing her.
No.
Live.
That's enough!
I'm not listening to you anymore!
You're beautiful.
What is it, San?
Want me to crunch his face off?
The ape tribe.
Apes, how dare you show such disrespect to the wolf clan.
This is our forest.
The human, give him to us.
Give us the human and go.
You go before my fangs find you.
We will not go.
We will eat the human.
We will eat the human.
Yes, let us eat the man creature.
Are you crazy?
Just what happened to make the ape tribe change this way?
Since when do apes eat the flesh of a man?
If we eat the human, we will steal his strength, and we will drive the other humans away.
Give us the man creature.
Stop this.
You know you can't possess the humans' strength by eating them.
All that'll do is make you into something else, something even worse than human.
We plant trees.
Humans tear them up.
The forest does not come back.
If we kill the humans, we will save the forest.
You mustn't give up.
We'll find a way.
The Forest Spirit is with us.
Keep planting trees and someday we'll beat them.
The Forest Spirit will not fight.
We will all die.
Wolf Girl does not care.
She is human.
Enough!
I'll bite your head off, you chattering ape.
Stop!
Don't worry about them.
It's all right.
You two go on ahead now.
I'll stay here and deal with the human.
What about the elk?
Can we eat him?
No, you may not.
Go home!
Come over here.
Don't worry.
I'm a friend.
Don't be shy.
I won't hurt you.
I need you to help me carry him.
You're very wise.
You know better than to set foot on this island, huh?
I smell like a human.
You can go wherever you want to.
You're free now.
There he is.
Come and see.
Hurry.
It's the Nightwalker.
Quick, you idiots.
He's the reason we've been sitting around in these stinking animal skins, you know.
But sir, we can't.
It's a sin to look at it.
And you call yourself the greatest hunter in the West.
Look.
We've got a letter of pardon from the emperor, forgiving us for cutting off the head of the Great Forest Spirit.
The legends tell us that when day becomes night, the Forest Spirit turns into the Nightwalker, and at sunrise, it changes back.
Look!
See there?
It's happening.
Take a look, Master Jigo.
What is it?
Over there.
Look.
There must be hundreds of them.
Those boars are not from this region.
They must've been traveling for months to get here.
That one's Okkoto!
Can't be.
They say he died 100 years ago.
It's him, all right.
I know those old tusks.
And it looks like he brought along his whole tribe.
He's seen us!
Let's get out of here!
Come on, you cowards!
Move!
Quickly!
The bullet wound's gone.
Yakul.
You're awake.
You should thank Yakul.
He hasn't left your side this whole time.
How'd you know his name's Yakul?
He told me, and he told me about you-- about your village, your people and your forest.
The Forest Spirit brought you back to life again.
He wants you to live.
I had the strangest dream.
There was a golden creature.
Eat this.
Chew.
We are here to kill the humans and save the forest.
Why are there humans here, Moro?
Humans are everywhere these days.
Go back to your own mountain.
Kill them there.
The girl is San, my daughter.
We will kill them here.
We will save this forest.
What is that other human doing here?
He was shot, and then the Great Spirit healed his wound.
This man is not our enemy!
The Forest Spirit saved him?
Saved the life of that loathsome runt?
Why didn't he save Nago?
Is he not the guardian of the forest?
Why?
The Forest Spirit gives life and takes life away.
Life and death are his alone, or have you boars forgotten that?
You lie!
You must have begged the Forest Spirit to spare his life!
But you did not beg for Nago, did you?
Nago was afraid to die.
Now I, too, carry within my breast a poisoned human bullet.
Nago fled, and the darkness took him.
I remain and contemplate my death.
Mother!
Please ask the Forest Spirit to save you.
I have lived long enough, San.
Soon the Forest Spirit will let me rest forever.
All these years you defended the Forest Spirit!
He must save you!
You are not fooling us.
Nago was beautiful and strong.
He would not have run from anything.
You wolves must have eaten him!
Quiet!
Watch what you say, you filthy pig!
Gods of the mountain, please listen to me.
Nago died far from here, and I was the one who killed him.
He had become some kind of demon.
One day he attacked our village.
If you want proof, look at my hand where he touched me.
I came here to beg the Forest Spirit to lift Nago's curse from me.
He healed the bullet wound in my side, but the demon mark remains.
First it will tear my soul apart, and then it will kill me.
Okkoto, finally, a boar who will listen to reason.
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!
Please, you mustn't eat him.
You are Moro's human child, aren't you?
I have heard of you.
You're blind.
Stand back.
I will not eat him.
It's all right, San.
My Lord Okkoto, what I said about Nago's death was the truth.
I believe you, and I thank you for it, young one.
I am only grieved and ashamed that a demon has come from our tribe.
O mighty Lord, is there a way to lift Nago's curse from me?
Leave this forest... for the next time we meet I will have to kill you.
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.
Look on my tribe, Moro.
We grow small, and we grow stupid.
We will soon be nothing but squealing game that the humans hunt for their meat.
You'd risk everything on one last battle?
That's just what the humans want.
I do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe.
Even if every one of us dies, it will be a battle the humans will never forget.
The Forest Spirit.
Come on!
Keep your oxen together!
Hurry!
Get ready now.
Little bit closer.
Fire!
Reload!
Fire!
Ready-- Well, I see somebody is going to have to go play the peacemaker.
Take our riflemen and hide behind the cliffs.
There they are!
Where?
The hunters are ready, sir.
Excellent.
Well done, my boy.
Go and spread the word.
We'll be moving out presently.
Greetings, Jigo.
I've got the emperor breathing down my neck, and you're busy playing war with Lord Asano.
And you'd have nothing to do with him being here, now, would you?
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?
He'll call a truce if I give him half my iron.
Is that right?
Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?
But all the same, you might as well let him have his iron.
Listen, the boars are gathering for battle.
You know what that means.
You made a promise.
Get me the head of the Forest Spirit, then we can come back and destroy Lord Asano together.
Watch out, milady!
There's a horseman coming!
Get in!
Well, speak of the devil, a messenger from Lord Asano.
We have guests.
Mind your manners, ladies.
Yes, ma'am.
Welcome back, milady!
Whoa!
Wait!
Won't you even talk to the man?
Lady Eboshi, mistress of Irontown!
I bring a message to you from my Lord Asano.
You have fought valiantly and well.
Now, open your gates that we may speak with you.
Hmph!
We can hear you just fine from down there.
Milady took this mountain away from the gods, the boars and beasts!
And now that it's worth something, you want it!
Well, you won't get it!
You ladies need to be taught some respect!
Respect?
What's that?
We haven't had any respect since the day we were born!
You want some of our iron?
Here ya go!
They are really something.
They'll fight forest gods or samurai.
It doesn't matter to them.
They're an amazing bunch, your girls.
They were wasted in the brothels.
Impressive for a piece of paper.
Well, you know, it's gotten me all the best hunters and trappers around.
Remember, my dear lady, we're after a god, not just a beast.
Yes, milady, what is it?
Do you have any idea who this paper has come from?
From the emperor himself.
The emperor?
Who's he?
The Mikado.
The Mikado?
Okay, you got me there.
Thank you.
Yes, milady.
Every day that we cut trees and dig for iron, the forest and its creatures grow weaker.
My way, there is no loss of life, Jigo.
Listen, you owe me and I've come to collect.
When you needed riflemen, I sent them, and without them, you lose Irontown.
I'm sorry.
Did that sound like a threat?
Don't tell me the emperor believes... that wives' tale about the Great Spirit's head granting immortality.
I'm sure I don't know what the emperor believes.
I'm just a humble monk.
I'm just trying to get by.
I keep my promises.
We have fought the boars before.
They're easier to kill than Moro and her cubs.
So you can call out that shady bunch you've got hidden under the cliff, Jigo.
So I've been found out.
Just one more thing, milady.
Did a stranger come through here, by any chance?
He's a young man riding a great big red elk.
Came and went.
A bad-looking bunch, if you ask me.
Those men are no ordinary hunters.
They're killers.
Killers?
Milady, at least let some of us go with you.
Yes, you can't trust these men.
They're strangers.
What if it goes wrong and we're stuck here?
We can't help you.
You said yourself we're better shots than the men are.
That's precisely why I want you all here in Irontown.
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.
Once the Forest Spirit is dead, we don't know what will happen.
Will Jigo be satisfied with the creature's head or will he be after my ironworks as well?
Jigo's riflemen may turn on us.
If that happens, I'll need every one of you here to fight them.
Remember, you can't trust men.
Don't worry about her ladyship.
I'll be right at her side, protecting her.
That's what we're afraid of.
What?
Even if you were a woman, you'd still be an idiot!
Do you suffer?
You know, you could always jump, boy.
End it all.
As soon as your strength returns, the mark will spread and destroy you.
It feels like I must've been asleep for weeks.
I had a dream that San was by my side, nursing me.
I was hoping you'd cry out in your sleep.
Then I would have bitten your head off to silence you.
It's a beautiful forest.
Are Okkoto and the boars on the move yet?
Yes, the boars are marching.
The trees cry out as they die, but you cannot hear them.
I listen to the forest's pain and feel the ache of the bullet in my chest, and I dream of the day when I will finally crunch that gun woman's head in my jaws.
Moro, why can't the humans and the forest live together?
Why can't we stop this fighting now?
The humans are gathering for the final battle.
The flames of their guns will burn us all.
And what happens to San?
What's your plan, to let her die with you?
Typical.
Selfish.
You think like a human.
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.
When the forest dies, so does she.
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf!
She's human!
Silence, boy.
How dare you speak to a god like that?
I caught her human parents defiling my forest.
They threw their baby at my feet as they ran away.
Instead of eating her, I raised her as my own.
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter is neither human nor wolf.
How could you help her?
I don't know, but at least we might find a way to live.
How?
Will you join forces with San and fight the humans?
No.
All that would do is cause more hatred.
There is nothing you can do, boy.
Soon the demon mark will spread and kill you.
Leave this place at sunrise.
Return and I shall kill you.
You're feeling all right?
I'm fine, thanks to you and the Forest Spirit.
Yakul, sorry if I worried you.
I guess my legs are still pretty weak?
It's so quiet.
I wonder where the little kodama went.
I can smell the ironworks.
Thanks for showing us the way!
I have another favour to ask!
Will you please give this to San for me?
Let's go.
It stinks, and it burns my eyes.
That's what they want.
They're trying to kill our sense of smell.
It's that damn woman again.
She knows we're out here.
It's a trap and a stupid one.
What?
They're trying to lure the boars out of the forest.
The humans are planning something.
Then we have to find Okkoto while there's still time to stop him or they'll be killed!
Okkoto is too stubborn.
He won't listen.
None of them will.
They may even know it's a trap.
The boars are a proud race.
The last one left alive will still be charging blindly forward.
Why chop the trees down?
To make them angry, which makes them stupid.
Mother, I have to go.
Okkoto's blind.
I must be his eyes.
You understand?
Do as you must.
You know that boy wanted to share his life with you.
I hate him!
I hate all humans!
From Ashitaka for me?
Pretty.
You two, stay with San.
I must go to the Forest Spirit.
Let's go.
The Moro tribe has come to fight with you.
Where can I find Lord Okkoto?
Thank you.
It's coming from Irontown.
Let's go!
Who goes there?
Samurai again.
Halt, I said!
Out of the way!
What the devil was that thing?
Don't waste your arrows.
He's knocking them away.
He's a dead man anyway.
Cease fire!
Toki, come and look.
It can't be.
It's Ashitaka.
So it's not a ghost.
Ashitaka!
Toki!
Are you all right?
We're all right.
Lord Asano's samurai thought they'd try and ambush us while our men were away.
Thought we'd just roll over.
But we showed them!
Where's Lady Eboshi?
She took every able-bodied man and went to kill the Forest Spirit.
We're cut off here.
Can't get a message to Lady Eboshi.
The Forest Spirit.
That explains the explosions.
Hey, sir, I've still got your bow and arrows!
Aren't you gonna tell him you've got his cloak and saddle too?
I do?
You're useless.
Many thanks, Kohroku!
I'll try and bring you some help!
Can you hold out?
Don't worry!
We can always pour hot iron on them.
Bring back Lady Eboshi!
And don't take too long!
I missed.
They're bringing boats across the river!
Go and get Lady Eboshi.
We'll hold them off as long as we can!
I'll be back!
I promise!
Be careful!
Get him!
Stop that man!
Looks like they'll try to cut us off.
Run, Yakul.
Burning animal flesh.
Yakul!
Stay back!
Show me your wound.
You'll have to stay here.
Wait for me.
I'll come back for you.
I said, stay!
We're almost there, my friend.
Who goes there?
My orders are no outsiders permitted here.
All right, but I've just come from Irontown.
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
Tell me where she is.
The Eboshi woman's not here.
Give me the message.
I'll make sure she gets it.
I must speak with her.
Now where is she?
It's really you?
You're still alive, lad?
It looks like you men had a worse time than I did.
We've been burying our friends all day.
It was horrible.
Irontown has come under attack.
What?
The women and the lepers have fallen back to the inner wall.
We haven't got a lot of time.
Those samurai bastards.
Asano must've just been waiting for us to leave Irontown.
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.
She's off hunting down the Forest Spirit.
Then someone's got to stop her.
Call her back.
If you're all done, I want you out of here.
The rest of you, keep digging!
Wait!
What about Irontown?
That's right!
It's our home!
What do they expect us to do, abandon Irontown?
You heard the boy!
We haven't a moment to lose.
Send a message to Lady Eboshi!
No messenger would have a chance of finding her!
Then send out a hunter!
What else are they good for?
Lady Eboshi is just being used by Jigo.
When you fought with the boars, were there any wolves with them?
Did you see San, the Wolf Girl?
I have no idea.
It was pitch black when the animals came at us.
She was there.
I saw her.
I was right in the front line.
I saw everything, everything.
What happened?
I'm not sure!
Everything started happening so fast.
It was like a nightmare.
Jigo's troops put us in front as bait to lure the boars in.
They didn't tell us about the land mines under our feet... or the grenades coming in on top of us.
Where's San?
Take it easy.
I'm trying to get you out.
There's a wolf over here!
Hey!
Hurry!
Young master!
What do you think you're doing?
I have got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf's gonna help me find her.
You're on their side, aren't you, boy?
Stand aside!
What's more important?
The head of the Forest Spirit or saving your town?
Those darts are poison.
That's enough now!
I'm not gonna slave any longer!
Heave.
Look out!
After you've come through the swamp, take cover by the lake until we get there.
Be careful.
Those riflemen with milady belong to Jigo.
Here.
Take these.
Where I'm going, they won't be of any use.
You go with them, Yakul.
Look after him!
Find San!
That's where we'll find Eboshi!
Come on.
Keep moving.
Straight ahead.
Today we finish this.
Sir.
Yes?
Have you spotted them?
Okkoto's badly wounded.
He and the Wolf Girl are making their way to the realm of the Forest Spirit.
So they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
Keep after them, but stay out of sight or you'll scare the Forest Spirit away.
Yes, sir.
I understand.
That was boar's blood painted on his face, wasn't it?
A little trade secret.
Don't want to smell human.
We're almost at the pool of the Forest Spirit.
What was that?
Lord Okkoto, something's wrong.
We have to keep moving.
Something's out there.
What?
With so much blood in the air, I can't smell it.
I should have known it was you!
You did this!
Because of you, the forest will die!
You're wrong!
We've all been fighting to save it!
This is the thanks you give us?
You bring bad things!
Bad things coming, neither human nor animal.
What do you mean, "neither human nor animal"?
They're coming!
It's the end for us!
They're warriors.
They've come back.
My warriors!
They have come back to me from the land of the dead.
Forward, my warriors!
Forward to the pool of the Forest Spirit!
No, Lord Okkoto!
Your warriors haven't come back to you.
Those are humans wearing the skins of your warriors to hide their scent!
It's a trick!
It's just a human trick to get us to lead them to the Forest Spirit!
Come out, Forest Spirit!
If you are truly master here, give my warriors the power to slay the humans and be victorious!
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please!
You've got to listen!
San, they're all around us.
Okkoto's done for.
Leave him!
No!
I won't let him turn into a demon like Nago did!
Tell mother that the humans are setting a trap for the Forest Spirit.
She'll know what to do.
You'll have to hurry, or it could mean the end of all of us!
Go on now.
Stay back or you die!
And then this whole forest will see just what you are!
Ashitaka?
Get back!
I burn!
There are flames growing inside of me.
You must fight it!
Don't let yourself become a demon!
Lord Okkoto!
What is it?
Is it San?
She's in danger.
Let's go.
I'm on fire.
No!
I don't want to become a demon!
Please stop, Okkoto!
You're too slow!
Get on!
A wolf!
Eboshi!
You keep going!
Eboshi!
I have something to say!
Hold your fire!
What is it you want?
Lord Asano's samurai have attacked Irontown!
The women are outnumbered!
They can't hold them off for long!
Forget about the Forest Spirit!
Your men are already heading back, but they need you to lead them!
What proof is there this isn't a lie?
Lie?
Don't be ridiculous!
What reason do I have to lie?
So we don't kill the forest gods.
Now you want us to kill samurai instead.
No!
What I want is for the humans and the forest to live in peace!
Just whose side is he on anyway?
Shouldn't we go back?
The women are on their own now.
They can take care of themselves.
There's the pool.
The creature must be somewhere nearby.
It's the moment of truth, boys, so keep your eyes peeled.
Why do we need that woman, sir?
When you're going to kill a god, let someone else do your dirty work.
Moro, what happened to you?
San!
It's me, Ashitaka!
San!
Ashitaka!
Okkoto?
Leave, boy.
Fight me and the Forest Spirit will never come.
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!
O mighty Lord, let me have the girl!
I beg of you!
Please, let her go!
San!
Are you there?
It's me!
Ashitaka!
San!
Kill him!
Stop him!
He'll ruin everything!
San!
San!
Ashitaka!
San!
Ashitaka!
And here I was saving the last of my strength to bite off that damn woman's head.
But I must save San.
Close ranks!
Don't touch him.
He's no longer a god.
You can't even speak, can you?
Well done, men.
Now, fall back and get the wounded out of here.
Ooh, what a revolting spectacle.
It's him.
Give me back my daughter, demon.
Ashitaka, can you save the girl you love?
The Forest Spirit.
Eboshi!
Hold your fire!
Eboshi!
Your enemy's not the Forest Spirit.
But that should have killed it.
He's a god.
It'll take more than one shot.
San!
Don't die.
I don't get it.
The Great Forest Spirit took their lives away.
Quick!
He's starting to change.
Now watch closely, everyone.
I'm going to show you how to kill a god, a god of life and death.
The trick is not to fear him.
No!
Stop!
Eboshi!
You will die!
She did it!
Quickly!
Go get the head!
Quick, Jigo!
Bring me that box of yours!
The porters are all dead!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Be careful not to touch the spirit's body!
It'll suck the life out of you!
Here it is!
One head, as promised!
Milady!
I told you.
A wolf's head can still bite.
Come on!
We got to get out of here.
It's coming, sir!
Run!
Gonza, we've got to get to the island!
Island?
I can't swim!
Then walk along the bottom.
Give her to me!
I'll cut her throat!
Your claim has been avenged.
Your mother saw to that.
Here.
Lady Eboshi.
Help me.
Don't waste your sympathy.
I promised Toki that I'd bring you back to Irontown.
He's searching for his head.
We can't stay here.
San, you have got to help us.
No!
You're on their side!
You always were!
Take that damn woman and just go away!
Never!
I hate all of you humans!
Yes, I'm human, San, and so are you.
Stop it!
I'm a wolf, you hear?
San?
Stay back!
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop it.
It's over.
Everything's over.
The forest is dead.
Nothing is over.
The two of us are still alive.
Now, will you help me, San?
Hey, wait!
Come back!
Help us!
A little crisis and they panic.
Whoa!
What are you doing?
Look!
The head is moving!
It's calling him to us!
It shouldn't jam anymore.
Thanks.
It's awfully quiet.
Asano is waiting for sunrise.
I wonder if that young man ever found Lady Eboshi.
Don't worry about him.
He found her, all right.
They'll be marching over that hill any minute now.
Big dope.
Don't ask me why I love him.
Hey, Kohroku!
Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.
What's that?
I don't know, but I don't like it.
It's the Nightwalker!
Everybody, hold your positions!
Toki, it's coming right at us.
Run!
We've gotta go!
No!
We promised Lady Eboshi we would defend Irontown!
Look!
Over there!
He's come back!
Get everyone out!
The Great Spirit's head's been cut off, and he wants it back!
If that black ooze touches you, you're dead!
Run for the lake!
The water will slow it down!
Lady Eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side.
I'm gonna try to return his head before he kills us all.
Hurry!
What are we gonna do now?
It'll kill us all!
We'll never get out now!
That's enough!
Get everyone down to the lake and stay calm.
We can carry the sick and the wounded.
Not that way!
Stop!
Oh!
There it goes!
We're done for!
Once the forge burns, it'll be the end of Irontown.
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow.
Now, let's go.
There they are!
Go!
Stop right there!
Oh, you're both alive.
Oh, how nice.
I'm giving the creature its head back.
Put the box down and back away.
Give the head back now?
Come on, boy.
Don't be silly.
Now, when the sun's about to come up?
Look!
He's a brainless, swollen, life-sucking god of death.
At sunrise he'll vanish.
Sir, it's coming!
We've gotta get out of here!
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.
But I might actually get it.
Don't force me to kill you.
You make it sound so very easy.
You really ought to... relax!
Get going!
Ashitaka!
I got it!
This is bad.
Master, we're surrounded!
Come on, sun!
Rise!
Open the box!
Don't you see?
It's too late for that now!
Why are you wasting your breath talking to him?
Human hands must return it!
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Forest Spirit!
We give you back your head!
Take it and be at peace!
Uh, well, that got his attention, all right.
Well, I think it's over.
It's the men.
Milady!
You're here!
Her ladyship has been injured.
Look!
It's falling on Irontown!
Hang on tight, everybody!
Don't let go!
I didn't know the Forest Spirit made the flowers grow.
San.
San, look.
Even if all the trees return, it won't be his forest anymore.
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.
Never.
He's life itself.
He's not dead, San.
He's here right now, trying to tell us something, that it's time for us both to live.
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me, but I can't forgive the humans for what they've done.
I understand.
You'll live in the forest, and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.
I'll always be near.
Yakul and I will come and visit you... whenever we can, all right?
Amazing.
The wolves and that crazy little Wolf Girl helped save us all.
Ashitaka.
Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.
Well, I give up!
You can't win against fools!
THE END
I'll never forget that summer.
I spent a week in the old house where my mother grew up.
Almost there.
Feeling all right?
Yes.
Haru... how many times have I told her?
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Haru!
You're blocking the driveway again.
Sho?
Where are you?
Don't touch!
These aren't for you.
Arrietty!
What?
You went outside again, didn't you?
And you might clean up this room, young lady.
It's my own little garden.
If you ask me, it looks like a mess.
Oh!
Is that a bay leaf?
Oh well, I guess this means your birthday comes early.
Enough for a whole year.
But the bay tree's so far away.
If a human being saw you...
I'm always careful.
The world is full of dangerous creatures.
Your great uncle... ...was eaten by a frog.
Right?
Doesn't that shiso smell lovely?
Yes, it does.
With a bit of sugar I could make shiso juice.
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.
My first borrowing ever!
I've been practicing night and day.
Papa's home.
Welcome back.
Papa, about tonight...
There's a boy in the house.
I saw him.
No!
Arrietty...
He didn't see me!
I hid behind the bay leaf.
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?
I won't hear of it.
It's too dangerous.
But he's just a child!
Papa, I've been waiting for such a long time.
The children can be more savage than the grownups.
I'll be fine!
Youngsters go to bed early.
Thank you Papa!
But Pod...
The boy's sick.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.
But still...
Stop worrying, Mother.
We'll be extra careful.
Arrietty will be 14 soon.
Someday she'll have to survive without our help.
Sometimes I think we're the last Borrowers in the world.
Whatever you need, just ask Haru.
All right.
Haru, I'm depending on you.
Yes ma'am.
Let's shut the screen.
Keep the bugs out.
Oh?
Shouldn't you wear something darker?
I already decided!
I hope you can borrow some tissue paper.
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?
We could have shiso juice and sugar for the tea.
But anything's just fine.
We'll be back soon.
Please be careful.
We will.
Arrietty!
Sorry!
Hold these for me.
Yes, Papa.
Hold on tight!
Arrietty?
Ready?
Yes.
Everything's so huge!
The world of human beings.
The sugar's over there.
Wait for me down there.
Papa, you're great!
Now let's get that tissue.
Papa, look.
Your first borrowing.
Be careful, it's sharp.
I will!
Papa, borrowing is such fun!
Look down there.
Rats.
Steer clear of them.
They're trouble.
I'm not afraid.
I'm ready for anything.
I've got this!
Sometimes it's best not to go looking for danger.
What is this place?
Human beings made it for their dolls.
It's just perfect for us!
I'm sure Mother would love that dresser over there.
These things aren't for borrowing.
If anything went missing they'd know right away.
Oh...
Don't be afraid.
I saw you.
In the garden.
It was you, wasn't it?
My mother told me about you.
She saw little people here when she was young.
Was it you that she saw?
Was it?
I'm sorry, Papa.
He saw me today, out in the garden.
I should've been more careful.
I hope he didn't frighten you.
Best not tell your mother, it will only worry her.
All right.
You don't always have to run.
Observe them first, then decide.
We're home.
Safe and sound.
And...?
Things didn't go well this time.
This light gave out before we finished.
Oh dear.
We had to give up on the sugar.
Don't give it a thought.
At least you're safe and sound.
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your first borrowing.
What a pretty pin.
Time for bed.
Good night.
She looks worn out.
Shall I make some tea?
Sho!
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.
A cube of sugar?
But whatever for?
He left it by the grating.
It's probably the same one I dropped last night.
What?
What do you mean, you dropped it?
Don't touch it.
Do you understand?
It's a trap.
They're trying to catch us!
We'll have to stop borrowing for a while.
Maybe they already know where we are.
Pod, we'll have to move!
This was such a lovely house.
Now we'll have to start all over again.
Well, let's see how things go.
Now eat, soup's getting cold.
Why did it have to be sugar?
Thank you Arrietty.
I wanted to hang everything while the sun's out.
You know I love doing laundry.
I'm going to nap for a bit.
All right.
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING You came back.
Wait, don't go.
Please leave us alone.
I wanted to tell you that.
I want to talk to you.
Human beings are dangerous.
If we're seen, we have to leave.
My parents said so.
You have a family?
I envy you.
Don't you have one?
Yes, but I practically never see my father.
Mother's so busy at work, she barely has time for me.
Really...
My name's Sho.
What's your name?
Do you have one?
Of course I have a name!
It's Arrietty.
Arrietty...
Arrietty...
That's pretty.
Won't you let me see you?
Just for a moment.
Just a peek.
Please?
What's happening?
Oh my gosh, it's a crow!
You can't come in here!
What got into that bird?
They never behave like that.
Maybe it's nesting season or something.
Now I have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?
Are you all right?
Maybe you should take some of your medicine.
Thanks, Haru.
I feel fine.
The nesting season, eh?
Have yourself a nice long rest now.
Papa...
I told you to stay away.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to do something to help.
But he didn't see me.
You put your family in danger.
I won't say it again.
Understand?
Yes.
We'd better start looking.
It's time.
Pod...
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING Afternoon!
Package for you.
Thanks again ma'am.
It's pretty hot out there.
Listen, know any good pest control companies?
Pest control?
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service." Squeaky Klean Service?
Let me just write that down.
Having problems with mice?
Maybe it's mice, or maybe it's something else.
Between us, it's little people.
I've seen them myself.
A crow tried to fly into your room?
I hope it didn't scare you.
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out.
I was so astonished!
I never saw such a huge...
Excitement's the worst thing in the world for his heart.
He came here for peace and quiet.
If anything were to happen before the operation...
I know, I know.
I realize his mother's terribly busy at work.
But to go abroad on business and leave a sick child?
It must be terribly hard for you without your mother.
I don't mind.
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped.
But why can't she be here, when he needs her so?
Aunt Sadako, who made that little house in my room?
It's amazing.
You mean the doll house?
That doll house belongs to your mother.
She left it here when she moved out.
It was hers?
My father had it made to order in England.
It was for the little people.
My father claimed he'd seen them.
He waited for so many years.
He always said that house was a present for them.
But I'm afraid they never showed themselves again.
Not in my father's lifetime, nor in mine.
Young Master, did you happen to see any little people in your room?
Unfortunately... no.
It's been in our family for four generations.
If you like it, it will be yours someday.
You mean it?
Yes.
Have you looked inside?
It's quite beautiful!
Haru, could you turn off the lights?
Yes'm.
This is the living room.
All the furnishings were hand made by a real furniture maker.
Isn't it wonderful?
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a bathroom.
But the next room is my personal favorite.
Haru, could you open that up?
Let's see, I think it opens this way.
Everything is so detailed!
Detailed and just like the real thing.
That's a real oven.
You could use it for baking.
Beautiful, just beautiful.
What a pity Father's dream never came true.
And it's been so long...
Maybe the little people are gone now.
Mother, we've had these pictures three years.
Don't you want new ones?
I love those pictures.
I've always dreamed I'd see the real ocean someday.
Besides, there's no point changing them now.
Papa's later than usual.
I hope he didn't get caught in that downpour.
Papa?
That's the back door.
Papa!
Welcome back...
Twisted my leg.
It's lucky Spiller found me.
Pod?
Oh dear, you're hurt!
Hurry, bring him in.
Does it hurt?
It's not broken.
I'll be fine in no time.
I'll get some cold water.
Here's a towel, better dry off.
Who's this?
It's not just the three of us after all.
Gotta go.
Wait, at least stay and have some tea.
I'll see to your father.
Get Spiller a cup of tea.
Okay.
Thank you Spiller.
Papa's so lucky you came along.
We're so grateful for your help.
Listen, have you seen other Borrowers?
You see, we thought we might be the only ones left.
This many.
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay!
Can I see your bow?
You use this for hunting.
Give that back.
It's not a toy.
Gotta go.
Won't you stay and have a bite?
Got this.
A cricket's leg!
Want some?
It's real good.
No thanks!
Take care.
Thanks again.
I'll see him out.
You were looking for a new place.
I tripped and fell.
Couldn't move.
Then Spiller came.
Really...
His territory reaches past the river.
And he knows a few places we could live.
That's good I suppose.
I'd hate to camp out.
But I doubt we'll find anything quite as nice as this.
I'm glad there are still others like us.
Do you have friends and family, Spiller?
Family?
No, just me.
Well, I hope you can come again.
My mother's stew is the best in the world.
Haru?
Arrietty, your stitches need to be closer together.
Pull it apart and do it again.
Why do we need such a big sack anyway?
I'm going to look in on Papa.
Papa, can I come in?
How's your leg?
I'll be walking soon.
Papa?
Are we going to move?
We were seen.
We've no choice but to move.
I don't think every human being is dangerous.
Arrietty...
Before you were born, there were two other families living in this house.
One family went missing.
They just disappeared.
The other one moved away.
They were seen by humans.
No matter what happens, we've got to survive.
Papa...
What in heaven's name!
Is this an earthquake?
Mother!
It won't open.
The frame's buckled.
The... the wall!
Homily!
Homily!
I always dreamed of having a kitchen like this.
This again?
Gather only the things we need.
We can't carry all that.
And Homily, take nothing from the doll house.
I'll make sure it's safe.
Stay with your mother.
Yes, Papa.
You finally came.
Do you like your new kitchen?
Our house is a disaster.
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye.
Can I look?
You're beautiful.
We have to move.
We were seen.
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.
Borrowers...?
We borrow from human beings.
Things we need.
Things they won't miss.
Soap and cookies and sugar.
Electricity and gas, too.
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.
No one ever saw them?
Probably.
It's all my fault.
Niya, don't be like that.
Be nice to her.
Are there other little people like you in the house?
No, it's just my father and mother and me.
What about in other houses?
I'm sure there are some.
I've only met one so far.
Oh.
Soon you'll be the only one left.
Every year there's fewer of you, right?
You're a doomed species, you know.
That's not true!
There's lots more of us.
Spiller said so!
Spiller?
He's one of us.
And he said there's lots more.
Do you know how many people there are in the world?
There are 6.7 billion of us.
Six point seven billion...?
What about you?
I don't know.
There's probably just a few of you.
Until my mom told me, I didn't know little people existed.
Lots of species are already extinct.
I've only seen them in books, though.
So many beautiful species...
But the environment changed, so they died out.
It's sad, but that's what fate has in store for your kind.
Fate, you say?
You're the one who changed things.
Now we have to move away.
We have to survive.
That's what Papa said.
So we're leaving, even though it's dangerous.
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!
We're not going to die out that easily!
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I'm the one who's going to die.
It's my heart.
They're going to operate next week, but it's probably hopeless.
Your heart...?
I've always been sick.
I can't play like other kids.
From the moment I saw you, I wanted to protect you.
I can't even do that.
I hope you can forgive me.
I didn't know you were so sick.
What in the world is this doing here?
What?
It's the kitchen from the doll house!
Found you!
What's wrong?
My mother...
I heard her voice.
This really is a great kitchen.
You're not the only little one here, I bet.
I have to go.
Help!
Help!
Let me out!
Help me!
There we go.
Please, let me out!
Please!
The ceiling's tilted.
Hello?
Hello?
Squeaky Klean Service?
Yes.
I have an emergency.
For extermination?
There's something small in the house.
No, not mice.
Not mice?
I don't want them killed.
You need trapping services?
Yes, that's it.
I want you to trap them.
Sho!
Sho!
Arrietty!
Mother's gone!
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human being got her!
Momma...
We'll find her.
What?
It's locked.
Let's try the room next door.
Can't budge it.
Wait!
I can fit.
Amazing!
No, that's not it.
There's a dirt road.
Turn in there.
Before the bridge?
No, not that one!
Haru opened this.
Then she must've taken Mother someplace.
Are you okay?
What's taking them so long?
Mother!
Where are you?
But the lock...
Lock?
Could I have some hot milk?
Okay, wait just a minute.
Thanks.
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?
Mother!
Mother!
Mother?
Arrietty!
Here I am, Arrietty!
Mother!
Arrietty!
There they are.
They finally found the right road.
Another human being!
It's all right, Mother.
We'd like to take a look around first.
Take your time.
SQUEAKY KLEAN SERVICE Now who can this be?
Don't be too rough.
Haru?
Haru!
Yes?
What's going on here?
It's finally happened.
The little people are here!
Little people?
That's right.
And what little thieves they are!
It's really true.
They steal from all over the house.
That's why things were going missing.
Haru, what's gotten into you?
All these years I thought it was my imagination.
Well, it wasn't.
You certainly didn't need to call the exterminators.
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!
You'll believe me when you see this.
This is their nest.
Nest?
It looks like a pile of old junk to me.
What?
I swear I saw it.
Haru, I'm sending the exterminators away.
Now, wait just a minute.
The doll house!
Young Master?
May we come in for a minute?
All right.
You won't believe this.
They stole the little kitchen too.
You'll see, it's gone.
It's not gone.
Such a pleasure to look at.
Wait, I can prove it!
I have one of them in a jar.
I wonder what's gotten into Haru.
Hmm?
Fresh herbs, how lovely.
Someone was making tea!
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.
Yes, there are.
So Haru really saw them.
Though she accused them of stealing.
They're not thieves at all!
They're Borrowers.
I mean, I wish I could see them.
I bet they're here somewhere.
I'm sure they are.
Excuse me, ma'am!
Where'd you like us to start?
Are you all right?
It got away.
I had one and it got away!
It's not just my imagination.
There are little people here!
Next time I swear I'll get them!
How far is it to where we're meeting Spiller?
It's just outside the forest.
Then we head down river.
I'm already worn out.
I'll never make it that far.
Let's hurry.
I can't do it...
Better have something to eat.
We'll be walking till morning.
What?
I'm so sorry.
It's my fault we had to leave such a wonderful house.
That's in the past.
We'll make another wonderful house, the three of us together.
I'm going outside for a bit.
Don't go too far, now.
Niya!
Niya...
Just a little further.
Spiller!
That's everything.
Now let's get moving.
Okay.
Mother, are you all right?
Arrietty!
Sho!
Arrietty...
We're leaving now.
I'm glad I made it.
Niya showed me the way.
Thanks.
Take care of yourself.
I brought this.
I hope you'll accept it this time.
Thank you.
I have to go.
When is your operation?
The day after tomorrow.
I'm going to be okay.
You gave me the courage to live.
For luck.
Thanks.
You protected me after all.
Arrietty...
I hope you have the best life ever.
Goodbye.
Arrietty, you're a part of me now.
I'll never forget you, ever.
I'm fourteen years old, I'm pretty A light-hearted little lady For a long time, under the floor I've been living as a Borrower Sometimes I'm happy Sometimes I'm blue I'd love to meet somebody I want to feel the wind in my hair And to gaze at the sky I want to bring you a flower It's a different world out there Look, butterflies are dancing Waiting for me Yes, nothing ever changes In my little world It's not that I hate it But I want to know More and more about you My happiness and sadness always Get mixed up with each other I want to feel the wind in my hair And to gaze at the sky I want to bring you a flower It's a different world out there Look, butterflies are dancing Waiting for you Under the sun And surrounded by flowers I want to spend the days with you With these memories in my heart I'll live my own way In a new world THE END
September 21, 1945.
That was the night I died.
So disgusting!
Watch it!
He's filthy.
Is he dead?
Such a disgraceful sight.
Don't want Americans to see this!
Mama!
What day is it today?
Setsuko...
Another one...
What's this?
Don't bother.
Just toss it.
This one is going too.

To the shelters!
Hear it's a large formation.
The shelter behind the firehouse should be safe.
Maybe they'll bomb elsewhere this time?
Makes me hot.
Now be a good girl and put this on.
I'll have a head start now.
You two, be sure to hurry along.
Setsuko, listen to your big brother.
Mama, you should hurry and go!
Yes, dear.
Mama, you got your medicine?
Yes, I got it.
I don't like shelters.
You want to get blown to bits?
Climb on!
My doll!
To the shelters!
Seita.
Heads down!
No!
Seita!
Seita!
Seita!
Seita!
Hurry!
Did you get everything?
Don't forget that!
Quick!
Don't forget that!
Quick!
Long live the Emperor!
Don't worry.
We're safe here.
Where did Mama go?
She's in the shelter.
It could stand even a 250-kg bomb.
She'll be fine.
Mama will come to the twin pines.
We agreed to meet there.
Let's rest a little.
Everything all right, Setsuko?
I lost a clog.
I'll buy you a much better one.
I have money too.
Open this.
You're rich!
So this is black rain.
It's all gone...
Look, that's the public hall.
Remember we had porridge there?
Did our house burn down?
Seems like it.
What are we going to do?
Dad will make them pay.
Mama!
Mama!
I'd feel guilty if only our house was left.
Glad it's all gone.
Mr.
Miura got a direct hit.
I feel so sorry for him.
I'm glad you were safe.
We got two direct hits.
The oil would spill if we tried to move them.
No, it's not her!
Seita, I have to pee.
Okay.
Attention, residents of Kaminaka, Kaminishi, and Ichirizuka!
Please go to the elementary school!
We've set up a first aid station!
What's wrong?
My eyes hurt.
Don't rub them.
Let's go get them washed.
Where's Mama?
She'll be at school.
School?
Yes, let's hurry.
Okay.
Don't cry.
Be good now.
Seita!
Have you seen your mother?
She's injured.
You must go at once.
I'll stay with her.
That was scary.
You didn't cry?
Let's wait for your brother here.
Seita, I've been looking for you.
How are you?
Where's Mama?
Come with me.
This is your Mama's.
In here.
She's finally asleep now.
She should be moved to a hospital.
We're asking about it.
I hear Kaisei Hospital wasn't hit.
Sir.
Mama has a bad heart.
Can she get medicine for that?
Okay, we'll ask.
I'll come again.
Mama?
You saw her?
Yes...
I'm so sorry.
I'm thirsty.
Is there anything I can do?
I know.
Did you get biscuits?
I'll get you some.
Keep this ring in your purse.
Don't lose it, okay?
Mama's a little sick, but she'll be better soon.
Where is she?
In a hospital in Nishinomiya.
So tonight, we'll stay at school.
Then tomorrow...
Remember our aunt in Nishinomiya?
Then tomorrow...
Remember our aunt in Nishinomiya?
We're going there.
Okay?
We're staying upstairs.
Won't you join us?
Thank you, we'll go later.
See you later then.
Want to eat?
I want to go see Mama.
Maybe tomorrow.
It's late now.
Hey, look at this!
Can't unwrap her.
Better not look.
Especially in this heat...
Got to get rid of this today.
Where's your little sister?
I took her to Nishinomiya this morning.
Distant relatives are taking us in.
Glad to hear that.
Well, I must get back to my duties.
You take care.
Mama!
Where's Mama?
Is Mama still not feeling good?
That's right.
She got hurt in the air raid.
You're back.
How was it?
Was she in Kaisei Hospital?
Err, yes...
Navy folks are so privileged.
Using a truck even to evacuate!
Mosquito net and beddings are in your room.
Thank you.
Doesn't Mama need this ring anymore?
Do I get to keep it?
You should put that away.
About Mama...
We'll visit Mama when she's better.
Okay.
Go to bed now.
Okay.
Herrings, dried bonito, dried potatoes, and eggs.
There're pickled plums.
Why, this is butter!
You'd never know things are scarce in wartime.
You military folks are spoiled.
So, did you stop by the hospital?
Your mother and I must talk about the future.
I could take Setsuko along and visit her.
She didn't make it?!
Mama died at school two days ago.
What?!
Your Mama died...!
Why didn't you tell me right away?
You should know better.
Didn't want Setsuko to know.
Your Mama's dead...
This is bad.
Must inform your father at once!
Seita!
She bought me new clogs.
Good for you.
Welcome home.
Tough times for you kids.
Thank you for the bath.
What's that sound?
Don't be scared.
They're bullfrogs.
A firefly!
Here, catch.
Oh no!
You squished it!
It smells.
You squeezed too tight.
Look at all those fireflies!
Setsuko, close your eyes and say “aah.” What for?
Just say “aah.” Fruit drops!
Fruit drops, fruit drops!
I almost swallowed it.
We're back.
What took you so long?
Did you thank the lady?
Yes, Ma'am.
That looked good.
Seita, don't you have to go to school?
Kobe Steel where I was mobilized was destroyed.
And my school burned, so there is no place left to go.
And did you send your father a letter?
Yes, in care of Kure Naval Base.
When?
Over ten days ago, after we came here.
That's strange.
He hasn't replied to me either.
Setsuko, be sure to return those.
How is the war situation?
Getting worse, I'm afraid.
Factories must step up for those that burned.
All we hear is “Gear up for final battle.” Food rations keep getting worse too.
We're all suffering in this war.
My girl is also working for our country.
You must eat and put on strength.
Not again.
Taking in two more must be tough.
But poor things.
They're still so young.
Is your heat rash itchy?
It's hot in here.
I hate shelters.
Hang in there.
I'm here for you.
Want to go to the beach?
Yes!
Yes, let's go!
It's all vegetable fields now!
What are they doing?
Getting salt water.
Not enough salt or soy sauce at home.
I see.
Now take off your clothes!
Might be a bit cold.
It's cold!
Isn't this soothing on your rash?
Uh-huh.
It's a huge bathtub!
Hey you!
Wait!
I'm a bear!
I'm going to eat you!
Snip, snip, snip.
Look.
Somebody is sleeping.
Don't look at that.
Summertime, I'll teach you how to swim.
But I'll get hungry if I swim.
But I'll get hungry if I swim.
Seita!
Setsuko!
Come indoors!
You must be hungry!
There are ice-cold drinks too!
Mama!
Did you wait long?
I'm so glad you came.
How are you doing?
I'm doing fine.
Everyone is nice here.
I'm hungry.
Get up.
There's an air raid coming.
I'm tired.
I want a piggyback ride.
To the shelters!
Your mother won't need her kimono anymore.
Why not exchange it for rice?
I've been slowly trading my things for more food too.
This should get about 15-kg. 15-kg...?!
You must also eat to build a strong body and go to war.
This is worth 15-kg?
I'm sure your mother will be happier this way.
I'll take these now.
No!
Setsuko, you're awake.
They're Mama's!
They're Mama's!
No!
You can't take them!
Setsuko, let go.
No, no, no!
Setsuko!
Setsuko!
Isn't this fine rice?
Setsuko, we'll have steamed rice tonight.
These are for you two to keep.
Look!
It's rice, Setsuko.
Here you go.
The two are working late.
Too bad they can't eat while it's hot.
Setsuko, isn't this rice yummy?
I want more!
Yes, dear.
Setsuko eats a lot when it's rice.
It tastes so good!
What's the matter?
I don't want porridge.
Aren't there any pickled plums?
You know they're long gone.
Here's your lunch.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
I'll be off.
You take care.
We'll have rice balls for lunch, so eat.
Enough!
Our lunch will be porridge!
You loafers expect to eat the same as those working for our country?!
Seita, you're old enough to understand about helping out.
You don't share your rice, but now you want more of ours.
That's unacceptable!
Give you a little bit of rice, and already you're spoiled!
But that's our rice.
Are you saying your aunt isn't fair?
You sure talk big.
This is what I get for taking in two orphans?
Well then.
From now on, we'll eat separately.
That should be fair.
Seita, you have relatives in Tokyo, don't you?
One's on your mother's side?
Why don't you write to them?
Nishinomiya could be firebombed anytime.
But I don't have their address.
Let's hurry home.
Yes, Daddy is waiting for us.
Frogs are singing.
Let's go home.
Sorry for the long wait!
What is it?
I'm hungry.
I'm thirsty too.
Alrighty.
Here, have a fruit drop.
Mama had 7,000 yen saved in the bank. 7,000!
That's plenty to live on.
We're going to be all right.
I'm telling Dad to write back soon, because Setsuko is waiting.
You two are in luck.
You can't find such a good stove nowadays at any price.
Items are scarce, especially hardware.
Can't get those anywhere!
I'll take that comb, and do you have an umbrella?
I'm afraid not.
Oh, but wait.
Rain, rain, fall, fall.
So happy my big brother came With an umbrella to take me home.
Splish-splish, splash-splash, la-la-la!
Good fire, huh?
Just be careful with that.
We will!
What's up with those two?
They're cooking on their own now.
That's very noble of them.
More, please.
Mama, were you harsh on them again?
So I was, but they won't apologize.
Then they bought cooking equipment, just to spite me!
I'm done!
That's bad manners, Seita.
You can relax too.
That's for two.
That's it?!
The next ration should be in July.
Let me do it.
Is it sweet?
I can taste so many flavors!
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint...
Setsuko, you can have it all.
It's all gone!
Gone to bed without washing their dishes!
Doing as they please.
Those brats are so annoying!
Not again!
Mama!
Seita!
Others here are working for our country.
At least stop that girl's crying!
With the nightly raids and crying, how can we sleep?!
Chubu military area information.
Enemy bombers are flying north along the Kii Channel.
Are you going to the cave again?
You're old enough to help fire fighting duties!
All clear!
I want to go home.
I hate living with our aunt.
We don't have a home.
It was burned.
E-D-C-D-E-A-G E-E-E-D-C-D Let's sing!
Carp streamers Up higher than the roof.
The big black carp is the Dad.
Stop it!
Are you crazy?
We're at war!
I'll get yelled for that!
You pests bring us nothing but trouble!
You're useless in raids.
If you're so scared, then go live in that cave!
You know what?
This can be our home.
Nobody comes here.
It's sturdy.
We can do whatever we want.
It's all right to do that?
Thank you for everything.
We're going.
Going...?
Where to?
We're not sure yet.
Well, take care then.
Goodbye, Setsuko!
This will be the kitchen.
This is the front door.
Where's the bathroom going to be?
That can be anywhere.
I'll go with you.
Thank you for the cart!
Just leave it there.
Could you sell us more straw and some food?
There isn't much to sell, but sure.
There you go!
My mouth is watering.
I'm hungry!
Heard you could eat those too.
Frogs?
They say they're good.
I'll do the rest.
You go wait in the net.
What is it?
I left my toothbrush.
Then don't brush tonight.
You'll get bug bites.
Stay inside the net.
It's dark and I'm scared.
I'll go for a pee.
Want to go too?
It's a kamikaze plane.
Looks like a firefly.
It does.
Hey, let's catch fireflies.
Get in.
I can see your face!
I can see you too.
Look, it's a hairpin.
Now, let's see a firefly light show!
Before you were born, I went to a naval review.
A naval review?
Dad was on the cruiser Maya.
The entire combined fleet was there!
Iron castle afloat on the sea.
For offense and defense, we trust in thee.
Enemy attack!
I wonder where Dad is fighting now.
No, let go!
What's that?
It's a grave.
Mama's also in a grave, right?
Auntie told me.
Mama is already dead and in a grave.
We'll go to her grave one day.
Setsuko, do you remember the cemetery near Nunobiki?
That's where Mama is.
Under a big camphor tree...
Why do fireflies have to die so soon?
Hey, somebody is living here.
Homeless, maybe?
What if he's here?
There's even a swing.
A kid lives here.
What's this?
May you rest in peace!
Wish this were real.
Hey!
It says “Setsuko”.
Look!
Dried frogs!
They eat those?!
Wonder if the evacuated boys also eat stuff like this?
Yuck!
Ground soybeans!
Worse than what we eat!
It's a ghost!
Wait!
Wait for me!
And we've already traded all of our mother's kimono for rice.
You used to take money...
This isn't about kimono or money.
I'm a farmer, but even I don't have extra food to share.
Any other relatives?
We can't contact them.
Then be wise.
Go back to your aunt's.
Everything is rationed nowadays.
We must rely on neighborhood groups.
Tell her you're sorry and want to stay.
Thank you, but we'll try elsewhere.
You're a navy man's son!
Be strong!
It's okay?
Oh, no!
You must eat your beans and millet.
You got to eat to grow big!
Seita?
Something is wrong with my tummy.
Are you cold?
The diarrhea doesn't go away.
You bastard!
Forgive me!
I'm sorry!
Please let me go!
Wanted some sugar for my sick sister!
Shut up!
Stealing crops is a serious crime in wartime!
You're not going to get away with this!
What?
Even dug up these small ones?
So you're the crop thief!
Seita!
Please forgive me.
I won't do it again!
No, we're going to the police!
I'm sending you off to jail!
My sister is really sick!
She has no one but me!
Seita!
Seita!
Seita!
Seita.
Seita...
Understood.
I'll talk to him and file a report.
That will be enough.
You can go now.
But...
You've beaten him enough.
It's an injurious assault... ...to a minor!
I will be going then...!
Tonight's air raid was in Fukui.
Why not come in for a drink of water?
Setsuko.
Seita!
Seita.
Where does it hurt?
You must see a doctor and get a shot.
Setsuko!
Seita, I want to go to the toilet.
Can you hold it?
Uh-huh.
Get on my back.
The brother went to the mountain to cut firewood.
The grandmother...
Hurry!
Hurry!
Setsuko, let's eat.
Today's pumpkin is good!
It tastes like real bean jelly.
I hate bean jelly.
Come on, Dad'll get mad at me if you don't eat.
I'll help you, so cheer up and eat!
When you get well, we'll go to the beach again.
Go, go!
Yay!
Bang!
This will bring us food, Setsuko!
Seita...?
Seita?
You say this was your Mama's?
How can this cheap flimsy thing be a keepsake?!
Setsuko?
Setsuko?
Setsuko!
Seita...
Water...
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
And she's had diarrhea for many days now.
The rash isn't from the heat.
Seawater just hurts her skin.
She's weak from malnutrition.
Thus, the diarrhea.
Okay, next!
Can you give her medicine or a shot?
I hate shots!
Please give her some medical treatment.
Medicine won't help.
All she needs is nutrition.
Nutrition...?
What's wrong?
But where can I get that'?!
Am I hungry.
What do you want to eat?
Tempura, sashimi, tokoroten noodles...
Anything else?
Ice cream.
And...
I want fruit drops again.
Fruit drops?
Alrighty.
I'll go withdraw all our savings.
I don't need anything.
Please stay home with me.
Don't go!
Don't go!
Don't go!
Don't worry, Setsuko.
I'll go buy rice and nutritious food for you...
Then, I'll never ever leave.
I'll always be with you.
I promise.
Here's 3,000 yen.
A typhoon is coming?
What a joke!
Our “divine wind” comes after we've surrendered.
Surrendered...?
We lost the war?!
You didn't know?
Is it true?
The Great Empire of Japan lost?
Yes, it was unconditional surrender.
Where's our fleet?
They're long gone.
All sunk!
Not even a ship left.
What?!
Dad's cruiser too?!
Is that why we got no reply?!
How should I know?
Strange boy.
Dad, I hate you!
I'm so hungry.
Dad.
Now even Dad's dead.
Now even Dad's dead.
Now even Dad's...
Setsuko, sorry I'm so late.
I'll make you rice gruel.
It went up.
It went down.
Oh, it stopped.
Even got chicken and eggs!
And there's also...
What's that in your mouth?!
This is a marble.
It's not a fruit drop!
You're getting something better today.
Your favorite.
Seita, this is for you.
What is it, Setsuko?
It's steamed rice.
Here's some cooked soy pulp.
Please eat.
You're not having any?
Setsuko...!
See?
It's watermelon.
I didn't steal this either.
Here, have some.
It's yummy...
Hold on.
I'll make you rice gruel with eggs.
I'll leave these here for you.
Okay?
Seita...
Thank you.
Setsuko never woke up.
Here's a special ration of charcoal.
You can cremate the child on temple grounds.
Undress the body, and use dry husks to start a good fire.
The weather is so fine today!
Nothing has changed!
It's great to be back home!
We can finally listen to the gramophone!
I missed this lovely view!
Come home soon!
Next morning...
I put Setsuko's ashes into the drops tin and left.
I never went to the cave again.
Seita!
It's late.
Go to sleep now.
Okay.

WHISPER OF THE HEART Hello.
Hot, isn't it?
I'm home.
Thanks.
You don't need a bag just for milk!
They put it in one.
Just say no!
Pour me some, too.
Dad, want some barley tea?
Please...
I'll come over.
Thanks.
Is the word processor open?
I'm still printing.
I should buy an electronic notebook.
You smoke too much.
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.
No.
Shiho wears me out.
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.
Do you need lunch?
No, I'll eat out.
The library's busy updating to a barcode system.
I like the checkout cards better.
Me, too.
Hey, this isn't right...
What?
Did you leave out a line?
You're right!
Let me go first.
I have to get this right or my professor will complain.
SEIJI AMASAWA - JULY 5TH This guy...
You can read, but don't stay up too late.
Good night.
I thought I'd seen that name before...
Here, too...
LIBRARY WITHDRAWAL CARD SEIJI AMASAWA - JULY 27TH SEIJI AMASAWA - JULY 28TH SEIJI AMASAWA - JULY 5TH He's taken all these books out before me.
Seiji Amasawa...
What's he like?
Wonder if he's nice.
SEIJI AMASAWA Shizuku!
Get up!
I'm leaving!
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.
Bye!
Oh, no!
I've got to meet Yuko!
My purse...
You ran back upstairs again?
Yeah.
That's funny...
Try by the phone...
Yes! where you left it.
I'm late!
Lock the door!
Clumsy!
It's flying so low!
Today's a lucky day!
It's a hot day!
How's it going?
Hit it!
Hi, Shizuku!
Hi!
Keep it up!
Miss Kosaka?
Tsukishima?
What are you doing here?
Could I ask a favor?
Nothing weird, I hope...
Let me in the library!
What?
Can't you wait till school starts?
I've read all my books, and the public library's closed.
I'm reading 20 before school starts. 20?
Don't forget you've got high school entrance exams.
Hurry up!
Here it is!
Bring it here.
Give me your library card and the book's checkout card.
Yes, ma'am.
No one's ever borrowed this book!
It's rare.
They don't even have it at the public library.
DONATED AMASAWA'S COLLECTION "Amasawa"...
Miss!
Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?
Look what you made me do!
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.
Ask an older teacher.
Shizuku!
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!
If I have to stand in the sun I get more freckles!
Sorry!
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.
They're a serious problem, Miss!
Yeah, yeah... all right, out of here, both of you.
Move up!
Move up!
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?
White clouds spreading up over a hill A road winds up to the town An old house with small windows An old dog waits for me to come home Country road leading far away The road to my old home town West Virginia, my mother the mountain My good old home town That's not bad.
Yes, it is.
It's trite.
Yeah?
I wrote another one.
Concrete roads, everywhere Cut down all the trees Filled in the valleys Western Tokyo Tama Mountain My home town is concrete roads What is this?
But what's this "problem?" You don't need the lyrics yet...
No... are you in love with anyone?
What?
Studying for these exams would be easier if I had someone.
We could support each other.
Yuko!
You're in love!
You got a love letter?
Shh!
When?
Who?
Is he handsome?
He's in another class.
He's not bad.
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!
Yeah, but...
So there's someone else you like!
You can't hide it from me!
Spit it out!
It's Su...
Su...
Tsukishima!
Bring me my bag, will you?
Sugimura!
That blue sports bag.
Come on, Tsukishima!
Throw it over here.
Shut up and go back to the bench!
I'm a starter, and we're going to the playoffs!
Yuko?
You're in love with Sugimura?
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!
Don't worry.
He's too dense.
What about the guy who wrote you a letter?
I'll think about it for a while.
I see.
At least your parents aren't always pushing you to study.
Silence isn't always great.
I wonder...
Oh, no!
What?
I forgot my book!
I need to go back.
You can ride my bike.
No.
You'll be late for cram school.
I'll call you.
That book...
Oh, is it yours?
Here, "Shizuku Tsukishima".
How do you know my name?
Guess!
My library card...
I'd forget about "Concrete Roads", though.
You read it!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk!
Jerk! "I'd forget about 'Concrete Road'..." Get lost!
DONATED AMASAWA'S COLLECTION Did you see?
They were swimming like this!
I'm home.
Shiho?
You're already back?
I'm beat!
I got a ride with someone who was coming this way.
Where's Mom?
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.
You could clean up a little...
What about dinner?
I'm going to wash the rice.
Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!
I'm on it!
Mom's busy!
We've got to help!
Do the rice and put away the laundry.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.
Auntie says to come and see her when you get into high school.
Are you studying?
Don't think you can take it easy just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.
I know!
She even wanted me to bring home some soy sauce!
That's your aunt, all right.
It was the same thing last year.
Yes!
It was miso!
Boy, was it heavy!
Two kilos of it!
Shizuku!
Get up and vacuum by your desk!
I'm washing the sheets.
And airing the bedding.
Where's Mom?
Long gone.
Put that stuff away and go and bring Dad his lunch.
Me?
Why not?
You're going to the library.
Shall I go instead?
Are you gonna clean the toilet, the tub and the balcony and go to the store?
Don't forget to turn the bedding and fix dinner.
I'm going!
Shizuku!
Mail these, will you?
What?
M-A-I-L!
You don't have to read them!
Take the paper-clip off.
Your boyfriend?
Idiot!
MUKAIHARA STATION NO BIKE PARKING Will you be there?
Yeah.
Next stop, Suginomiya.
The exit will be on the left-hand side.
Hey kitty, are you alone?
Where are you going?
What's out there?
Hey!
Answer me!
I'm getting off here.
What about you?
See you.
Hey!
A cat!
KODAMA LINE SUGINOMIYA STATION The library's that way!
And it felt just like the start of a story...
There he is!
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY NO ENTRY What a hill!
How far up is he going?
Kitty?
Kitty?
Does he live around here?
Hey, kitty!
Where are you going?
Do you live around here?
I never knew there was a place like this way up here...
SUZUKI That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!
Maybe you're teasing me, too.
WORLD EMPORIUM SHIRO NISHI, PROP I never would've guessed there was a store like this one up here either...
Cool!
Are you that cat?
Oh, hello...
Um...
That's all right.
Look around all you want.
Baron gets bored.
Baron?
Is that the name of this statue?
Yep.
Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.
Quite the name...
Sorry.
Thanks.
I'm fine now.
That's a great clock.
It was sitting in some castle, all rusted out.
Look...
It's beautiful.
What is it?
Wait and see.
What great dwarfs!
So you're a young lady who knows about dwarfs, aren't you?
Watch the clockface... if it works.
A fairy!
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.
All right.
A princess?
That's right.
Are they in love?
But they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarfs.
She's a fairy when the clock strikes 12.
Then she turns back into a sheep.
But he appears every hour... and waits for her.
The artisan who made this must have been disappointed in love.
That's why they both look so sad...
This clock's fast, isn't it?
Only about five minutes, though.
Oh, no!
I've got to be at the library!
Can I come back sometime?
Sure... but go left to get to the library!
I'm right above it!
TENSHU HILL What a find!
A place where stories start!
Fantastic!
Tsukishima!
Shizuku Tsukishima!
Isn't this yours?
You're forgetful, aren't you?
Thanks... but how...
Guess!
The cat!
Is that your cat?
You sure eat a big lunch!
No!
Concrete roads, everywhere It's not mine!
Hey!
Oh, here you are...
What's wrong with you?
It's hard to explain.
I felt like I'd found a treasure hidden in a cave.
Then what someone said buried me alive.
Sounds complicated.
Getting more books?
Seven more to go.
Still at it?
What about lunch?
I'll buy something.
You will?
Thanks, then.
June 16th...
Wow!
Amasawa's read this one, too!
What's he like?
Concrete road No!
He's not you!
POE OF HAMBURG Shizuku!
Hurry!
I'm late!
Pass my umbrella.
Rain every day this term!
At least you're studying because you want to.
Sorry.
Study hard!
Don't you worry!
Shizuku!
Hi!
Hurry!
We'll be late!
I hate all these tests!
One every day!
Did you answer the letter?
No.
Did he say anything?
I'm going to say no.
Yeah?
Maybe that's best.
Sugimura!
Better hurry!
I know!
Time's up.
Gather the papers.
See you this afternoon.
Come over here, let's eat!
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.
Let me go to the teachers' room first.
Sure.
Tsukishima!
What?
I lucked out on the test!
Isn't that nice?
Everything I studied was on it!
So you're not just a baseball goof...
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?
With Harada?
Hey, Sugimura!
What?
Did you see this?
Come on!
Stop trying to hook me up!
Was it obvious?
I never just guess!
Sorry!
TEACHER'S ROOM Excuse me...
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.
Oh...
FAIRYTALE DONATED AMASAWA'S COLLECTION That's Dr.
Amasawa.
I've read it.
It's a good book!
Yes, very.
What kind of person is he?
He was chairman of the PTA a few years ago.
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?
His given name?
Mr.
Kimura, do you remember Dr.
Amasawa's first name?
Dr.
Amasawa?
It was Koichi.
Koichi Amasawa...
His youngest son, Tsukishima, is in your year.
Don't you know him?
He is?
Thank you very much!
Excuse us!
Sorry!
Shizuku, where are you going?
What a surprise!
Tell me about it!
What's up with you?
Sorry!
Hey, where are you going?
He ignored me!
The nerve of this guy!
Who is he?
Where are you going?
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!
Oh, you're so cute!
I've been carrying her lunch all over town!
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?
Looks like springtime has come for Shizuku at last!
It isn't true!
You met a prince from one of your books?
Is he handsome?
I just want to find out what he's like!
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!
Yuko!
It happened too fast. "Ma", something, "Masaki", maybe...
Hmm?
Hmm...
But it's just like Tsukishima to run out without hearing the end of something.
You want to know, but you don't...
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!
How terribly romantic!
Should you really tease a girl who has just written your lyrics?
You've finished them?
Let's see!
O Shizuku!
O great poet!
We shall not transgress again!
All right, then.
I'm not sure...
I don't know about old home towns, so I wrote about what I feel.
This is great!
Country road, this old road If I go right to the end Got a feeling it'll take me To that town, country road This is good, Shizuku.
I like it.
It's not hard to sing?
We'll manage.
We can give this to the juniors and sing it to the teachers!
There, too?
Slow down!
I like this part. "I left because I was alone and I had nothing... "Pushed away my sadness and pretended I was strong..." Ladies, the bell.
Yes.
The sun's come out!
Shizuku!
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.
No, I'm going to the library.
There's another test tomorrow...
I'll study there.
Bookworm!
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Harada...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's closed.
Have these flowers been watered?
Baron's gone...
Maybe someone bought him.
WORLD EMPORIUM SHIRO NISHI, PROP "Shiro Nishi"...
Maybe that jerk's name is "Nishi", too.
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
Yuko's on the phone!
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.
Yuko?
What?
I can't hear you.
I'll be there in a minute.
Bye.
Where are you going?
Not far.
What's wrong?
Shizuku!
What's the matter?
What am I going to do?
The guy who wrote the letter got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!
Uh-oh...
Why you, of all people?
Hey!
That guy is so dense!
But he doesn't know how you feel about him...
I'll apologize to him.
But I can't go to school tomorrow looking like this.
And miss the test?
Yeah.
Oh.
DEVELOPMENT Idiot!
What?
It was easy.
The library again, Shizuku?
I'm going to Yuko's.
Say hello.
Bye.
Bye.
Tsukishima!
Wait up!
About Harada...
And then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?
She said, "Why you, of all people," didn't she?
Yeah.
A guy on the baseball team asked me.
No!
She didn't want to hear something like that from you!
Don't you understand?
No, I don't!
Tell me!
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!
What?
No way!
I don't need this!
You don't?
How do you think Yuko feels?
She stayed home sick today!
But...
I like you!
What?
Don't make jokes at a time like this!
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!
Not me!
You can't!
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?
I don't have a boyfriend...
But...
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Tell me the truth!
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...
I'm sorry.
I can't say what I mean.
Just friends?
Forever?
I see...
I'm the one who's dense!
The parcel delivery guy left this with me.
Thank you... again!
You don't have to do this!
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.
Oh, you're home...
Shizuku?
Hi.
Have you been shut out, too?
Do you live here?
Are you hungry?
You're not very nice.
Just like me.
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...
Books don't even excite me like they used to.
There's always someone inside me saying, "Things aren't that easy!" I'm not very nice.
Hey!
Tsukishima!
Moon lets you pet him?
Moon, you're not coming in?
Is that his name?
He's like a full moon.
That's why I call him that.
Isn't he yours?
He won't stay in one house.
I heard some neighbors named him "Ball." I'm sure he has other names.
So he does the rounds...
Yes!
He commutes, on the train!
The train?
Yes, by himself!
That's how I found this place.
I followed him.
And he brought me to a neat store, just like out of a story.
I insulted him.
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.
You're not like Moon at all!
He's half-devil, he is.
Um...
Would you...
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...
He's fine.
It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.
I'm glad he's all right.
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?
That cat statue?
You want to see it?
Come on.
Close the door.
It's like we're in the sky!
Afraid of heights?
No, I like high places.
This is great.
This is the time it looks best.
In here.
Perfect timing.
Sit there.
The clock's gone!
The one that was there?
Grandpa's delivering it today.
Did he sell it?
It was just here for a repair job.
I wanted to see it again.
It took three years.
He finished it the day you forgot your lunch.
That lunch!
I know it wasn't yours.
Look into the cat's eyes.
Quick, before the sun sets.
Engelzimmer... "angel's room".
The artisan accidentally scratched it.
It's beautiful.
Baron won't go anywhere.
He's a treasure.
A treasure?
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.
Turn on the light if you want.
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.
Sometimes I really want to see you...
You look sad today, somehow...
Had enough?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Are you making a violin?
Uh, yeah.
Can I see?
It fits like this.
You made all that?
By hand?
Sure!
Amazing!
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.
The sound comes from the craftsman's skill.
You made all those?
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.
But one of them is yours?
Yeah.
Which one?
That one.
This one?
Wow!
You made this?
It's like magic!
How can you say this with a straight face?
Why?
It's what I think.
Anyone can do that.
I've got a long way to go.
You can play, can't you?
A little.
Play for me, okay?
Please!
Listen...
Please, please, please!
You have to sing, too.
Me?
I'm tone-deaf!
Perfect!
Sing.
You know this song.
Had a dream of living on my own With no fear of being all alone Pushed my sadness down inside of me And pretended I was strong as I could be Country road, this old road If you go right to the end Got a feeling it'll take me To that town, country road It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be I will never ever let A tear show in my eye If my feet are moving faster That's because I only want to push away memories Country road, this old road Could go right to my home town I won't go there, I can't go there Can't go down that country road Country road, when tomorrow comes I'll be like I always am Want to go back there Can't go back there Fare thee well Country road That was fun!
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.
I was hoping you'd come back again.
These are my musical friends.
Nice singing.
You're the lucky one who was there when he fixed the clock...
Seiji has some pretty friends. "Seiji"?
Are you Seiji Amasawa?
Yeah... didn't I tell you my name?
No!
It says "Nishi" outside.
That's Grandpa's name.
I'm Amasawa.
Oh, no!
First I was buried alive, and now the sky's fallen!
What difference does it make what my name is?
A lot!
You've been calling me by my full name!
You never asked me mine!
I never had the chance!
My image of Seiji Amasawa...
What? was someone quiet and gentle.
You read too many books.
So do you!
That was fun.
They're nice people.
Come back.
They'll like that.
Just to listen, then.
Singing's too hard.
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?
Lots of people are as good as I am.
What I want to do is make violins.
Yeah... you're good at that.
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.
I want to go there.
And not go to high school?
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.
It must be great to know what you want to do.
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.
Even if I go, I won't know if I have the talent until I try.
I'll see you home.
No, it's not far.
See you.
Tsukishima...
Yeah?
You've got a talent for poetry.
What you sang back there was fine, but I liked "Concrete Roads", too.
You told me to forget that!
Did I say that?
Yes!
I did?
Thanks for everything.
Good night.
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.
When did you decide on your future?
What?
Your future!
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?
I don't mean that!
I'm in college trying to figure it out.
Good night.
Good night.
Mom's class is canceled so now she sleeps in!
Morning!
Morning!
Run faster!
You go ahead!
HOUR 1: SPARE PERIOD Great!
Shizuku!
You look awful!
You sure got better quickly!
I hear you were out with a boy last night.
Who told you that?
A little bird... who said you were like lovers.
We are not!
Harada...
I'll tell my friend the answer's no.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
That's okay.
Did you see Ninja Warrior on TV last night?
It was great!
This formula will be on the mid-term, so remember it!
What?
Are you serious?
That's all.
I'm not surprised.
I heard he rushed to get it.
Is Tsukishima here?
Amasawa?
What do you want?
Is Tsukishima in this class?
Tsukishima?
Yeah, she's here.
Tsukishima!
You've got a visitor!
A boy!
There she is.
Seiji?
Can I talk to you?
Yes!
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!
Boyfriend!
Boyfriend!
No, I don't!
What is it?
I'm going to Italy.
What?
Come with me.
Where are we going?
The roof!
Wow!
We can't talk with all those people around.
Sorry.
I wanted to tell you first.
Let them think what they want.
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.
What's that?
I apprentice in a workshop there for two months.
Apprentice?
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have the talent or not... and if I have the patience to stick it out.
Otherwise I'll go to high school.
I hate that they're leaving an escape route... but it's a good opportunity.
When are you leaving?
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad will be talking to the school today.
Soon, then...
Great!
Your dream's coming true.
Well, I'll do the best I can.
Um...
Well...
The rain's stopping.
Yeah...
Look over there.
There might be a rainbow...
What's Cremona like?
I hope it's nice.
It's an old town, with lots of violin makers.
It's great.
You're on your way.
I feel like a fool.
I was hoping we'd go to the same high school...
What a stupid thing to think...
Found them!
I saw your name on the library cards a long time ago.
We passed each other all the time in the library.
I even sat next to you.
I read all kinds of books so my name would be on the cards before yours.
I...
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.
Me too.
Don't push!
Hey!
Look out, she's mad!
So scary!
Run!
Here.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Finished already?
I'm meeting Yuko.
If you're by the station, get some milk.
What?
You're the one who drinks it all!
She's slacking off these days.
Did I make you skip cram school?
It's all right.
My head's in a whirl.
Hello, Shizuku.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I'll make some tea.
Okay.
Dad and I aren't speaking.
Boys are so lucky!
When he comes back to graduate, he'll leave again for ten years!
That's like forever!
But it's like fate brought you together!
Cool!
It was too good to last.
Two people who read the same books... except one's moving forward while the other stays behind.
Yeah...
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.
She said he was hard to get to know, but good-looking and smart.
Don't tell me that, will you!
I just feel worse!
Why?
He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you so!
Now I'm not so sure...
I don't get it.
I'd write every day...
We'd support each other...
You can't say "go for it" to someone who's more ambitious than you.
Maybe...
But I don't understand what you want.
Can't you be in love without your future planned out?
You're talented.
All the juniors liked your translation of "Country Roads".
You can express yourself, too...
Unlike me. "Lots of people are as good as I am." What?
That's what he said.
He's going to find out if he's talented enough.
Well, so will I!
I'll write a story!
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.
But it's exam time...
I don't care.
Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.
You going?
Yeah.
Good night.
Say "hi" to your mother.
Yes.
You go for it, too.
I'm sure Sugimura will realize how great you are.
Bye.
Bye.
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!
Moon?
Muta?
Mom!
Muta's gone again!
Muta! "Muta"... "WHISPER OF THE HEART" LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE WOODS LISTEN TO THE FOREST'S VOICE...
Baron as the hero?
Would you mind?
I ask because Seiji says you treasure him...
You didn't have to ask!
Of course you can.
But on one condition.
Yes?
That you let me be the first person to read your story.
Um...
All right?
Do I have to?
I don't know if I can write it or not...
It's the same for a craftsman.
Don't expect perfection at first.
Here, let me show you something.
This.
Look at it.
It's called "mica slate".
Look at the seam.
Like that...
It's beautiful!
It's called "beryl".
You find it in emerald ore.
Emerald?
The gem?
Yes.
You and Seiji are like this stone.
Rough, unpolished, still natural.
I like stones that way.
But making violins and writing stories is different.
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.
It takes time and effort.
You see the ore that makes up most of that stone?
Yes.
You could polish that, but what you'd get would be worthless.
The smaller part inside is purer.
There might even be a better stone deep inside where we can't see.
I'm sorry.
Old people like to preach.
I'm scared.
What if there isn't a beautiful crystal in me?
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.
Thank you.
I'll look forward to it.
A rough stone...
Lapis lazuli...
Let us go forth together... in search of the treasure of lapis lazuli!
Have no fear.
Space is deformed on the night of the new moon.
Faraway things loom large, nearby things look small.
Fly!
We will rise on the updraft.
Make haste!
The planetoids are converging!
Good!
We're riding the wind!
Straight up to that castle!
It's so high!
It's not so high once you're there!
Go!
When the air currents mingle in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!
ARCHITECTURE MANUFACTURING Huh?
NATURE FOLKLORE That's unusual!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction.
PYRITE AGATE JADE LEAD CAT FOLKLORE HISTORY OF EASTERN EUROPE WHEN HE WAS IMPRISONED He's making a violin in his cell...
Seiji!
I thought you were gone!
Grandpa said I might find you here.
I leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.
Sorry I can't walk you home.
That's okay.
I'm glad you came.
I can't come to the airport, but I'll wait for you.
It's only two months.
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.
I'll see you, then.
Have a good trip!
Luisa, my betrothed, and I were born in a distant land.
In that town, magic still lived... and in the veins of its artisans flowed the blood of sorcerers.
It was a doll maker's apprentice who fashioned us... but Luisa and I were happy... because he had made us so we could love others.
But then...
Shizuku...
Shizuku!
Shizuku!
What's going on?
Tsukishima!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
Pay attention!
This is important!
Sorry, sir.
Harada, you read.
Yes.
You were up until four again?
It's okay.
I'm not sleepy at all.
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...
I was thinking.
I've got to organize what I want to write.
I'm not hungry.
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 18TH Shizuku?
So you are home...
Turn on the lights!
At least you could bring in the laundry!
Shizuku!
Come here!
Shizuku's here, isn't she?
She's not hungry.
Thank you for coming.
Sorry to trouble you.
This way...
Is anyone in the guidance office?
Yeah.
Please.
I'm back!
Hello.
You're home early, Shiho.
I'm beat!
Want some coffee?
Yes, please.
Mom, can I talk to you?
What?
I'm thinking of moving out.
I've found a place.
But can you afford it?
I've saved from my job.
I found another one at a cram school.
I'll get by.
I guess I've made you help me out too much around here.
I'll talk to your father.
You will?
Great!
Money's tight till I graduate in the spring and get working... but I'll help you out then.
Sounds good.
I'm sorry I'm doing this now during your master's thesis...
Thanks.
You helped me enough with the data.
And Shizuku will be able to concentrate in her own room.
She's acting weird.
You think so too?
The school called me.
Look at this.
What is it?
She's gone down a hundred spots!
She's at her desk all the time... what's she doing?
Good evening.
Hello.
Excuse me.
What high school will take you with grades like this?
I'm not going to high school!
Use your head!
You think a junior high education is enough?
I can decide my own future!
Watch your mouth!
Face the facts!
The school will write the report after the second term!
You're a fine one to talk!
You didn't study!
You just work part-time jobs!
I do what I have to!
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?
I've got something more important to do!
Like what?
Tell me.
Shiho, Shizuku... that's enough.
But Dad... listen to this girl!
Both of you come out here and tell me about it.
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.
Come on.
MID-TERM TEST RESULTS 3RD YEAR, CLASS 5, SHIZUKU TSUKISHIMA I see.
Is it true what Shiho says?
I do care about my grades!
You just said you weren't going to high school.
You said I wouldn't get into one!
Shiho... can Shizuku and I talk alone for a bit?
Yes.
Where's your mother?
At the Tanakas.
I'm back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your dad back?
Yeah.
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.
Coming.
All right, Shizuku...
Is what you're doing now more important than studying?
Can you tell me what it is?
When it's time.
Is this something you have to do right away?
I've only got three weeks left to do it!
I'm challenging myself.
I have to.
Challenging yourself?
How?
How will we know if you won't tell us?
Is it something you can't even tell us?
Seiya!
Oh... sorry.
Whatever you're doing at the library, I admire how hard you're working.
Let's let her do what she wants.
Not everyone has to be the same.
I should know that more than anyone...
Okay, Shizuku, do what you believe in.
But it's not easy when you walk your own road.
You've only got yourself to blame.
And join us at mealtimes, all right?
Yeah.
We're a family.
Yes.
Call Shiho.
I'll make some tea.
Shizuku...
I know what Dad said, but what he really wants is for you to study.
I know.
It's written on his face.
I'm moving out next Sunday.
You'll have your own room.
You're leaving home?
Yep.
So smarten up!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Only one is real.
Which one is the real one?
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Luisa... you've finally come... but I've grown so old...
Shizuku...
Come in...
I was fast asleep.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.
It's finished?
I promised you'd be the first to read it.
It's a novel! "WHISPER OF THE HEART" Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.
But you've worked so hard on it... shouldn't I take my time?
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...
My heart's pounding...
I see.
I'll read it right now.
Come sit by the fire.
It's cold.
Now we won't be bothered.
Can I wait downstairs?
It's okay.
I'm not cold at all.
Of course... but...
Are you sleeping?
Shizuku...
I'm finished.
Thank you.
It's very good.
It's not!
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!
Yes... it's rough, blunt, unfinished... just like Seiji's violin.
You've shown me the rough stone you've just cut out of the rock.
You've worked hard.
You're wonderful.
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.
It's cold out here.
Come inside.
Now...
Now that I've written it I get it.
Wanting isn't enough.
I have to learn more... but Seiji's getting further and further ahead.
I felt that I had to force myself to write, and I was so scared...
You like Seiji, don't you?
How does it taste?
It's very good.
When Seiji finished his first violin, we had ramen noodles.
Jumbo size.
Thank you.
Now, where was I?
You found Baron in a coffee shop...
Yes, in Germany...
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...
I asked the owner to sell him to me.
But he wouldn't.
Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.
He was waiting for her to come back while she was being repaired... at the doll maker's shop.
Just like in my story!
Yes... quite the coincidence!
I had to go back to Japan, so I'd just about given up.
Then a lady friend of mine... told me that when the other doll came back, she would pick it up... so the two dolls could be reunited.
So the owner gave in.
I ended up leaving Germany with just Baron.
I promised her I'd come back, and asked her to keep the other doll.
The day the dolls met again... would be the day we'd be reunited.
But then the war started, and I couldn't keep my promise.
When I was finally able to go back, I looked all over for her.
But there was no trace of her, or the Baron's lover.
She must have been very dear to you...
Your story brought the Baron out of my memory and back to life.
Oh, yes...
Hold out your hand.
But...
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.
Now, finish up your story.
Yes.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
I'm home.
Hi.
Where's Dad?
In his bath.
Where were you at this hour?
I'm sorry I worried you.
Today I'm back to studying for my entrance exams.
So your challenge is over?
For now.
Did you eat?
There's curry...
I'm fine! "For now"...
Shizuku, the bathroom's free.
Ah, the warrior rests.
There we go.
No!
Wait there!
It's a miracle!
You're here!
We're not dreaming?
I got an earlier flight.
Hop on.
Wait... you'll be cold.
Climb on.
I'll get a coat.
No time!
Get on.
Hang on tight.
I was out there calling you in my head. "Shizuku!" And then you appeared!
What a team!
Me, too... it's like I'm still dreaming!
How was Cremona?
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.
It's getting light!
Shall I get off?
It's all right.
I made up my mind I was going to take you all the way up this hill!
That's not fair!
I'm no man's burden!
I want to be useful!
Okay!
Push!
Almost there!
Shizuku!
Hop on!
We made it!
I'll hold the coat.
I'm fine.
Here...
Wow!
In the mist, it looks just like the sea!
This is my secret spot.
It's almost time.
I wanted you to see this.
Grandpa told me everything.
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.
No... you were the reason I did it.
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.
I'm going to study hard and go on to high school.
Listen, Shizuku...
I can't say how soon it'll be, but... would you marry me?
I'm going to be a violin maker... and then...
You mean it?
That's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah?
Great!
Wait... it's cold...
Shizuku...
I love you!
Had a dream of living on my own With no fear of being all alone Pushed my sadness down inside of me And pretended I was strong as I could be Country road, this old road If you go right to the end Got a feeling it'll take me To that town, country road Tired of walking, I stop and stand Thinking back on my hometown But that road leading up the hill Is telling me to move on Country road, this old road If you go right to the end Got a feeling it'll take me To that town Country road It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be I'll never ever let a tear show in my eye If my feet are moving faster That's because I only want to push away memories Country road, this old road Could go right to my home town I won't go there, I can't go there Can't go down that country road Country road, when tomorrow comes I'll be like I always am Want to go back there, can't go back there Fare thee well Country road

Good morning.
Is Sora up yet?
Still in front of the mirror.
Good morning.
Morning.
Night shift again?
And tonight too.
Shall I save dinner for you?
Yes, thanks.
That's real service.
The hospital's short-handed.
I got a hole in my sock!
Leave it by the sewing machine.
More holes?
My socks keep shrinking.
This is for you.
Pack me a jumbo lunch.
Don't you eat enough already?
Here Riku, have my fried egg.
All right!
You need it more, Dr.
Hokuto.
Who's the doctor here?
You drown everything in soy sauce.
I like it that way.
Me too.
Breakfast is ready, Hiro.
Good morning, Hana.
Good morning.
You can share your mother's.
Thanks.
Can I make you some tea?
No thanks, I've had some.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Thanks.
Please go ahead, everyone.
Let's eat!
You're late.
I can't get my hair right.
You look very pretty.
I'm starving.
Evening rounds again, Dr.
Hokuto?
Yes.
I don't know how you keep up this pace.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Good morning, Tomoko.
Morning.
Need a lift?
Thanks, I'll walk.
Suit yourself.
Can you hang the laundry?
Of course.
See you this afternoon.
Bye, then.
Wait up.
KONAN ACADEMY There she is.
Morning.
Look what's in the school paper.
There's a poem about you.
Who else raises flags every morning?
FAIR GIRL, WHY DO YOU SEND YOUR THOUGHTS TO THE SKY?
THE WIND CARRIES THEM ALOFT TO MINGLE WITH THE CROWS TRIMMED WITH BLUE YOUR FLAGS FLY AGAIN TODAY See?
It must be about you.
I guess.
So it's about you.
Try a note in a bottle next time.
Back off Math Club creep!
He practically lives at the clubhouse.
That's right.
All rise!
We grabbed a table.
See you there.
Who ordered the curry noodles?
Nobuko, over here!
I'm famished.
What, curry udon again?
Why not?
I like it.
Anyway, you're one to talk.
So?
I like bread.
Umi's lunches look so good.
You should try making your own.
I could, I just don't have enough time.
What are those guys up to now?
And...up!
One, two.
One, two.
One, two...
All right, drop the banners.
LATIN QUARTER ANTI-DEMOLITION LEAGUE It ripped!
Go.
Go for it!
Look this way, you guys.
That was cool.
Are you okay?
So stupid...
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Thanks, Tomoko.
My pleasure.
That should do it.
Today's fish was really cheap.
Thanks.
I think I'll deep fry it.
I have to see Grandmother.
Grandmother?
It's me.
Come in.
In the black again this month.
You're managing things beautifully.
Only because you're covering Tomoko's wages for us.
It's nothing.
I'd have hired her anyway, even without the boarders.
But isn't this too much work for you?
I worry sometimes.
It doesn't feel so lonely with everyone here.
I know.
But still...
It makes me so sad, watching you raise those flags every day.
No one knows how much you miss your father.
I hope you find someone wonderful soon.
Then you won't need those flags anymore.
Mrs.
Matsuzaki?
Come in.
I'm finished for the day.
Thank you, Tomoko.
I should get dinner going.
That was quite a stunt.
No kidding.
Some of the girls are even starting a fan club.
What's his name?
Shun Kazama.
He's a live wire.
The electrician's son?
Hiro, you're so dense. ‘Fair girl, why do you send Your thoughts to the sky?’ Thus the Principality of Wallachia was hemmed in... by the Ottoman Turks and Russia, and its territory was coveted by both.
SAVE OUR CLUBHOUSE FROM DEMOLITION Umi!
Sora?
What's going on?
I bought this for 30 yen. 30 yen just for that?
Isn't he cool?
I've got to have his autograph.
Please come with me.
I've never been inside the clubhouse.
Neither have I.
I'm not going in there.
Please!
No way.
Come on, just this once.
Come on...
It goes without saying that the Constitutional Party must take responsibility for their words.
Especially in this era of political cabinets, it is their duty to implement the policies which they promised to the people before they were appointed.
Ready?
By doing so, the cabinet will be fulfilling its purpose.
Excuse me?
Today's spots are very distinct!
And they form a straight line.
A textbook magnetic field.
Excuse me.
What?
We're looking for the school newspaper office.
Third floor, same room as the Archaeology Club.
Thanks. ...losing all their trust.
They proclaim all sorts of policies, but if you take a better look at them, you will find that these so-called policies are meaningless and empty.
Don't they ever clean this place?
They have neither the sincerity nor the passion to implement any of them!
If you disagree with my observations, it doesn't matter who you are...
SENIOR MATH CLUB Hey.
Hi, we're looking for the Archaeology Club.
Upstairs.
Look for the Lit Club sign.
Thanks.
I THINK, THEREFORE I AM At last, inquiring minds!
The Philosophy Club wants you.
New members!
How long has it been?
My struggle was not in vain.
We're just heading for the Archaeology Lit Club, actually.
Now don't be shy.
Shall we discuss existentialism?
Or perhaps you prefer Nietzsche?
Chem Club!
How dare you disturb our contemplation?
Better run, you guys.
You'll be there all day.
Show some respect, you second-rate alchemists.
At least we do experiments.
Your ideas can't even be proved. ‘New poets!
Draw energy from clouds, light, storms...’ ‘Show us the direction humanity should take...’ ‘A Copernicus for a new age, to set us free...’ CQ!
CQ!
This is a high school student from Japan.
LITERATURE CLUB LATIN QUARTER WEEKLY This is it.
Matsuzaki.
Yamazaki...
Hey, Shun!
Couple of VIPs to see you.
Welcome to the Lit Club.
Or was it the Archaeology Club?
Don't tell me you're here about that rag we publish.
Knock it off, Mizunuma.
Come in and close the...
They'll shut us down!
We're down to two members.
The Archaeology Club is doomed.
Can you sign this?
Do it for her, hero.
Thank you!
Your hand...
Just a cat scratch.
This isn't from the jump.
A cat...?
Wait, could you cut some stencils for Shun?
We're all pretty busy with the anti-demolition campaign.
You're the little sister?
Yes, I'm Sora Matsuzaki.
You help them, Umi.
My handwriting is terrible.
You're joking.
Why should I...
PHYSICS MIDTERM FORECAST!
You're a junior.
Got Suzuki for physics?
Suzuki?
Yes.
Then you need this.
Mizunuma's exam forecasts are usually spot on.
But not guaranteed.
Bring your own luck to the test.
See you at six.
Shall we go?
Oh, yes!
Miss Matsuzaki, I'd better see you out.
Our resident philosopher might ambush you.
Oh, thank you!
From here to the end.
NEW DICTIONARY FRENCH - JAPANESE We've got to do something.
Yes, for the honor of those who went before us!
THE KONAN NEWSPAPER LATIN QUARTER FREEDOM TO GROW OUT OUR HAIR!
THE KONAN NEWSPAPER WHAT THE NEW GENERATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE Meeting, Shun.
Care to join us, Matsuzaki?
It's the anti-demolition meeting.
Is it that late?
I finished.
Thanks, that really helps.
Meeting!
All hands on deck.
Time for today's meeting.
I'm home.
Hi, Umi.
I'm running late.
Let's do curry.
Can you cut the vegetables?
Sure.
I'm back.
We were waiting.
Riku, I need some pork.
Can you run down for me?
What, right now?
Sora?
But the program just started.
You didn't ask Tomoko to get some?
I used it for lunches.
Start the rice in 10 minutes, okay?
Okay.
Shopping?
Sort of.
Hop on.
Bottom of the hill, right?
Don't worry, my hand's okay.
I can use the brake just fine.
How was your meeting?
Still going strong.
But I've got curfew.
Did you finish printing the paper?
You must be kidding.
I'll do it tomorrow before school.
Listen, Shun.
Can I ask you something?
That poem in the paper...
You were saying?
No, it's okay.
Thanks. 400 grams of sliced pork.
Two to go.
Thank you.
Here you go. 240 yen.
Here.
Thank you.
Come again.
Thanks.
Dig in.
I need energy to get home.
Where's your house?
By the harbor.
Gosh, that's far.
See you.
Thank you!
This is nice.
Can I come in?
Don't you feel well?
Go on ahead, Sora.
I'm coming in.
Wow...
I shouldn't paint at night.
The colors are all wrong.
It's beautiful.
What's this?
That tug goes by a lot.
I think it's answering your flags.
Guess you can't see the tug from there.
Answering my message?
I need food.
Good morning.
Good morning.
All printed up.
Your handwriting's great.
Thanks.
Listen...
Can I help with anything else?
Of course.
But I can't stay late.
I'll give you some stencils.
You can transfer copy at home.
Thanks.
There's a debate after school.
Why don't you come?
Sorry, I'm busy today.
Bye.
Umi, wait!
Let's get ice cream.
No club meeting?
It was canceled for the debate.
Sorry, Tomoko's off today.
I have to be back early.
Come on everybody, the debate's starting.
Come on everybody...
THE LATIN QUARTER SHOULD BE PRESERVED!
Good, hold it right there.
This'll get rough.
Afternoon.
Heading home?
Got some nice flounder fillets.
Okay, I'll take some.
Your mom back yet?
Not yet.
I'll come back later!
What's going on?
We've had peace for nearly 10 years.
The Olympics are coming soon.
It's a whole new era.
Japan is changing radically.
We must build a new society on the ruins of the old.
A new democracy!
Tearing down the Latin Quarter and building a new clubhouse is a historical necessity.
And the students want it.
Umi!
What's happening?
I don't know exactly.
We surveyed the students about the new clubhouse. 80 percent of the student body want to rebuild.
I believe we must accept the board's plan!
You're like the old men who run this country... just blindly following the crowd.
Silence!
I have the floor.
Who cares about percentages when you're wrong?
Blockheads!
Wait your turn!
Is this the tyranny of the majority?
You can't grasp the meaning of democracy.
Want to demolish something?
Demolish your own heads.
I have the floor!
Destroy the old and you destroy our memory of the past.
Don't you care about the people who lived and died before us?
There's no future for people... who worship the future and forget the past.
Democracy doesn't mean you can ignore the minority.
Throw the anarchists out!
Scrum!
Eject them!
Stand fast, men!
Get off the stage.
You're history!
Yeah!
Do something, chairman!
We won't back down!
A white flower was blooming That day long ago In my homeland far away When at last we parted You looked away And didn't say a word I remember your long braids And the sadness in my heart As that white flower bloomed And the sadness in my heart As that white flower bloomed So what did you think?
It was amazing.
Everybody's so passionate.
Debates are always like that.
Most everyone thinks the clubhouse should go.
Mizunuma's fighting a losing battle.
You think?
Maybe you could clean the place up.
It's old, but it's such a nice building.
Make it like new again.
Invite the girls to come see it.
Then they'll get it.
Maybe you're right.
But the guys think all that dust is part of history.
The physics midterm forecast was a big hit.
Everybody's waiting for the math forecast.
Me too.
Thanks.
You've been a big help.
See you soon.
So long.
Umi!
Thanks.
Oh no...the fish! ...then everyone started singing.
The teachers were totally fooled.
It sounds like nothing's changed since I graduated.
Your president Mizunuma is my classmate's little brother.
Was his brother a genius too?
Sister.
She's an astrophysicist.
Wow...
What's all the excitement in here?
Great idea.
This is the best.
I'll slice some cheese.
Can I taste it?
Sorry, too young.
Umi, why don't we invite some Konan graduates... to my farewell party?
Who?
You know...the guys.
Guys?
Hey.
H -O -K -U -T...
Hokuto.
You read signal flags?
The gate's open.
Coming.
Why not get married and start a practice right here?
We'd have to move out!
You'll be married by then.
I'd better start looking.
Bet you find a real nice guy.
You're the best.
The trustees are the problem.
The principal's a good guy.
He goes where the wind blows.
The chairman's an old fox.
When's the principal going to quit?
I think we can handle them, but we need a strategy.
Even with a strategy, what can we actually do?
We need more glasses.
I'll wash some.
Here, take this out.
All right.
The sushi's here.
Finally!
This building is 60 years old.
It used to be a hospital.
My great-grandfather loved cats.
Compared to the clubhouse, it looks like it was built yesterday.
You really take good care of it.
So I guess your dad must've been a doctor too?
No, he was a ship captain.
From this valley They say you are going We will miss your bright eyes And your smile Far from us You are taking the sunshine So your mom married a sailor.
Grandma and Grandpa were totally against it.
They tried to stop her.
So Mom ran away and they eloped.
I bet that took guts.
I heard your mom's a professor.
And the signal flags...
Your dad taught you?
Yes, when I was little.
He said they helped him find his way back to us.
So I raised them every day.
I'd raise them from the balcony until his ship docked again.
I never missed a day.
Then his ship sank in the Korean War.
And that was that.
But I never stopped raising those flags.
After I moved here, I wouldn't stop crying.
There was nowhere to raise Dad's flags.
So Grandpa built me that flagpole.
I'll open the curtains.
This used to be Grandpa's office.
Now it's my mom's study.
It looks like a library.
This is your family?
Yes.
Your father?
That's Grandpa.
My dad's right there.
Isn't he handsome?
That's when they got married.
This is the picture I really like.
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO, TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO Yuichiro Sawamura...?
That's my dad.
Matsuzaki is my mom's name.
Come on, it's speech time.
We better go down.
I'm back.
You're late.
You'll worry your mother.
Shun, what about dinner?
I already ate.
He swings...Nagashima strikes out!
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO, TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO Yuichiro Sawamura...
Thanks for coming.
What's going on?
Welcome, volunteers.
The Latin Quarter is all yours.
You have our deepest thanks... for helping us to preserve this magnificent cultural landmark.
Remember, men.
The heavy lifting is up to you.
Let's do it!
My shrine to Reason!
No exceptions, that's the rule.
Okay, ready.
Here we go.
Ready...
Be careful, will you?
Hey, watch it! 1st Year Math...2nd Year Math...
These are old exams.
We use those for forecasts.
Here's Dr.
Hokuto's math final.
She got a perfect score.
Take over for me.
We need everything moved.
I'll give you a hand.
Heads up, Matsuzaki.
Sorry.
Mizunuma said to pitch anything we're not sure we need.
It's so filthy.
Didn't you guys ever clean?
Not since I've been here.
We better bring the badminton girls tomorrow.
Please do.
Sora, I'm going now.
Okay.
I'll be home by dinner.
ONE STEP FORWARD Did something happen?
Not a thing.
See you tomorrow.
Dad, can I ask you something?
I'm working.
Make it short.
Yuichiro Sawamura.
He's my real father, right?
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO, TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO We've been over that.
You're my son.
It was blowing hard the night Sawamura brought you.
He had his Family Register with him.
We'd just lost a child of our own.
Next thing I knew, your mother was nursing you.
She wouldn't let you go.
Sawamura was a good sailor.
His supply ship sank during a battle in the Korean War.
Until the end, he helped us out.
You remind me of him more every day.
But you're still our son.
Thanks, Dad.
Is it out there?
Not yet.
Guess it's not coming by today.
THE LATIN QUARTER REBORN!
May I...?
Come in, Umi.
You're really leaving.
Thanks for all your help.
I wish I could see you off.
Go on, I'll be fine.
We'll miss you.
I'll drop by now and then.
You'd better get to school.
Good luck with Shun.
Take care.
Extra, extra!
Extra!
Extra edition of The Latin Quarter Weekly.
We'll need your help today.
Latin Quarter gets a facelift!
Extra, extra!
Here.
I'll be there again today.
Thanks.
Hi.
You're working hard.
Hey, see you there, okay?
Here, Matsuzaki.
Extra, extra!
Extra, extra!
Get your Latin Quarter.
Extra!
Extra!
Next label, please.
Okay.
NI-2 KOKUBUNJI RUINS He's so brave.
This is great.
Let's go look.
KONAN ACADEMY If you don't like me, just say so.
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO, TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO Yuichiro Sawamura.
He's my real father.
It's like some cheap melodrama.
I don't understand.
Dad told me years ago.
I even checked at City Hall.
But then...
We're brother and sister.
What should we do?
We forget whatever it was we felt about each other.
We'll just be friends, like before.
Sora, did something happen to Umi at school?
No, at least I don't think so.
Are you sure?
That dinner tonight was pretty strange.
And she was soaked.
Something must've happened.
She's never come home that late.
Umi, the bath's ready.
Not tonight.
Don't you feel well?
Umi...
Umi...
Umi...
Umi...
Good morning, Umi.
Did you sleep well?
Mom?
When did you come back?
Don't be silly.
I've been here all along.
Umi, I'm hoisting the flags.
Come give me a hand.
Dad...?
I'll be home for a long time.
You're such a big girl now.
Need more supplies?
Just ask this guy.
He's in construction.
Come on, no more freebies.
Why not?
Business is good.
Hope you guys win.
Thank you.
Unbelievable.
We owe this to Dr.
Hokuto.
No, even more to Umi.
She's our goddess of good luck.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
This is practically a construction site.
What are you doing?
Give me that for a sec.
Let me show you how the pros do it.
Incredible!
My dad's a plasterer.
Beautiful...
What's that?
The wall, I mean.
What?
Hey.
That's it for today.
Thanks for staying late.
You don't have to go back?
Sora's covering for me.
Can I help out with anything?
Could you do this?
Can I have two days?
That'll really help, thanks.
See you.
So long.
LATIN QUARTER VISIT THE NEW LATIN QUARTER!
MAJORITY OF GIRLS OPPOSE DEMOLITION!
MIDTERM RESULTS ANNOUNCED TEST FORECAST VINDICATED!
MAJORITY OF ALL STUDENTS OPPOSE DEMOLITION!
Ready, everybody?
Umi, don't go.
Shun, it's bad news.
The board just voted to tear us down.
The principal won't listen to reason.
All our hard work!
They won't even come?
Then they'd have to back down.
Right!
Mob the principal's office!
Let's go straight to the chairman.
Of the Tokumaru Foundation?
He's pretty hard to see.
You guys go see him.
Tell him how it is.
Yes, please go.
Mizunuma, we've got to go to Tokyo.
Please!
Please, Mizunuma!
It's worth a shot.
Umi, we need you too.
Tell him, Umi!
Umi, good luck tomorrow.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Did you skip class?
No, I told them yesterday I'd be absent.
Then we'd better get going.
FOR A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS MAKE TOKYO BEAUTIFUL Let's give it our best shot.
Yes, that's what they say.
No appointment?
We're appealing directly to Mr.
Tokumaru.
Something about a direct appeal.
Yes, students from Konan Academy.
Three of them.
All right.
Take the elevator to the fourth floor and wait there.
Fourth floor.
Don't forget to sign in.
One name is fine.
Are you the Konan students?
Yes.
The president's very busy.
I can't guarantee he'll have time for you.
We're sorry to disturb him.
We didn't think he'd agree to an appointment.
You may just be wasting your time... but please wait here if you like.
We'll wait!
Oh come on, Kimura has the best pastries.
Nakamura's hard to beat.
I can't believe you'd say that.
You don't know your pastries.
Thank you.
It's as plain as the nose on your face.
ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT Come on in, kids.
Thank you.
Excuse us.
Yeah?
Ah, yeah.
Hang on.
Have a seat.
Be with you in a minute.
So you see how it is.
Yes, give him my regards.
Okay.
Bye.
Sit.
Now, why aren't you kids in school?
We escaped.
Escaped?
I did that a lot myself.
You're here about your clubhouse, I suppose.
Yes, we'd like to ask you to come and inspect it yourself.
You're welcome any time.
What year are you?
I'm a junior.
Umi Matsuzaki.
I help out with the school paper.
What do you care about that old shack?
We all love it.
We spent hours making it look new.
Please see for yourself.
You cleaned it up?
What does your father do?
He was a ship captain in the Korean War.
His ship hit a mine.
A supply ship?
Yes.
I see.
It must've been hard for your mother, raising you alone.
She did a fine job.
Thank you.
All right, I'll go.
TRUTH, GOODNESS AND BEAUTY Thank you!
It's me.
What's on tomorrow?
Let's see, that's in the evening.
Move the rest to Friday.
It's settled.
Tomorrow afternoon.
I'll contact your principal and do an official inspection tour.
Some grownups are pretty cool.
Don't count your chickens.
I'm glad we came.
I have to swing by my uncle's place.
See you tomorrow.
What are you doing after graduation?
I can't afford much tuition.
I'll apply to a national university.
What about the Weekly?
I'll find somebody to take over after things are settled.
What about you?
I haven't decided.
I'd like to be a doctor, though.
Are you the one who wrote that poem?
I saw you raising your flags every morning from my dad's tug.
I can't see the tug passing by from the garden.
That's why I never noticed you were answering me.
Shun?
Listen, I...
Those flags were a message to my dad.
I think he sent you to me.
That's what I want to believe.
I'm in love with you, Shun.
Umi...
Even if we're related, even if you're my brother... my feelings will never change.
I feel the same about you.
I'm back.
Let's try it.
Mom!
Umi, I'm home.
Finally!
How was America?
I was busy learning every day.
Any boyfriends yet, Sora?
Not yet.
This is great stuff, Mom.
It's called jerky.
Is it pork?
Hiro, it says beef on the package.
Mom?
You're up pretty late.
I wanted to ask you something.
Ask away, then.
I'm wide awake.
Sorting through these books woke me up even more.
There's this boy at school.
His name is Shun Kazama.
He came for the farewell party.
I showed him Dad's picture.
He had the same photo.
He says his real father is Yuichiro Sawamura.
This one?
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO, TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO I'm afraid this is all a little bit complicated.
I told you about how your father and I eloped.
You remember, don't you?
Our first place was that second-floor apartment.
Yuichiro was away a lot.
I was pregnant with you and working on my degree.
I loved school so much.
I was determined to do well.
Yuichi...
Yuichiro, whose baby is that?
It's Tachibana's boy.
He's ours now.
Tachibana was killed in an accident on a repatriation ship.
His wife died giving birth.
The Bomb killed their relatives.
If we don't register him as ours, he'll end up in an orphanage.
Yuichiro registered the baby as his son and brought him home.
The war had just ended.
It was happening everywhere.
But I was already pregnant.
There was no way I could raise him.
Yuichiro's friend lost a child, so we gave the baby up.
Is he doing well?
I'm so glad.
Your father was so good-hearted.
Maybe just a little impulsive.
Without his help, I couldn't have finished school.
But what if Shun was really Dad's son?
If he was really Yuichiro's son?
I'd like to meet him.
Does he look like this picture?
Umi...
See you tonight.
Have a nice day.
Welcome to the Latin Quarter.
LATIN QUARTER WELCOMES CHAIRMAN TOKUMARU I never realized this building was so impressive.
Thank you, sir.
What are you studying?
Sir!
The Astronomy Club has studied sunspots for 10 years. 10 years?
And what did you discover?
The sun is very old, and our lifespan is short.
No discoveries so far!
Excellent answer.
I THINK, THEREFORE I AM The Philosophy Club?
Wouldn't you like a brand new clubhouse?
What about your junior members?
Sir, we philosophers can be content with just a barrel.
Diogenes!
Very good.
Principal, your students are really quite impressive.
Shun Kazama?
Yes.
Hello, Dad?
The third man in the photo is here.
He can tell you about your father.
His ship leaves at four o'clock.
He won't be back for months.
Get down here!
Should the world sink Beneath the indigo waves Stand fast, sink not Beneath that horizon Stand fast against the flood Like a great range of mountains With pinnacles thrust high Into the winds of the future Should the world sink Beneath the indigo waves Stand fast, sink not Beneath that horizon My friends, you have shown me the Latin Quarter's true value.
How can we educate the young without protecting our culture?
I'll just find a different site for the new building.
All right!
Umi, you did it.
We all did it.
Awesome!
Magnificent!
SENIOR MATH CLUB On to the next experiment.
Umi, we owe this to you.
But I didn't do anything special.
Fixing things up was your idea.
She's right.
Thank you, Umi.
Thank you!
Good for you.
Umi.
Umi!
The perfect couple.
Please excuse them, sir.
Something very important is happening to both of them.
They have to hurry.
Escape...
It's great to be young.
KONAN ACADEMY Shun!
Give us a ride.
Umi?
Don't worry Umi, I'll get you there in time.
We'd better run.
Thanks!
Good luck, Umi.
Come on, Shun.
Hurry!
Thanks.
That's my dad's tug.
Here they are, captain.
Push our departure back 15 minutes.
So you're Tachibana's boy.
And you must be Sawamura's daughter.
Both fine-looking youngsters.
It's Shun, right?
Your father was Hiroshi Tachibana.
Front row, fourth from the right.
You can see Sawamura next to him.
We three were close friends.
Take the seat of honor, Tachibana.
Why me?
You're our leader.
You belong there.
All right, let's do it.
Just don't die before me, okay?
Same goes for you.
Here we go.
I was away at sea when your parents passed on.
Otherwise I'd have done exactly what Sawamura did.
Meeting you two is like seeing my old friends again.
Thank you both.
I've never been so happy.
Across the shining sea, A ship disappears in the sunlight Its horn trails a note of farewell If I walk down that gentle slope Will I feel a breeze the color of summer?
My love is a melody I sing it high and low My love is a seagull That soars and swoops If I call out to you at twilight Will I see you there my sweet?
Swaying branches along the path Leave farewell shadows on the ground Leave farewell shadows on the ground A weather vane rooster, an old chapel Will I see a city Steeped in summer hues?
Yesterday's love is my tears They dry and vanish with time Tomorrow's love is a refrain Words without end If we meet at twilight Will you hold me in your arms?

Pirates!
We're under attack!
Hold them off!
Get down on the floor.
Tear gas!
What are you waiting for?
Break it down!
Where'd she go?
There she is!
She's getting away!
Well, get her!
Mama, don't drop me!
There's the stone.
Quick, go next door!
Get that crystal!
There goes the crystal.
CASTLE IN THE SKY Two meatballs, please.
Working late?
We're finally busy again.
Still working?
Yeah.
What's that?
A person!
Pazu!
What are you up to?
Where's my dinner?
Boss!
A girl fell from the sky.
Boss, she fell from the sky.
Darn old clunker.
Boss!
A girl...
Close valve number two!
Pazu, toss me a wrench.
Sure.
I'm busy here.
You take it.
Don't make them wait.
Yes!
Keep a steady hand.
Yes!
Brake!
Any luck?
No silver, no tin even.
All that wasted work.
Should we try the east vein?
That's riddled with old holes.
We'll have to start over.
That's enough for today.
Push!
Shut down the boiler.
Call it a day.
I'll go under at this rate.
Oil the clunker, Pazu.
Yes!
Mama, we couldn't find her.
It's too dark.
I hope you really looked!
All right.
We'll wait for daylight.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Hey, come on guys...
I'm Pazu.
I live here by myself.
They eat after I play.
So you are human after all.
I was afraid you were an angel.
Thanks for helping me.
I'm Sheeta.
Sheeta, nice name.
You fell from the sky.
A bit scary.
That's right.
Why am I still alive?
I fell from the airship...
Have you forgotten?
Yes.
Say, can I see that?
This?
Yes.
It's been in my family forever.
It's beautiful.
Wait...
Watch this!
Pazu!
So it wasn't the stone after all.
Pazu!
Oh, no!
Pazu!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you?
I'm fine.
Sorry, did it hurt?
No, my head's harder than my boss's fists.
The pot's still boiling.
Hungry?
Let's eat.
Wash up over there.
There's a towel.
Thank you.
Laputa...
Sheeta!
Where are you?
My father took that picture.
That's Laputa, an island in the sky.
An island in the sky?
They say it's only a myth.
But my father saw it.
He took it from an airship.
There's a Laputa in Gulliver's Travels, but Swift made it up.
Dad drew this.
He said the abandoned palace was full of treasure.
But nobody believed him.
Until he died, they called him a liar.
But my father never lied.
I'm building a real plane.
I'm going to find Laputa!
A real automobile...
They're pirates!
They attacked the airship.
Are they after you?
Yes.
Quick!
Morning!
Hey, wait!
We're in a rush.
Have you seen a girl?
Sure, yesterday...
The boss's kid, Madge...
Off you go!
They're looking for you.
Louis, a girl's dress!
What!
She was disguised!
Tell Mama!
All right!
Haven't seen her.
A cute little girl.
Brown hair, braids...
Boss!
Boss!
About that age.
Hey!
That's her!
Pirates!
They're chasing her.
Pirates!
Lemme see!
Not one step closer.
Hand her over.
Pirates, eh?
Dola's clan.
Go home.
Just poor folk here.
Ma'am?
Scoot out the back.
I want to fight.
They've got weapons!
But...
What a pretty girl.
Better protect her.
You refuse to step aside?
Use your fists.
Could be interesting.
Get him, brother.
Show your stuff.
Wow.
Who's going to mend that shirt?
You can beat him!
That's it, hit him!
Off you go!
Think you can fool me?
After them!
Climb on!
There you go.
Playing hooky for a date?
Bad guys are after us.
The Dola clan.
Pirates?
Take us to the next town.
To the police!
You're on.
Stoke the fire.
Okay.
Mama!
You idiots!
Hurry up and get on!
What?
But the girl's...
She slipped out the back door.
Get moving!
Brother!
Wait!
They're catching up, more steam!
Can't you go any faster?
She's an old-timer.
Move over!
Whoa!
Mama, I can't hang on!
More steam, they're gaining on us!
Here we go!
Sheeta, over here.
Stoke the fire.
Okay!
Don't give up!
Push!
Push, I tell you!
Not so fast!
Don't let them escape!
Dump this over the side!
That'll teach them!
I'll do it.
No, let me.
Up we go!
Up we go!
Wait!
It's them.
What'll we do?
I refuse to give up.
Move!
This is a surprise.
If it isn't the army!
These kids need help!
They've got pirates after them.
Sheeta?
Goodbye.
Wait!
Sheeta!
Halt or I'll shoot.
An armored train.
Who cares!
Ram it!
What is it, Sheeta!
Stay away!
They're gonna fall!
Quiet.
Watch closely.
We're floating!
Look!
It's that crystal!
It was the stone after all!
Amazing!
We'll float all the way down.
Amazing!
I want it!
Fire!
I have to get that amazing stone!
It's fading...
Hey, wait!
It's just like when you landed.
The opening looks so tiny.
I hope the boss and the engineer aren't in any trouble.
Aw, don't worry.
Miners aren't exactly wimps.
Come on, let's find the way out.
These mines are ancient.
Tunnels everywhere.
There.
I'm so happy.
I was starving.
I've still got an apple and some candy.
It's like you have a magical bag that holds everything.
Gondoa?
That's so far north.
Yes.
Both my parents died, but they left me the house and the fields, so I was getting by on my own.
Those guys with dark glasses kidnapped you?
Yes.
That guy was one of them?
Who can they be, calling in the army?
Dola and the other guys, they all want the stone.
But I had no idea it had mysterious powers.
It was always in our family.
Mother left it to me when she died.
She warned me never to show it or give it to anyone.
We're both orphans, aren't we?
I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this.
When you fell from the sky my heart was racing.
I knew something wonderful had begun.
Little demons...
Little demons.
Uncle Pom!
He's really great.
Uncle Pom.
We've lost our way.
Now that little demon sure looks like Pazu...
With a little girl demon beside him.
Pirates are after us.
And the army.
How very extraordinary.
Drink up.
Thank you.
Have you always lived underground?
Why, no, no.
The rocks have been stirring...
That's when I like to be down here.
The rocks were stirring?
Rocks speak very softly.
Wonderful...
Pazu, look at that!
They were ordinary rocks until...
How pretty...
Here, let me show you.
It's gone.
These rocks contain volucite.
Volucite?
As soon as it's exposed to the air, it becomes ordinary stone.
It's glowing...
Oh, my gracious!
That's a volucite crystal, my dear.
I've never seen one before.
That's why the rocks were stirring.
This stone has mysterious powers.
I thought only Laputans knew how to make volucite crystals.
Laputans?
They used Volucite to send a magnificent island aloft...
Laputa did exist, Sheeta!
It really did!
Does the island still exist?
Uncle Pom?
Dear, would you mind covering the stone?
Its power overwhelms me.
Yes.
What's wrong?
My grandfather told me... the rocks stir when Laputa floats overhead.
If you went up to the sky then, you'd find Laputa!
Sheeta, my father was telling the truth!
Young lady...
You see...
Yes?
Your stone is most powerful...
I know that.
I've been speaking to rocks all my life.
A stone so powerful brings happiness, but it also often brings misery.
I see.
What's more, your stone is the work of men.
How on earth did you...
The stone's not dangerous!
It already saved Sheeta twice!
Amazing!
Laputa really does exist!
It's gone.
Let's go back to the ship.
When it's this quiet, it's best to stay put.
I'm hungry...
It's all clear.
Let's go.
Thank you, Uncle.
Look after yourselves.
Look at those clouds!
Beyond those clouds is an island we've only dreamed of.
Here I come!
I know I'm going to find Laputa!
Pazu...
I haven't told you everything.
My family had a mysterious, ancient name... that came with this stone.
My name is Lucita, Lucita Toelle Ur....
Laputa.
Laputa?
So you mean...
It's the army!
Run!
Underground!
Don't move!
How dare you!
Pazu!
Let me go!
Pazu!
Pazu!
We've apprehended them.
Good work.
Open up, open up!
Sheeta...
Company, march!
Use force!
Squeeze the brat, she'll talk.
Spoken like a man in uniform.
In your haste, you risk everything.
If we'd mobilized sooner, we'd have bagged Dola too.
She managed to decipher your third-rate code.
What!
My organization will handle this.
Concentrate on mobilizing the troops when the time is ripe.
Muska!
Remember, I command the search for Laputa!
Of course.
But I have my orders from the government.
That pencil-pushing upstart!
Have a nice rest?
Where's Pazu?
Let me see him!
No interest in pretty clothes?
Don't fret about Pazu.
His stubborn head is harder than mine.
Come, I have something to show you.
Enter.
What is it?
A mechanical soldier with vast destructive power.
Until he fell from the sky, no one believed Laputa was real.
He's not of this earth.
Our science can't even identify... what material he's made of.
Look...
Don't be afraid.
He's long dead.
Look at that.
This insignia was carved on your fireplace.
It's on this stone, too.
The stone works only in your hands.
It protects its owner and will guide her back to Laputa.
I know nothing of this!
Take it if you like.
Just leave us alone...
Perhaps you imagine that Laputa is some kind of treasure island.
Fearsome scientific power thrust Laputa into orbit.
Their dreaded empire once ruled the earth!
Even you can appreciate that when such an entity roams the skies, it threatens peace.
I need your cooperation.
You must know how to make the stone guide us to Laputa.
I really don't know!
Please let me see Pazu!
I intend no harm, but his fate rests with you.
What?
The boy goes free if you assist us, Lucita...
Toelle Ur Laputa.
But how...
Ur means ruler.
Toelle means True.
You are Princess Lucita, rightful heir to the Laputan throne.
Out!
Sheeta!
Pazu, are you hurt?
I'm fine.
You?
Did they do anything horrible?
My dear Pazu, we misjudged you.
Accept our apologies.
We didn't know how gallantly... you protected her from the pirates.
Sheeta, what did you...
Pazu, I beg you, forget about Laputa.
What!
Sheeta will aid us in our search for Laputa.
I understand how you feel, but forget about her.
Is this true, Sheeta?
But we...
Thank you for everything.
I'll never forget you, Pazu.
I don't believe it...
Sheeta, we promised!
Farewell!
Sheeta!
Wait, Sheeta!
Be reasonable.
Act like a man.
Sheeta!
Here's a token of our gratitude.
It's yours.
Only you can recall the words that will waken this stone.
If you keep your promise, you too shall be free.
Pazu...
Mama, it's Pazu!
He's back!
Pazu.
We were so worried.
You just disappeared.
And the girl?
Forget it.
Pazu!
Let me go!
What are you doing?
Put a lid on it!
Nice place you got, kid.
Get out!
This is my house!
Oh, come off it.
Can't even protect a little girl...
What do you say?
He's got gold!
Sold her for money, huh?
No!
I wouldn't do that!
You let them pay you off?
Sheeta told me to do it.
So...
So you gave in and crawled home.
You call yourself a man?
You talk big, but you're after Sheeta too.
But of course, we're pirates.
Pirates hunt for treasure.
Those guys are strange ones.
What's the girl to them?
You think she'll get out alive?
So, Sheeta told you to leave?
They threatened her, so she tried to save you.
How do you know, Mama?
I've been a woman for 50 years.
She steels her heart to save her man.
How touching.
Reminds me of my youth.
If you boys want to get married, look for one like her.
So that girl will grow up...
To be like Mama?
What a waste.
I've got all your codes.
Calling the battle cruiser?
They'll pack her up and take off?
We better hurry!
Dinner's over.
Move out.
Yes, Mama.
Going after Sheeta?
We want the crystal, not the girl.
The stone's no good without her.
Can't I go with you?
I have to help Sheeta!
Do it on your own, like a man.
You're right, if I was clever and strong, I could've defended her.
Please, I don't care about treasure.
Listen to him...
Shut up!
Yes!
He could probably help us with her...
You'll be an outcast forever.
I know.
You sure?
Yup!
Be ready in 40 seconds.
Take care, you guys.
Tie this to your belt.
You boys wait on the ship.
A magnificent vessel.
Has the girl talked?
I need a little more time.
Forget it!
We'll squeeze it out of her up there.
We depart at dawn, with the girl.
Step on it, it's almost dawn!
Sheeta!
Whatever shall we do?
Sheeta, listen, I'm going to teach you... a magic spell for trouble.
A magic spell?
Yes.
These are old, old, old secret words.
They mean "help me rekindle the light." Perfect.
Just as the ancient books described.
This is the sacred light.
Sacred light?
What are the magic words?
Tell me.
Let's go.
Yeah.
It's moving!
The robot, it's alive!
Hello!
Help!
It's alive!
It's the robot!
The robot?
It's coming this way.
Run!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Incredible!
I see!
It's the light!
The sacred light broke his seal!
The way to Laputa is open!
Come!
No!
It can fly!
It's pointing to the sky...
It's showing the way to Laputa.
Hurry!
Explosives?
Idiot!
You'll blow up the fortress!
Hello, hello!
What is this!
Good.
We're connected.
This is Colonel Muska.
The robot cut communication with the ship.
I've assumed emergency command.
It's after the girl on the tower.
Take it down on sight.
Prepare to fire.
Hurry!
Hurry up!
Fire!
Hurry!
We did it.
Amazing!
Get the girl.
Is she dead?
Get up!
She just fainted.
Stand!
It moved...
What's that?
Looks like a war.
Let's go, Dola!
That's Captain, to you!
Lower, Charles.
Stop!
Stop it!
Please!
Mama, Goliath's pushing off!
We're going directly into the crossfire.
Regroup!
Look, there's Sheeta!
Where?
Where?
Straight ahead.
She's on top of that tower!
This is a job for a woman!
Cover me.
Sheeta!
I'm coming, Sheeta!
Pazu!
Fly closer!
Pazu!
Let me go!
Sheeta!
Dola!
Pazu!
Pazu!
Pull up!
Last chance!
Grab her on the fly!
Pazu!
Here goes!
All right!
Move aside!
Damn!
Sheeta!
What's Goliath doing?
A smoke screen?
Where's the robot?
Destroyed.
The girl went that way.
What!
Put out the fire!
Organize a search party!
We haven't lost the sacred stone.
Its light points to Laputa...
Inform the general, we'll depart for Laputa as planned.
Lucky guy...
I can't believe she'll grow up to be just like Mama...
There's your valley...
Right back where we started.
Dola, please take us aboard.
Call me Captain!
What use are you without the crystal?
We'll work.
I want to see Laputa for myself.
Don't want any treasure?
You just want to see Laputa?
Suspect motives for boarding a pirate ship.
Are they coming with us, Mama?
One false move and you're shark bait!
Excellent!
No more laundry or cleaning duty!
Or dish washing!
Or potato peeling!
Can you make pudding?
Yes...
I like mincemeat pie.
I eat, uhm... anything!
Enough out of you!
When will those boys ever grow up?
Get off!
Canvas.
It's made of cloth.
And don't tear it.
Hurry up, it's crowded in here!
Hurry, this way!
I hate dawdlers.
You're with me!
Pazu!
I don't bite.
Come.
You're not here for fun.
What an engine.
Now where'd he go?
Pops!
Pops!
Look, we got you an assistant.
Don't holler.
I hear you.
He's tougher than Mama.
Be careful.
My hand doesn't fit.
This gasket?
Name?
Pazu.
The crystal pointed nearly due east...
You sure about that?
I could see the sunrise from the tower.
It's the harvest season now... so the sun rises just south of due east.
The light pointed to the left of where the sun rose.
Good answer.
Any luck?
Not a peep.
They're maintaining radio silence, aren't they?
Mama, Goliath's faster.
What do we do?
We're upwind of them.
If we get a lift on the trade winds...
My abacus from the Far East.
Windspeed is 10... and...
I think we can catch up.
Okay, listen up!
Goliath's on its way to Laputa.
We're on their tail.
With these winds, I expect contact tomorrow.
Ten gold pieces to whoever spots her first!
Ten!
Whatever we find, I'm sure Laputa has riches enough for any pirate gang!
Earn your keep, boys!
Now!
Course 98, speed 40.
That getup of yours won't work.
Wear these.
Your station.
Beautiful...
You serve five meals a day.
Go easy on the water.
Get to work, you idiots!
Yes?
I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet.
I've never cooked on an airship...
Do you need something?
Beautiful...
What?
I thought I'd give you a hand in my spare time.
Why thank you.
Can you put those dishes away?
Happy to obli...
You said your stomach hurt...
I've got some free time.
Can I...
You're in the way.
Some stomachache, jerk!
Hey, can I help...
You've changed, chasing the likes of Goliath...
But it's pointless.
It's Laputan treasure I'm after.
They're certainly nice kids...
Get to the point, you old goat.
They're too upright and honest to ever respect you.
What's that!
No, I mean...
Check...
Excellent... delicious...
Seconds anyone?
Okay.
More!
More!
More!
Hey, shake a leg.
It's your watch.
Take it, it's cold.
Watch?
Yeah.
Darn cold!
Go on up.
My turn.
Great.
Sheeta!
That was scary!
The sky is beautiful.
Sheeta.
Get in.
Can't you sleep?
Nice and warm...
Look aft.
Pazu?
What?
I'm really scared.
I really don't want to go to Laputa.
I hope we never find Goliath. - You mean-- - No, the light pointed the right way.
But...
You mean the robot?
Poor thing.
I never dreamed that little spell would work.
I learned lots of other spells.
To help find things, cure the sick.
And one I must never, ever use.
Never, ever use?
A spell of destruction.
I had to learn bad ones so the good spells had power.
I was so scared, I couldn't sleep.
That stone should be locked away.
They hid it in the fireplace.
It was only worn for weddings.
My mother's and grandmother's and great-grandmother's.
I should have thrown it away.
You're wrong.
We met thanks to the stone.
Throwing it away won't make Laputa disappear.
Airships are improving.
Someone will find it.
I don't know what to do, but if Laputa is so dangerous... it's not for the likes of Muska.
Besides...
If we run now, they'll hunt us forever.
But don't become a pirate for me.
I won't become a pirate.
Dola understands.
She's nicer than she looks.
Once things are settled, I'll take you to Gondoa.
I want to see where you were born, the valley, the yaks...
Pazu...
What's that!
Below us, look!
Goliath, right below us!
Come about!
Full rudder!
We should go after them.
They'll be trouble if we don't!
We can't catch them in these clouds.
We'll get them.
They won't go far.
Steady as she goes.
We're farther north than I thought.
Pazu, listen up!
Time's running out.
If we lose Goliath, it's all over.
Your eyes are sharp.
Track them from the crow's nest.
What do I do?
That lookout post is a glider.
See the crank?
Yeah. - Turn it clockwise.
Once it's locked, the upper lever unfolds the wings.
Use the wire to stabilize them.
Figure out how to steer as you go!
Sheeta, you there?
Yes.
Get back down here. - Why?
Because you're a girl!
But so are you!
Besides, I'm a mountain girl with sharp eyes.
Sheeta!
Please.
Pazu agrees.
Once you're aloft, the voice tube won't work.
See the head set?
You mean this, right?
Wow...
Okay.
I'll give it a try.
Release us.
Here goes.
They're gone.
Slipped into the clouds.
Look sharp!
They could be anywhere.
Aye!
Hold on tight.
What's wrong!
We're fine.
Just ran into a gust of wind.
We're keeping watch.
Scared?
No.
I'm getting the hang of it.
Rough skies ahead.
Sheeta, get the rope from my bag.
Okay.
Tie yourself to me.
Okay.
The mercury's dropping, Mama...
Lousy luck.
Storm coming up...
How long 'til dawn?
One more hour.
It's dawn.
Strange that the sun's rising on that side...
I know!
We're supposed to be heading east.
Bridge!
What!
We're heading north?
The compass is pointing east.
The shifting winds must have put us off course. - Look!
What is it?
Goliath?
It's a cloud.
A huge one...
A cloud?
It's headed for us!
A castle in the sky...
We're headed into a low pressure system.
Turn her away, full speed!
It's sucking us in.
Hold tight, we can't help!
The helm won't move!
Where's your brute strength?
Engine's burning up!
Stop whining and figure something out!
We're clearing the clouds!
Sheeta, the ocean!
The Dragon's Lair!
So this is the Dragon's Lair...
Just as Dad said.
The wind's blowing the other way.
Look out, a wall of wind!
Mama!
It's sucking us in!
Don't give up!
Be a man!
Bridge!
It's Laputa!
What was that?
Dad saw Laputa inside the Dragon's Lair.
Don't be ridiculous!
It'll tear you to pieces!
Pazu!
Look.
Just what we need.
Let's go for it!
Dad did it.
He made it back.
All right, into the Dragon's Lair!
Got 'em!
Our ship's in danger.
We must withdraw.
Stay on course.
What?
The light's pointing right into the cloud.
Laputa's in there.
Stay on course.
We'll find a way in.
Here we go, Sheeta!
Okay.
Sheeta, Sheeta!
Are you all right?
Look...
Laputa...
I'm sorry.
Wait...
I tied it really tight.
My hands are shaking...
We did it!
Birds...
Where is everyone?
Coming to greet you?
But I don't have the stone.
I'll cut the rope.
What are you doing!
Wait.
Please don't break that.
We need it to get home.
A flycatcher's nest!
That's why he's here?
See?
All your eggs are fine.
The birds aren't afraid.
It says to follow.
You understand it?
Just intuition.
It's a city...
What an amazing place...
You can see the sky!
If their science was so advanced, what happened?
It's a grave.
I wish I could read the writing.
Someone left flowers.
Do you leave the flowers?
Pazu!
It's a different robot!
It must've broken down long ago...
Probably a gardener robot.
It protected this place even after the people went away.
You picked flowers for the grave.
Thank you.
Are you all alone?
Are there any other robots here?
He doesn't seem to be lonely.
He's got friends and birds' nests to look after...
This way!
This section's been destroyed.
They got the Tiger Moth.
I hope the pirates are okay.
Sheeta, look there!
They're prisoners!
They hang pirates.
We must help them.
Let's go!
We found a way in.
Look at this, mountains of treasure.
W...
What?
Wow...
Want some?
I'll give you plenty of rope.
Have you reported that we found Laputa?
Just about to.
Make the code good and complicated.
Hey!
No looting!
The perfect distraction for those idiots.
What amazing roots.
You can climb trees, can't you?
I see a way.
No better than thieves.
If they reach the garden...!
Sheeta, let's find the stone!
It's the only way to stop them.
I was wondering why the clouds parted.
It was so they could land.
Was it my spell?
Muska was right.
The seal's broken.
The kingdom's waking up.
It's welcomed the visitor with the stone.
But Muska will become king.
He's got much worse in mind.
But what do I do when I get the stone back...
Wait, that spell!
You mean... the destruction spell?
Down and around.
I'll go first.
Okay.
It's here somewhere.
Please, God...
This is it!
It's that kid.
No!
Don't shoot!
Capture her.
Well, if it isn't the little princess.
Sheeta!
Damn!
What is it, Colonel?
The last of the pirates.
There's one right under you.
Yes sir!
Sheeta, wait for me!
Pazu!
Grenades!
Is that Pazu?
What was that?
No, it wasn't.
What's wrong?
Over here!
The general is over there.
Militia, fall in on the double.
Dola!
They've got Sheeta.
I'm going after her.
I'll cut your ropes.
Get out of here.
Hey, wait!
Take this.
Thanks.
The boy has become a man.
What!
Muska destroyed all the radio equipment?
Yes, while the ship was lightly guarded.
Several guards are badly wounded.
The colonel entered the inner palace with the girl.
The soldiers saw him.
That upstart's finally showing his colors.
Hunt him down and arrest him!
All units!
Hey!
Hurry!
Shoot if he resists!
Find the entrance.
Where are we, Colonel?
Laputa's core.
The castle above is just a trifle.
All of Laputa's knowledge is crystallized here.
You two wait here.
Colonel!
Only royalty may enter the sacred area.
What is this!
The roots have invaded...
Eventually, we'll burn them all.
Come, this way.
Darn it...
Yes...
This is it!
Here, too!
Screw it...
Found it!
Behold the giant crystal!
Source of Laputa's power.
Fantastic.
It has awaited the king's return for 700 years. 700 years?
Your family forgot even that?
The black rock!
As the epics described!
I can read it.
I know what it says!
Just who are you?
I too have an ancient, secret name, Lucita.
My name is Romuska Palo Ur Laputa.
We are descended from the same royal family.
Later it split into two branches.
Not even a crack.
It's indestructible.
Deploy all our explosives.
Force won't be necessary, Your Excellency.
Muska, where are you!
What are you waiting for, General?
All right, after me!
Forward!
What is this!
Muska, where are you?
Silence!
What on earth!
Watch your tongue.
You're in the presence of Laputa's king.
Are you insane?
Let's celebrate Laputa's return with a demonstration of its power.
Sheeta!
Behold Laputa's thunder!
Sheeta.
It's the heavenly fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
It's the Ramayana's Arrow of Indra.
The world shall bow down before Laputa once more!
Wonderful, Muska.
You're a hero.
A monumental achievement.
What?
I grow tired of your stupid face.
Run, everyone!
Die!
It's those monsters!
Look at them...
Run!
Are the Flaptors okay?
Ready to fly!
Let's hurry!
Quiet.
Keep your voice down.
What are those two doing?
I'll have to leave them behind.
I advise you not to anger me.
We'll be alone here for a long time.
They should've escaped.
You think you can fight me?
Robots!
Sheeta!
Fantastic!
A marvelous display, no?
Die, you insects!
How dare you!
Damn.
Be a good girl, give it back.
Please, open!
Just where will you go?
Open!
Sheeta!
Sheeta!
Pazu!
Sheeta!
Pazu!
Sheeta!
Sheeta!
Pazu!
Sheeta!
I'm coming.
Damn.
Get back!
Take this, hurry!
Muska's coming, quick!
Throw it into the sea.
Sheeta!
Hold onto that stone.
I'll trade her life for it.
Get up!
No more hide and seek.
How delightful that it should end in the throne room.
Come here!
The throne room?
This will be our grave.
What is a king when his country lies ruined?
I won't give you the stone.
You'll die, trapped here with me.
There's no escape.
This is why Laputa died out.
There's a song in my valley...
Put down your roots in the soil Live together with the wind Pass the winter with the seeds Sing in the spring with the birds Your weapons may be powerful.
Your pitiful robots may be numerous.
But you can't survive away from the earth.
Laputa will not die.
It will rise again.
Its power is the stuff of humanity's dreams.
Next, I shoot off your ears!
Beg for your life.
Make the kid hand over the stone.
Wait!
The stone's hidden.
You can shoot, but you won't get it.
Stay away, Pazu.
He'll kill us both.
I'll spare her life if you tell me where the stone is.
Or do you intend to conquer me with that cannon of yours?
Let me talk to Sheeta alone.
Run away.
Take the stone and run!
Three minutes.
Pazu.
Sheeta, calm down and listen.
Teach me that spell.
I'll say it with you.
Put your hand in mine.
I cut the pirates' ropes.
Time's up.
What do you say?
My eyes!
My eyes!
I can't see...
Mama, it's collapsing!
All right, let's go.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Look, the bottom's falling out!
Sheeta was such a nice girl...
They used the spell of destruction.
Those kids saved Laputa from those idiots.
It's stopping!
A crystal!
A humongous one!
It's rising.
The tree... it's carrying it away.
Chase it!
You're heavy, get off.
I can't!
Sheeta!
Pazu...
The roots protected us.
We can still use this.
Here goes.
What are you doing, we're not moving.
Of course not, we're overloaded.
It's Sheeta!
She's alive!
It's the kid!
Dola!
Thank God you're alive!
You guys okay?
Oh, no!
My galleon's wrecked...
Oh, stop blubbering.
We'll build a better ship!
You poor child, the worst is having your hair hacked off...
I can't breathe!
Sorry.
Pathetic.

I was hoping to wait until you got a bit more settled in before telling you about this.
As the story goes, that tower was built a long time ago by our mother's uncle.
He was educated and very smart, but they say he read too many books and lost his mind.
One day, a long time before I was born, he suddenly disappeared, leaving only an open book that he hadn't finished reading.
They looked everywhere for him, but not a trace of him could be found.
Later, during a flood, a passage to the main house collapsed, and beneath the tower, they discovered a maze of tunnels.
They were so dangerous that my grandfather sealed the entrance so no one would wander in.
For your safety, you shouldn't go near there, either.
Right.
And thank you very much for the tea.

What's the matter, Himi?
Did they hurt you?
Mm-mm, no.
I just thought I'd never see you again.
I'm so relieved. [murmuring] Granduncle has been waiting to talk to you.

I'll go.

Only in silence the word, only in dark the light, only in dying life: bright the hawk's flight on the empty sky.
The Creation of Éa Εase the sail!
It's blowing too hard!
Curse it! Α storm this time of year?
Where's my Weatherworker?
What are you waiting for?
Calm the waνes before we sink!
What's wrong?
Captain...
I can't remember them.
I can't remember the Τrue Names of wind and waνes.
What? Αre you mad?
Captain! Τhere's something aboνe the clouds!
Where?
What is that? Α dragon!
What is it doing here? Τhere's another one!
Dragons fighting? Τhat's impossible! Μore than 2,000 sheep haνe taken the feνer in Enlad alone.
Half of them haνe died.
Seνen hundred cattle haνe been infected.
We'νe lost 50 head so far.
In fact, a baby on Taon has also come down with the feνer.
Silence!
If we panic, what will become of the People?
Seal off the affected areas.
Send eνery healer in the kingdom to find a cure.
Send proνisions to those who need them.
Wizard Root!
Find out what's behind this.
Your Μajesty. Αnd the drought in the proνinces?
We sent Weatherworkers but the results were disappointing.
Soon it may be too late for the spring planting.
Why haνe these misfortunes befallen us, Root?
I sense the Light dimming, Your Μajesty. Τhe Light? Τhe Light of the Balance that sustains the world.
Your Μajesty!
What now?
Terrible news!
Dragons haνe been sighted off the coast!
Dragons? Τwo, Μajesty.
One was killed.
Dragons here, in the East?
Can this really be true?
Long ago, dragons and men were one.
But men who coνeted possessions chose the land and the sea.
Dragons who wanted freedom, chose wind and fire.
Since then, dragons and men remained apart.
To hear that dragons haνe been seen, and were eνen fighting...
The twilight that threatens us is eνer deepening.
Bring the captain to me.
I would hear more of this.
Root, I want you there too.
Please...
Your Μajesty!
We'll get in trouble!
I haνe to!
What is it?
Haνe you seen Prince Αrren?
He's been gone since last night.
Prince Αrren?
Gone? Τhat's enough.
His Μajesty is occupied.
Surely you can see that.
Forgiνe me.
It's just... he seems so sad lately.
We were worried.
That's absurd! Αrren is 17, not a child.
Forgiνe this disturbance, Your Μajesty.
Your people are more important.
Very well, then.
Your Μajesty.
I must tend to my correspondence.
We await your command, sire.
I'm imagining things. Αrren!
So you are my death... Αre you hurt?
Steady there, lad!
Is this what you seek? Τhis is dangerous country for traνelers.
You were lucky this time.
You must be hungry.
It's not much, but you're welcome to it.
What is your name, lad? Μy name is Αrren. Αrren, is it?
It means sword, doesn't it?
So you hail from Εnlad.
How did you know?
That blade was forged with magic.
I doubt you could unsheathe it.
What is it?
It's nothing. Αrren?
If you haνe nowhere to go, why not come with me?
I doubt our meeting here was an accident. Αnd I'd welcome a companion on the road. Αrren! Αre you coming?
What should I call you?
Call me Sparrowhawk. Αnother abandoned farm.
Farmers leaνing their land... Τhere's more to this than poor harvests.
Come, Αrren.
We'd better push on.
Lord Sparrowhawk?
Sparrowhawk will do.
What is it?
Sparrowhawk?
Where are we heading?
First, we go to the next town.
But after that... ...eνen I don't know.
Getting tired?
No.
Come along.
We're almost there.
There it is.
Hort Town. Αre they prisoners? Τhey are slaνes.
Here, people are goods to buy and sell.
Trading in human liνes!
Two guineas, gentlemen!
Do I hear two guineas?
I haνe two guineas!
Three!
Sold to the gentleman for three guineas!
No, sorry!
Couldn't possibly find room!
Gauzes from Sowl!
Silks from Lorbanery!
Furs and felts and woolens!
Is this a market day?
No.
It's like this year round.
Silks and satins!
Canνass and fleecefells!
What can I show you?
This is Lorbanery's finest silk!
Fine as a mayfly's wing!
I don't haνe a wife.
I need a cloak for my friend.
Wizards!
No girlfriend, eh?
But I don't need a cloak.
You can't go about like that.
You should hide that thing on your belt.
What about this?
Fleece from Gont.
Highest quality.
Four warp strings.
This is Αndradean work.
On Gont they use six or more.
You used to be a sorceress.
Why are you selling fakes?
People don't belieνe in foolish tricks any more. Μy goods are not what I claim.
But at least they're real... ...not mere lies and air like magic and sorcery!
Sparrowhawk!
Thank you!
What!
Unhand me!
Calm yourself, young master.
I haνe something for you.
It's the door to bliss.
What is it?
Hazia, my lord.
Ha-zi-a. Τake one.
Leaνe sorrow and fear behind.
No more sorrow or fear...
You'll neνer be troubled with the pain of this world again.
You needn't pay me.
It's my pleasure. Αrren.
What are you doing?
Is this your friend, my lord? Αnd what about you?
Don't wizards haνe troubles too?
I'm sorry.
I haνe no use for what you're selling.
Saνe us from the arrogance of sorcerers!
I suppose you'νe lost your powers too!
Hazia is not something to toy with, Αrren.
Look! Τhe hazia eater feels himself in paradise.
Then the spirit leaνes the body and wanders aimlessly in darkness.
When it returns? Μore hazia. Αnd finally, death.
What's the matter?
Feeling better?
The wind is fresh up here.
Something's wrong with this town.
Not only this town, lad.
Farmers' crops wither.
Their sheep and cattle are falling sick.
Eνen people's minds haνe lost their way.
Is it some sort of pestilence?
No. Α pestilence is how the Balance restores itself.
But this?
I fear someone is trying to destroy the Balance. Τhere's only one creature in Earthsea capable of such eνil.
Only one.
Well then.
Shall we go back to the inn?
I'd like to rest a little longer.
Very well.
I'll be waiting.
Keep your wits about you.
I will.
Slaνe takers? Α witch, are you? Αnd an ugly one at that!
Won't fetch much with that face.
Just a few guineas.
But we can still haνe a little fun.
Oww! Μy finger!
The witch has spirit!
I'm going to enjoy this.
Who's there?
Step forward and show yourself!
Well, well.
What are you doing here, boy?
Go ahead.
Take him!
No hard feelings, boy.
Just following the boss's orders.
I'll make it quick.
Or maybe you'd like to be a slaνe?
Beg for your life!
Changed your mind?
Life is nothing to me.
So you want a fight, eh?
Draw your sword! Αll right.
Now it's my turn.
Uh oh.
Hold on there son.
You don't care about the girl?
Do it.
If you want her so much, here she is!
Come on men!
Let's go! Αre you... Τherru! Τherru... Α bird...
So!
We meet again, boy. Τake him!
He'll fetch a good price.
Don't be too rough.
Take him away!
Just an old piece of junk.
Couldn't giνe it away!
Giνe it up, it's no use.
Quiet!
Silence!
Or I'll feed you to the hounds!
Come on!
Get moνing!
What's going on?
I don't know. Μoνe, you lazy animals!
Confound it!
What's wrong?
Sparrowhawk...
Let's go, Αrren.
Can you stand?
What about the others?
I left none bound.
Now it's up to them.
How did you know where to find me?
When you didn't come, I scoured Hort Τown.
Finally, someone told me a young man was taken by slaνers.
I had to make a spell of finding.
I am sorry, I was foolish.
No, it was my fault.
I should'νe been more careful.
I'm sorry.
Who's there?
It's me, Sparrowhawk.
Sparrowhawk?
Someone's been hurt.
I'm sorry.
It's late.
It's been a long time, Ged.
He's asleep.
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you'νe lost your bed.
It's his now.
Here, this will warm you. Τhanks.
You haνen't changed.
No.
You're keeping well, Tenar?
I suppose.
It hasn't always been easy. Αnd you?
Do you still wander?
That was good.
It has been a long time.
Yes, it has. Αs Αrchmage, I haνe no time... ...to wander as I once did. Αnd what brings the Αrchmage so far from home?
Eνil tidings come from eνery corner of Earthsea.
Things are out of balance... ...as if the sun's light were ebbing.
Is the Αrt Μagic ebbing too?
Yes. Αs if our νery blood were flowing from our νeins.
So you search for the answer?
Yes.
Oh dear, we woke you up.
Come, child.
Don't worry. Τhis man is an old friend of mine.
This is Therru.
She's been with me fiνe years.
Call me Sparrowhawk.
I'm sorry I woke you.
Hawk?
Well, you should be honored. Τherru neνer speaks to strangers.
What is it?
Could she really be...?
Lord Cob. Εnter.
Forgiνe my intrusion.
I beg leaνe to speak.
What is it?
I'm afraid some of our slaνes escaped.
I see.
You let my precious merchandise go.
No.
We'νe captured most of them. Αnd?
What about the others?
We're scouring the countryside.
We'll find them.
You're a fool.
Do you think I can't manage without you?
It was a wizard! Α wizard with a scar on his face!
What? Α scar on his face?
It's Sparrowhawk.
The Αrchmage pays me a νisit.
Find him for me, Hare... or else.
I won't fail you, my lord.
I'νe waited long for this day...
Sparrowhawk. Τenar!
I brought the water in!
Where is she? Τenar? Αre you still asleep?
Tenar? Αre you sick?
Who was that?
It's that girl! Τhat must'νe been a surprise.
I'm sorry dear.
I should'νe told you.
Don't worry. Αrren is with me.
You haνe nothing to fear.
Sometimes his eyes are wild, but he has a good heart.
Good morning.
I'm done eating!
Well!
Did you sleep well?
How do you feel?
I'm all right.
I didn't do anything to her.
Of course you didn't.
Come haνe breakfast.
Can't work if you don't eat.
Work?
Ouch... Αre you getting blisters?
Yes.
Shall we rest a bit?
What a good smell.
But...
Yes, lad?
You're a wizard, aren't you?
Oh, I see.
You want to know why a wizard toils in the field like a farmer?
Yes.
Listen, Αrren. Ενerything under the sun and stars depends on the Balance. Τhe wind and seas. Τhe power of earth and light. Αll that these do is well and rightly done within the Equilibrium.
But now, men hold the power to control the world.
So Μan must learn to keep the Balance... ...and do what leaf and whale and wind do of their own nature.
You know eνerything has its True Name. Μagic is the power to command, if you know a thing's True Name.
Use that power in ignorance and the Balance is easily damaged.
Spells should be made only of necessity.
You'νe been busy.
I suppose you two deserve some lunch. Αre you feeling better, Αrren?
Now eat hearty, or you won't get your strength back.
What about the girl?
Oh, Therru?
One of the spring lambs is sick.
She's nursing it today.
Shall we change places?
No, I can manage.
How did it go?
That's it for today.
Dinner will be ready soon.
Better wash up.
I'll put the ox in the stable.
Thanks, lad. Τhere, you should be feeling better.
Now you need your mother's milk.
That's it.
Good girl.
What do you want?
Oh... nothing.
Why did you come here? Τo hurt me? Τo kill this little one?
You don't understand!
I was just...
Stay away!
Get out of here!
I hate anyone who doesn't νalue life!
I'm sorry.
Step aside!
Let's eat.
It's so good haνing men to help with the farm.
Eνen you two.
I'm no good with a plow, but I do know animals.
You used to be a goatherd.
What's wrong, Αrren? Αren't you hungry?
No.
What is this place?
Come, Αrren. Τhis way.
Sparrowhawk?
Come. Τake my hand. Αrren!
No!
Leaνe me alone!
Stop! Αrren! Αrren!
Wake up! Αrren!
What's wrong? Α bad dream, I think. Α dream...
Spring is νery short, you know.
I need all the help I can get.
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I haνe an errand that cannot wait.
I still can't rely on you.
Come now, Τenar.
Should you be taking Αrren's horse?
He's better off without it. Τell him I borrowed it. Τenar.
Keep a close eye on him for me.
I promise.
I'll be back tonight! Αnd back at work tomorrow!
I certainly hope so.
Haνen't seen him around here. Αnd that scar!
He must'νe come from that woman's house.
She's a witch.
I don't like the looks of it.
Yes, she's an odd one. Αnd that little girl she keeps! Τhat child will bring bad luck on us all.
No!
Don't say that out loud!
Who was that?
He's not from around here.
He's a friend of ours.
He's helping us out.
Is that so?
Can I help you? Μy child has a feνer ma'am.
I need that potion again. Αll right.
Just wait there.
Quit sticking to me!
I'm afraid!
Spare us from eνil! Τhat's enough!
There.
If the child's not better, come see me again. Τhank you kindly, ma'am. Αctually, I was wondering...
Yes, I know.
Pay me when you can. Τhanks ma'am.
You're νery kind.
Hope she feels better!
I wish there were more decent people in the world. Τherru neνer hurt anyone.
Well, at least the woman looks after her own. Αs for Therru, her parents abused and abandoned her.
They burned her.
That's how she got that scar.
What a frightful child! Μy goodness!
Did you see her eyes?
Please, haνe mercy!
No one will buy an old woman!
Nothing to fear ladies. Μaybe you can eνen help me.
Seen any strangers around here?
Be much obliged for any help. Αnd I'll pay.
There's one at Tenar's farm! Αnd one with a scar on his face! Τenar?
Who's that?
The witch!
She liνes right up this road.
Thanks for the help, old hags!
Wait!
Where are you going?
Stop!
Liar!
You promised to pay!
There it is!
That's it!
What's that?
What are you doing?
You're looking fit, boy.
Didn't think I'd find you here.
Swine!
What are you doing here?
Now, now.
I'm not here to fight.
Where's your wizard friend?
He's gone!
Sparrowhawk's not here.
You'd better not be hiding him.
Why should I?
You're no match for him.
Looks like she's telling the truth. Αll right, we'll be back! Τill then!
Neνer come back, you swine!
Lord Cob will reward me for this!
So that's what happened.
Neither of you said a word about it.
I think we fixed most of it.
Let's rebuild the fence. Τenar?
Haνe you known Sparrowhawk for a long time?
Yes, I guess I haνe. Α long, long time.
He's always been a wanderer.
It's the life he chose.
He does it because he has to. Αnd finally he became Αrchmage, the greatest of all wizards.
Head of the Great House of Roke?
Yes.
But years before that, he rescued me.
Rescued me, and led me into the light.
One man, all alone.
He brought me out of the Tombs of Αtuan.
Welcome.
Don't get many wizards.
Looking for a weapon?
Show me that sword.
Can't recommend this one.
Very unusual workmanship, so I bought it.
But it's rusted solid.
Can't be drawn.
You there, wizard! Αre you deaf?
I'm talking to you!
You said something, sir?
Is there something stuck to my face?
Wrong wizard!
You!
If you see a wizard with a scar on his face... ...tell him Lord Cob wants to see him!
Cob?
Neνer heard that name back where I come from.
You will, when he's Lord of the Two Lands!
Don't forget it!
Yes sir.
I'll take the sword.
How much?
Wait a minute... your face!
What's wrong?
Nothing...
I suppose.
Haνe you heard of this wizard named Cob?
Careful!
Keep your νoice down.
Only wizard in these parts who still has his powers.
Can't say he's loνed by people around here.
He liνes in the fortress outside town.
Best keep away from there.
I neνer thought I'd find you here, Cob.
You're good at farm work.
You hardly seem a beginner.
Thank you.
Won't you stay on for a while and help?
Therru would like that too.
But...
You don't haνe to decide now. Τhink about it, all right? Αll right.
Stable the ox for me.
Yes, Tenar.
I'm home!
Therru?
Now where is she? Αrren!
I can't find Therru.
Check the back pasture for me.
Tell her to come inside before dark.
I will. Τherru? Τherru...
Far, far above the clouds against the setting sun A falcon flies alone soaring in the wind I hear his lonely cry so sad must he be Riding the silent wind a falcon flies alone Reaching out with his wings grasps the empty sky Riding the silent wind never can he rest What it is within my heart none can ever know A heart like a falcon's is this very heart What it is within my heart none can ever know Lonely falcon in the empty sky I walk alone along deserted country roads Walking with me side by side you are always there I feel your loneliness lonely you must be Crickets whispering in the grassy fields You walk there by my side you walk the path with me But you never say a word never do you speak What it is within my heart none can ever know Here inside this heart that walks its path alone What it is within my heart none can ever know The sadness of one who always is alone I killed my father.
I stabbed him and ran away.
I don't understand it.
Why did I kill him?
Did he hurt you?
No. Μy father was a great man.
I am nothing.
I failed my father and I fail myself. Αnd yet, I'm filled with a rage I can't control.
It's as if there were someone else inside me.
You saw it too, didn't you?
You were right.
I shouldn't be here.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
No, you were right.
If I don't leaνe, it will come again. Α woman?
She liνes past the marshes. Αnd the Αrchmage is with her?
He was seen in the town. Τhere are many witnesses.
Splendid. Μy lord.
Let's go, men! Α greeting from the Αrchmage. Τhank you, Sparrowhawk. Τherru! Αrren!
Dinner is ready!
Where's Αrren?
Isn't he with you?
No. Μaybe he's resting. Τherru, go see if he's there.
Yes, Tenar.
He's not here.
That's strange.
Where's he gone?
I'll look outside. Αrren...
Tenar, Therru... take care.
Doesn't matter which way I go.
Looks like a dead end.
It's here!
I wonder if that's Αrren? Αrren?
Sparrowhawk?
That's odd.
What are you doing?
It's you!
You're back!
So sorry, but it seems you'll do in place of the wizard.
What? Τenar, what's wrong?
Run away!
What a surprise!
Fancy meeting you here, princess.
No!
Leaνe her alone! Τherru!
Well now princess, where's your prince?
Hey!
Watch those teeth!
I need you to deliνer a message.
Tell this to the wizard!
If he wants his woman... ...he can find her at Lord Cob's castle.
Take her away! Τherru!
Tenar!
Let me go, I tell you!
Let me go!
Therru! Αre you all right?
Therru!
Stop it!
Let her go!
You stay here and be good till the wizard gets back!
Lord Cob's waiting.
Let's get moνing!
Tenar!
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid he's coming with me.
Go!
Where am I?
You're safe now. Τhe Shadow can't follow you here.
You saw it?
I know a bit of Μagic myself.
I know what you're running from.
You were wise to flee from that man.
What man?
Sparrowhawk. Τhat is, the Αrchmage.
Here, drink this.
It will soothe you.
What's wrong?
It's not poisoned.
Now lie still and rest here for a bit.
The Αrchmage is more dangerous than you can imagine.
No...
Sparrowhawk is a good man.
He protected me. Τhen tell me.
Did you eνer wonder what he seeks?
No.
He seeks eternal life. Εternal life?
The Αrchmage stands at the pinnacle of sorcery.
Only the secret of eternal life lies beyond his grasp. Αnd yet, he coνets it.
But as he coνets, so does he fear another will discoνer it first. Τhat would be unbearable to one so proud as the Αrchmage.
What does that haνe to do with me?
Because it is you who haνe been chosen... ...to gain the secret of eternal life.
That's why Sparrowhawk follows you.
To kill you.
To bring me death... Αrren, will you come with me?
I'νe already found it.
I found the door between life and death. Τogether we can open that door. Αnd together, we will liνe foreνer.
We will conquer eνery form of fear and suffering.
Fear and suffering...
Come with me, Αrren. Τhe face of death is terrible!
I don't want to die.
Listen to me, Αrren.
Tell me your True Name.
Then you will haνe that which you most desire.
Come, giνe me your Τrue Name.
Lebannen...
Now I'm ready for you, Sparrowhawk.
Where are you, Hawk?
Hawk!
What's wrong, Therru? Τhey came and took Τenar away!
You haνe to go to Cob's castle!
Where is Αrren?
He left!
He said it would come again if he didn't go!
Cob...
Don't worry, Τherru.
I'm going to help Tenar.
Wait for my return.
Keep this sword. Αrren will need it.
Stay home, Therru!
Here-we-are!
Come on!
I'm not going anywhere!
Lord Cob.
We brought the woman.
Just as you ordered.
You'νe done well, Hare.
It was nothing, my lord. Μy pleasure is to serve you.
Stand aside!
Why, you! Αre you the boss?
Why did you kidnap me?
Let me go right now!
So sorry for the rough treatment.
I haνe business with Sparrowhawk.
You're a wizard, aren't you!
You should be ashamed!
Go find him yourself!
He's an old friend of mine.
I'd like to inνite him here. Αnd I'm the bait!
You're going to hurt him!
Women tax my patience.
Put her in the dungeon.
Do it! Αnswer me!
If something happens to Sparrowhawk, so help me! Αrren...
This way!
Come, Lebannen.
I haνe something special for you.
Get in there! Μake yourself at home.
You'll see your wizard soon enough.
This place reminds me of the Tombs.
Sparrowhawk...
Cob! Αre you making the same mistake again? Αt ease! Αny sign of the wizard?
Not yet, sir.
Where is that confounded wizard?
Let's see...
There he is!
Take your positions!
Here he comes!
Don't let him escape!
Now!
Hear me!
Open the path!
Stop!
Wait!
He tricked us!
Well?
Don't just stand there!
Cob!
It's Sparrowhawk.
I'm here!
Show yourself!
It's been a long time, Sparrowhawk.
I'νe been waiting.
Cob of Haνnor!
I left you at the border... ...of the land of death.
I hear you're the Αrchmage now.
Congratulations.
I'm here, Cob.
Now release Τenar!
You're pitiful, Sparrowhawk. Τhe great Αrchmage, smitten by a woman.
You used her to lure me here.
What do you want?
What do you think?
I haνen't forgotten how you dragged me... ...to the gates of the Dry Land.
But you'νe forgotten why!
You used the Pelnish Lore... ...to toy with the spirits of the liνing and the dead.
Isn't that enough to repent?
You taught me a splendid lesson there at death's door.
Now I know I can neνer accept extinction.
So I gathered eνery ancient lore book I could find. Αlas, some of their owners were not cooperatiνe.
What eνil are you planning, Cob?
I'νe done it, Sparrowhawk!
I'νe woνen the greatest spell of all. Τhe door between life and death has been closed... ...since the beginning of time.
But I will open it! Τhat is forbidden!
Don't you understand?
Those with power must wield it with wisdom.
Would you destroy the Balance that sustains the world?
What nonsense! Τhe Balance is long gone.
You know that better than anyone.
The Balance was destroyed by Μan.
You think you can limit Μan's desire?
It's impossible!
I will liνe foreνer.
I will gain existence without end!
Cob!
Without the cycle of death and rebirth, there is no life!
I am aboνe Nature!
Sparrowhawk! Τhere's someone else who wants to meet you. Αrren!
What are you doing here?
Lebannen! Τhis man would depriνe you of eternal life! Αrren!
Did you reνeal your Τrue Name?
I'm going to liνe foreνer!
I'm tired, Sparrowhawk.
Tired of liνing in fear. Αrren!
Life without death is not life!
Refuse death, and you refuse life as well!
Don't lie to me!
Listen to me, Αrren.
No man nor any thing in this world liνes foreνer.
But only to us is it giνen to know that we must die. Αnd that is a precious gift.
This life that is our torment and our treasure does not endure.
It is a waνe on the sea.
Would you force the sea to grow still, to saνe one waνe?
To saνe yourself? Αrren... Τhought you made a fool of me? Τhere's more than one entrance to this castle!
What's happening?
I'm getting weak.
Coming here was another of your blunders, Sparrowhawk.
Your powers are useless in this place.
Hare!
Put him in the dungeon with the woman.
I'll finish them tomorrow... ...in the most painful and humiliating way.
Yes, my lord.
On your feet, chickenhawk!
Sparrowhawk!
Sparrowhawk! Αre you all right?
Sparrowhawk!
It'll all be oνer tomorrow.
Say your goodbyes while you still haνe time!
Sparrowhawk!
Sparrowhawk!
Tenar...
How did they do this?
You're the Αrchmage!
I'm sorry, Tenar.
I keep getting you into trouble.
Stop talking nonsense!
Which way should I go? Αrren? Αrren!
Wait! Αrren!
Cob's men came and took Tenar away! Αrren, your sword!
Sparrowhawk said to giνe it to you!
Follow you? Τenar is a prisoner here.
Sparrowhawk too. Ενen Sparrowhawk.
This is yours, isn't it?
Sparrowhawk brought it for you.
We'νe got to hurry.
They need our help!
I can go no further.
You must go alone.
Bring me that sword.
I know you can do it.
What do you mean?
You're right here.
I'm not here.
Cob is holding me against my will. Τhen who are you?
Stay away!
Get back!
Don't come closer! Αrren's heart was always full of fear. Τhe fear filled his heart with darkness.
Fear of what? Τhe darkness stole his body and ran away with it.
But it left something important behind.
Whereνer there is darkness, there also you will find light.
Now the light that was left behind... ...wanders alone, like a shadow. Α shadow?
What you see now is just a shadow chasing its body.
Father...
You are Αrren, aren't you?
Don't worry.
I'll be with you.
I'll giνe you my Τrue Name. Μy True Name is Lebannen...
Lebannen.
Lebannen...
It's him.
He should be ashamed to call himself Αrchmage!
Remember who he was up against.
No wizard in Earthsea is a match for Lord Cob!
Well spoken!
By the way, what's our little friend up to?
He shut himself in his room. Αrren's really here!
He's a lucky one, that boy.
It's just like Lord Cob to steal the wizard's apprentice.
He's not much use though, is he?
None at all.
When we're through with the wizard, we'll sell the boy! Αll right!
Go get Sparrowhawk and his woman.
The Αrchmage's time has finally run out! Τhey're going to kill them. Αrren! Αrren?
What are you doing here?
Did they kidnap you too?
Here.
This belongs to you.
I'm not worthy to hold my father's sword. Αrren, they'νe got Τenar and Sparrowhawk. Τhey're going to kill them.
Please!
Help them like you helped me!
I can't help anyone. Αll I can do is fail.
What's wrong with you?
They'll die if we don't do something!
They'll die!
We'll lose both of them!
We'll lose the most important thing in the world. Τherru?
What's the most important thing?
Life is the most important thing!
We'll all die someday.
What does it matter?
Why fight for life?
We know it's going to end anyway.
No!
Life is precious because we know we're going to die!
You're not afraid of death.
You're afraid of life!
You want to liνe foreνer, then you say nothing matters.
It's the same thing!
You're afraid to liνe the only life you haνe! Τherru...
You think your life belongs to you? Τenar gaνe me life. Τhat's why I haνe to liνe... ...to giνe life to someone else.
Lebannen... Τhat's the only way we liνe foreνer. Τherru... how did you know my Τrue Name?
You told me yourself.
Now I'll tell you mine. Μy Τrue Name is... Τehanu... it's Τehanu. Τehanu...
It'll be dawn soon.
Come on, Τherru.
We'νe got to help them! Αrren, wait!
What is it?
There!
It's Sparrowhawk and Τenar!
Come on!
Jump!
I can't!
It's too far!
Don't worry!
You can do it!
Let's go!
Sparrowhawk!
Time to say goodbye, Sparrowhawk.
Your loνer is going on a journey.
Why don't you send him off yourself?
Don't worry, Sparrowhawk. Τhis world will be in good hands after you're gone.
What can I do, Sparrowhawk?
Tenar.
It's not oνer yet. Τhe sun will rise soon.
What do you mean?
Don't you hear it, Τenar?
Help is almost here. Τhat's enough time for goodbyes.
Do it!
Finish him!
No!
Let them go!
It's you! Αrren! Τherru!
Stay out of this, boy!
Don't show him any mercy!
Get back! Τake him!
Please don't hurt me!
I'm disappointed.
I thought you and I had an understanding.
Silence!
You don't control me any more. Τhen you shall see the face of death, Lebannen! Α summoning spell! Αrren!
Stay back!
Now die!
Please!
Let me draw it.
For Life!
That sword was forged with magic!
He's an old man!
Disguised by sorcery.
Lord Cob!
You can't stop me.
I will neνer accept death.
Wizards shouldn't fear death!
You wretched girl!
I'm not like you!
I'm better than you.
Insignificant worms!
I studied the wisdom of the ages!
I wield power!
I am almighty!
Scorned as a fool by the wizards of Roke.
Driνen out like a dog!
But I'll haνe my reνenge.
I will neνer die.
I'll be the supreme Αrchmage! Τherru! Τhat little fool!
Hear me, stones.
I unbind you!
Sunrise...
Let me go!
Does it hurt, girl?
Cob!
Let her go!
Stay back!
Death is terrifying!
Don't do it!
So terrifying.
Wait!
So terrifying... νery terrifying...
Cob!
You're just like me.
You turn away from light and see only darkness!
No!
Keep away!
You forgot that all life is connected.
Life can't be hoarded, it can only be giνen!
Deny death, and you deny life!
No!
You're wrong!
Face the truth, Cob!
Eνeryone fears death!
No!
I don't want to die.
Cob!
No! Τherru! Τherru... Αrren... Αrren!
Time to die!
Time to die! Αrren! Αnd you will join him.
Let her go!
Don't kill her! Αll who oppose me must die!
She's dead, she's dead.
Poor thing.
Sun is rising.
Hurry... must hurry...
Stop! Τherru! Εternal life!
Shadow, return to darkness!
Giνe me life!
I want life... life!
Life!
I want to liνe! Τehanu!
So you're safe too.
What about them? Τhey'll be fine. Τhey haνe wings. Τhank you... Τherru.
I'm going back to pay for my crime. Αnd to face myself. Αrren.
Can I come to see you again someday?
Come on.
We haνe to thank Sparrowhawk and Τenar.
THE END
MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO Dad, do you want some candy?
Thanks.
Aren't you tired?
No.
We're almost there.
Mei, hide!
It wasn't a policeman.
Hello!
Hello.
Are your parents around?
Thanks.
I'm Kusakabe!
We've just arrived!
A pleasure to meet you!
Welcome!
Thank you.
Here we are!
Wait!
Mei, there's a bridge!
A bridge?
See that flash?
Fish too!
So, you like it here?
Dad, it's terrific!
Look, a tunnel of trees!
Is that our house?
Come on!
It's a wreck!
Wreck!
Looks like a haunted house!
Haunted?
And it's all rotten!
It's gonna fall down!
Fall down!
Look, Mei!
See?
It's huge.
Dad, there's a huge tree!
It's a camphor tree.
Camphor tree!
Camphor tree!
Oops!
An acorn!
Show me.
Another one!
It's mine.
Out of the way.
I can't open the screens.
Acorns!
There are acorns in the house.
They fell from up there!
Maybe there are squirrels in here.
Squirrels, really?
Or rats; they like acorns too.
I'd rather have squirrels!
Where shall I put this?
Here, I'll get the door for you.
Satsuki, open up the kitchen.
Okay.
It's just round the back.
Mei, come on!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
Ready?
Bathtubs.
There's nothing here.
That's the bathroom.
Dad, there's something in here.
A squirrel?
Dunno.
A bunch of black things, but not roaches or mice.
Really?
Can you see them?
I think they were dust bunnies.
Dust bunnies?
Like in my picture book?
That's right.
Ghosts don't come out on days like this.
When you walk into a dark room from outside, your eyes dim and the dust bunnies come out.
Oh, I see.
Come here, dust bunnies.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Let's get to work!
See if you can find how to get upstairs.
Get up there and open all the windows.
Sure!
I'm coming, too!
Toilet!
Not here!
Not here!
Not here!
Not here!
Not here!
Not here!
Nothing here!
Nothing!
Mei, it's here!
It's pitch black!
Dust bunnies...
Another acorn.
Come out, dust bunnies!
Are you there, Mr.
Dust Bunny?
One, two...
One, two...
Dad, there's definitely something here!
That's exciting!
I've always wanted to live in a haunted house.
Oh, no!
I'm coming!
I got it.
Satsuki!
Mei.
You're full of energy!
This is Nanny.
She has come to look after the house.
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.
Nice to meet you both.
I'd have cleaned up if I'd known you'd be this quick.
No, you've done plenty.
I've been so busy in the rice paddies, I only did a bit of dusting...
What have you done to your hands?
The dust bunny got away.
Your feet, too!
Mine are black, too!
Well, well, well.
That must be the soot spreaders.
Those little, black, fuzzy things that fly?
That's right.
They breed in empty old houses, and cover them with soot and dust.
I could see them when I was little.
Now you can too, huh?
Are they like goblins?
No, nothing so scary.
If you keep smiling, they'll soon leave the house.
They're probably deciding where to go next, right now.
Mei, they're going away.
That's no fun.
What happens if a huge one comes out, like this?
I wouldn't be scared.
Okay then, I won't walk you to the bathroom at night.
Okay, cleaning time.
Could you get some water from the stream?
From the stream?
I'm coming, too!
Mei, wait there.
Did you get a fish?
Nanny, it's coming out!
Good, keep pumping 'til the water gets cold.
Okay!
May I help you?
Huh... my mom... for Granny.
Yes?
Wait, what is it?
Is that you, Kanta?
You live in a haunted house!
Kanta, stop it!
I did the same kind of thing when I was his age.
I hate boys.
But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!
Eat as much as you want.
Thank you!
Thank you so much for your help.
Goodbye!
Dad, the house is going to fall down.
I hope not; we've only just moved in.
Come on, let's laugh to keep the bogeymen away!
I'm not scared.
I mean it.
I'm not scared!
One, two...
Come on, keep up the good work.
Okay!
Washing, finished!
Here we go!
Nanny!
Hello!
Hard at work?
Where are you all heading?
To visit Mommy in the hospital!
That's nice.
Give her my regards!
Okay!
This way.
Hello.
Hello there.
Mommy!
So glad you came, my dear.
Daddy took the wrong road.
Really?
Hello, Satsuki.
It's a school holiday, today.
How nice.
Daddy is talking to the doctor.
It's so good to see you all.
Have you settled into the new house?
A haunted house?
Mom, do you like ghosts?
Of course I do!
I can't wait to see them.
See, I told you, Mei.
Mei was worried that you wouldn't like ghosts.
What about you two?
I love them!
I'm not scared of them!
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?
It's really good.
Lucky girl, Mei.
But she always gets mad at me. 'Cause you won't stay still.
Come here, Satsuki.
Isn't yours too short?
No, I like it like this.
Do mine, Mommy.
Mine, too.
Wait your turn!
Wavy hair, just like mine when I was your age.
Will it be like yours when I grow up?
Probably.
You take after your mom.
Mom looked really well.
You're right.
The doctor says she'll be home soon.
Soon?
Like tomorrow?
You always say that.
Tomorrow is a little too soon.
Mom said she'll sleep with me in my bed.
Weren't you saying you're big enough to sleep alone?
Mom is special!
Dad, time to get up!
Wake up!
Sorry, I overslept again.
I've got to bring a box lunch today.
I totally forgot about it.
It's all right.
I've made something for all of us.
It's burning.
Let me do it.
Here, this is yours, Mei.
It's for me!
Mei, sit down and eat!
Okay.
Here, wrap yours.
Satsuki!
Uh-oh.
I'm coming!
You made a friend already?
She's calling you!
Yeah, that's Michiko.
Gotta go!
See you!
Have a good day!
Morning!
Hi, let's go.
Hi!
Good morning!
Daddy!
Do I look all grown up?
Yes, dear.
Where are you going?
I'm just going out.
Daddy, is it lunch yet?
Already?
You be the flower shop, Daddy.
Pole-tads!
Got no bottom.
Gotcha!
Who are you?
A big dust bunny?
To-to-ro?
You're Totoro!
I bet you're Totoro.
Totoro.
See you!
Okay, catch you later!
I'm home!
Hey there.
Is it that late already?
Where's Mei?
I'm off to Michiko's.
We haven't eaten yet.
Is Mei in the garden?
Mei!
Mei!
Mei!
Mei!
Dad, I found her hat!
Mei?
Wake up, Mei!
You shouldn't sleep here!
Where's Totoro?
Totoro?
Where?
Were you dreaming?
Totoro was here.
You mean that troll in your picture book?
Yeah.
He was all hairy with a big mouth like this.
There's a tiny one and a little one and a huge one like this.
There you are.
What a great hiding place.
Dad, Mei said she saw a Totoro here.
A Totoro?
It's this way.
Hey, wait for me!
It's here.
Is it?
No.
It went to a big tree.
But there wasn't any other path.
Come back, Mei!
Mei!
Come back!
But it's true!
Totoro was here.
I'm not lying.
I know, Mei.
I didn't lie.
Neither of us think you're lying.
You probably met the king of this forest.
You were very lucky.
He doesn't come out very often.
We should go to the shrine to pay our respects.
Pay our respects?
To this forest.
Mei, you're getting heavy.
Dad, look!
The camphor tree!
What a big tree.
It's here!
Is that the tree?
Dad, hurry up.
The hole has gone.
Are you sure it was here?
The hole disappeared.
I told you that he doesn't come to see us often.
But will he come again?
I want to meet him, too.
If you're lucky, sure.
What a beautiful tree.
This tree must have stood here for years and years.
Trees and people used to be good friends.
I saw that tree and decided to buy the house.
I hope Mom likes it too.
Okay, let's pay our respects, then get home for lunch.
Oh yeah, I promised to go see Michiko!
I want to go, too!
Attention!
Thank you for looking after Mei.
Thank you very much!
Last one home's a rotten egg!
That's not fair!
Dad!
Wait!
Hurry up!
Wait for me!
Dear Mother, something amazing happened today.
Mei met a giant Totoro.
And I'm hoping to see him myself soon, too.
Kanta, hurry up!
You'll be late!
Coming...
WAIT, RIVER, PINE TREE Well, well!
Mei?
Excuse me!
Yes, Satsuki?
It's my sister...
Sister?
Where?
What happened, Nanny?
I'm sorry.
She insisted that she be with you.
It's Dad's day at the university.
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.
I still have two more classes and Nanny's too busy for this.
She was good up 'til now, weren't you?
I'll go talk to my teacher.
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital, I want you all to be nice to her.
Yes, Miss!
What's that?
It's Totoro.
Mei, you should keep quiet.
Okay.
See you!
Bye-bye, Mei!
I can't stay after class today.
We'll let teacher know.
See you!
Hurry up, it's going to rain!
Okay.
Here it comes!
Here.
I won't cry.
Aren't I good?
It's getting worse.
Dear Guardian Spirit, let us stay until the rain stops.
But...
That was lucky.
It's got holes in it.
Daddy forgot his umbrella.
I'm going, too.
I said I forgot it!
What idiot forgets his umbrella on a rainy day?
Ouch!
You broke it playing, I bet.
I did not!
Excuse me.
Hello, Satsuki.
Hi, Mei.
Grandma!
I'm sorry about Mei today.
Not at all.
Sorry we couldn't do more.
Kanta lent us this umbrella.
He did?
A broken old thing like that!
Mei was with me, so I was glad.
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.
Not at all.
It probably cleaned him up a little.
Are you off to meet your father?
Yes.
What good girls you are.
Bye-bye, Mei.
Bye-bye.
Who was that?
I don't know.
Just in time!
DESTINATION MAEZAWA, INARIMAE STATION TOKYO ELECTRIC RAILWAY BUS Getting on?
All right, drive on.
TOKYO BUS COMPANY Daddy wasn't on it.
He'll be on the next one.
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?
Are you okay?
Are you sleepy?
I told you.
Wanna go to Nanny's?
Not much longer.
Hang on.
It's late...
Come on.
Are you Totoro?
Wait a minute.
You can use this.
Take it, Mei's slipping off.
Hold it like this.
Here's the bus!
TSUKAMORI INARIMAE He took Daddy's umbrella.
I'm sorry.
Drive on.
The train was late and I missed the bus.
Were you worried?
We met him, Dad!
He was here!
And the cat bus!
What?
It was huge!
With big eyes like this!
We met him!
We met Totoro!
How wonderful!
Come on, Daddy.
Dear Mother, I can't tell you how excited I was today.
It was the scariest, funniest day I've ever had.
Totoro gave us a lovely present wrapped in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers.
When we opened it, it was full of magic nuts and seeds! "We decided to plant them in the garden to make a lovely forest." But they haven't sprouted yet.
Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.
She looks like a little crab.
CRAB MEI It's nearly summer vacation.
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon.
Love, Satsuki.
Come on.
Bed time.
Lights off!
Wait, Dad.
Daddy, do you think they will come out tomorrow?
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know.
Night night.
Wake up, Mei!
That's where we planted the seeds.
Wow, we did it!
We're the wind!
There are no trees!
Yes!
It was a dream.
But it wasn't a dream.
We did it!
Mr.
Kusakabe!
Telegram!
Mr.
Kusakabe!
Anyone home?
Nanny?
I'm here.
This one is ripe.
What about this one?
That's good, too.
Your garden is a treasure trove.
Let's take a little break.
These should be cold now.
Looks delicious.
So good.
The sun blessed these, so they're really good for you.
Would they help my mom?
Of course.
If she eats my vegetables, she'll get better right away.
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.
She'll sleep in my bed!
At last.
That's wonderful.
But it's only for a couple of days.
To get used to the new house.
I see.
We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.
I'll give her this corn I picked.
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.
I know.
There was a telegram for you.
For us?
Dad won't be back till late, what shall I do?
Open it, it might be important.
Please contact, hospital...
It's from Mom's hospital!
Something's happened to her!
Nanny!
What shall I do?
Calm down.
Do you know where your dad is?
I know his office number, but we don't have a telephone.
Kanta, take her to use the phone in the main house!
Mei, stay here with me!
Stay with Nanny, Mei!
Hello, I'd like to make a long-distance call.
It's Tokyo 31 1382.
A cute girl, Kanta.
Hello?
Yes?
Hello, may I speak to Dad...
Mr.
Kusakabe?
It's his daughter, Satsuki.
Daddy?
It's me, Satsuki!
Hello, what's wrong?
From the hospital?
Okay, I'll call them right away.
Is there anything wrong with Mom?
Don't worry.
I'll check up and call you right back.
I'll hang up now, stay there.
May I stay here until he calls back?
Stay as long as you like.
Satsuki!
No, this corn is for my mommy!
No, it's my mom's!
Listen, Mei.
Mom's not well, so she's not coming home this time.
No!
There's nothing we can do.
You don't want her to get worse, do you?
No!
It's just for a few more days.
No!
So you don't care if she dies?
No!
Stop being silly!
I'm going.
Let's go, Mei.
I hate you, Satsuki!
We should bring the washing in.
Don't worry too much, Satsuki.
Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.
Your dad said he'll stop by the hospital to check on her.
Besides, it's just a cold; she'll be back next week.
They said it was just a cold when she went into hospital.
But what if she dies!
Don't be silly, Satsuki.
Maybe Mom will...
Stop it.
Nobody would leave two pretty little girls like you.
There, there.
Don't cry.
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?
Mei!
Mei!
Mei!
Did she come back?
Wasn't she at the bus stop?
That's strange.
Where has she gone?
I was nasty to her, 'cause she was being silly...
Maybe she's heading for the hospital!
The hospital?
It would take a grown-up three hours!
I'll go look!
Kanta, hurry!
Tell your dad that Mei is missing!
Stupid Mei.
Always getting lost.
Mei!
Excuse me.
Have you seen a little girl pass by?
She's my sister.
No, I don't think so.
I'm sure I would've noticed.
Maybe she wasn't here.
Are you sure she came this way?
I don't know.
Mei!
Please, stop!
Idiot!
What are you doing?
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl?
Your little sister?
She's four.
I think she's heading to the hospital.
Did you see anyone?
No.
We just came from there, but we didn't see anyone.
Thanks anyway.
Where have you come from?
From Matsugo.
Matsugo?
Really?
Good luck.
Satsuki!
Kanta!
Find her?
No.
And you?
Dad and the others are looking for her.
I'll go to the hospital, you go back home.
I guess she got lost on the way to the hospital.
They found a sandal by the pond.
We're not sure if it's hers or not!
Did you find her?
Dear Lord, please protect her and...
It's too deep here, better search further away!
Hey, are there any poles left?
Grandma, Satsuki's here!
Nanny!
Look, is it hers?
No, it isn't.
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.
Nanny was jumping to conclusions.
It's not hers!
Where did she go then?
Let's start from scratch.
Hurry, before it gets dark.
I really appreciate your help, everyone.
It could've been any of us.
Someone should contact the police.
Please, help me, Totoro!
Mei is lost.
It'll be dark soon.
I'm sure she's scared somewhere.
Totoro!
Mei is lost and we can't find her!
She must be scared, please help me find her.
I don't know what to do.
They can't see the bus.
FOREST SWAMP CEMETERY SHRINE SANCTUARY LAKE MEI Mei!
The trees are moving out of the way!
MEI Mei!
Satsuki!
Satsuki!
Mei!
Mei!
Satsuki!
You silly girl.
I'm sorry.
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?
SHICHIKOKUYAMA HOSPITAL Will you take us there?
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry.
They didn't need to send a telegram just for a cold.
The girls must be worried.
I'm sorry to upset them.
They'll be fine.
As long as you're okay.
We've all learned to cope.
This will just postpone the enjoyment.
They've put up with it so well.
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki, she's so sensitive.
You're right.
I'm going to spoil them for a while when I come home.
Oh, no!
She's laughing!
Looks like she's fine.
I can't wait to get back on my feet.
Me too!
Look.
Where did that come from?
What?
I could swear I just saw Satsuki and Mei laughing up in that tree.
Maybe they were.
Look.
TO MOM THE END
Another village destroyed.
Let's go.
Soon this will also be consumed in the Sea of Decay. 1,000 YEARS AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION, A FOREST EXUDING TOXIC VAPORS, CALLED THE SEA OF DECAY, COVERED AN EARTH STREWN WITH RUSTING RUINS, THREATENING HUMAN SURVIVAL.
An Ohm's tracks.
They're still fresh.
An Ohm's shell.
Amazing.
I've never seen a perfect shell.
Lovely sound.
It chipped my ceramic sword.
The villagers will be pleased.
They'll have plenty to make into tools now.
What an eye.
I wonder if I can carry it.
It came free.
It's incredibly light.
Mushigo Palm spores.
So beautiful...
Though in this forest of death, your lungs would rot in five minutes without a mask.
Who is that?
What can it be?
My heart's pounding.
Those are gunshots.
An insect is attacking someone.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Over there!
What a thick spore cloud.
An Ohm!
That must have been its shell.
Don't run that way.
Look this way!
They answered!
They're coming.
Who's that?
What a magnificent Ohm.
Go upwind!
Thank you!
Return to the forest, Ohm.
This is not your world.
Be a good boy.
It's blinded by rage.
I've got to calm him.
The flares stunned it.
An insect charm.
Awaken, Ohm.
Return to the forest.
It's awake.
The Ohm's returning to the forest.
She tamed that Ohm with flares and an insect charm.
Lord Yupa!
Nausicaä.
I hardly recognized you.
It's been a year and half.
Father will be glad.
I must thank you.
You've become a great wind-rider.
Oh no, not according to Father.
Oh, of course.
I'd completely forgotten about him.
A fox-squirrel.
I've never seen one.
When a winged insect snatched him, I took him for a human child.
I had to fire my gun.
That's what enraged the Ohm.
He'd fainted, so was spared the poison.
Better not touch him.
Even young, they're savage.
Come.
Here.
Hey...
You're not scared.
You're not scared.
See... you're not scared.
See...
You were just frightened.
Lord Yupa, may I have him?
Why certainly.
Thank you.
Kai and Kui.
Remember me?
A mysterious power.
You must be tired.
You ran so far.
Is everyone well?
What's wrong?
My father...
He can no longer fly.
Jihl...
The forest poisons?
Yes.
He says it's the fate of those living by the Sea of Decay.
I should have come sooner.
Oh no.
Thank you for coming.
Lord Yupa, there's something I want to show you.
My secret room.
It's a secret.
I don't want to scare them.
I'll tell them you're coming.
Come soon!
Lord Yupa.
Would you carry this?
It's hard to fly with.
She certainly reads the wind well.
Not far now.
Oh...
Lord Yupa.
Welcome.
Are you in good health?
The waters and winds are clear and calm.
Lord Yupa.
Hello all, you're looking well.
Lord Yupa.
We've missed you.
Princess, he has come.
Wait.
Lord Yupa.
Old Mito, you're hard at work.
Tonight I'll hear tales of your travels.
OK, start it.
Seems to work.
Yes.
This is excellent.
Tomorrow, we'll send people to get the rest.
Come, Toeto.
Lord Yupa, this is Toeto's baby, born this year.
Oh, let's have a look.
A fine baby.
Reminds me of Nausicaä as a baby.
Please be her godfather.
Name her that a fair wind may favor her.
I will indeed.
I'll find her a fine name.
Thank you.
May she grow up as strong as our princess.
She's as strong as they come.
But we won't want her playing in the Sea of Decay.
But that's where I found the Ohm shell.
Put yourself in my shoes.
I'm responsible for this castle.
She's made me sick with worry.
Let her play in the Sea of Decay if she finds us Ohm shells.
Indeed, her presence there saved me.
Saved by the girl?
This is a fine valley.
Being here calms my spirits.
How was your journey?
It was terrible.
The Sea of Decay consumed two more countries to the south.
It's spreading all the time.
And yet, war and hunger are everywhere.
Nothing but bad omens.
Why can't they live as you do in this valley?
The ocean winds protect our valley.
The Sea of Decay can't reach us here.
What do you say, Yupa?
Isn't it time you settled in this valley?
Look at my condition.
It would please everyone.
Don't bother.
Yupa's a man who is fated to search forever.
Fate, huh...
Obaba, what's he searching for?
Oh my, don't you know, Nausicaä?
Look, see the tapestry on the wall...
I can no longer see it.
The figure in the left corner. "...clothed in blue robes, descending onto a golden field, to join bonds with the great Earth and guide the people to the pure land, at last." Lord Yupa, I always thought that was only a legend.
You mustn't tease me, Obaba.
It's the same thing.
I only wish to solve the Sea of Decay's mysteries.
Are we humans but a tribe destined to be swallowed and ruined by the Sea of Decay?
That is what I wish to know.
If only I could help Lord Yupa...
Princess, Princess.
What is it, Mito?
A strange scent on the wind.
It's nearly dawn.
I'll be right there.
How is it?
It's one fine storm, but something's amiss.
Over there!
Look!
It's a ship.
Why would a ship be here?
What is it?
Lord Yupa.
It's a ship.
A ship!
It's coming closer.
It's huge!
It's a Tolmekian ship.
It's not flying right.
It's an emergency landing.
Help me up, Gol.
Okay.
Princess, you must not!
I'll guide them to the shore.
It's coming about.
Off you go!
Teto!
How dare they!
They must have landed earlier and killed some insects.
Turn away!
You'll crash!
Turn away!
Turn!
The princess.
The cliffs.
Let's go!
Everyone to the rescue.
Even the boys!
It's that girl.
She's alive.
Where am I?
The Valley of the Wind.
Save your strength.
My name is...
Lastel of Pejite.
My cargo...
Burn the cargo...
The cargo...
Please, burn it.
Your cargo, I understand.
Don't worry.
It's all in flames.
Thank goodness.
Princess!
That's...
The Princess of Pejite.
An insect!
An Ushiabu's alive.
Oh no, it's calling its friends.
It can't fly.
Bring guns!
No, if you shoot it, it'll call others.
I'll kill it now.
Guns won't kill an Ushiabu.
Then what?
Wait.
Mito, bring my glider.
Princess!
Return to the forest.
You're strong, you can fly.
That's a good boy.
Princess.
Thanks.
Thank God.
No telling how we'd suffer for even one insect's death.
An Ohm...
Found one!
Come!
Here!
So, those were spores stuck to that ship.
They haven't released any toxins yet.
We're almost done.
We can't miss a single one.
What on earth is this?
The fire didn't destroy it...
Leave this mystery for later, folks.
Go and help burn the spores.
Alright.
Be careful, now.
Why did they bring this bundle of trouble here?
Mito, look here.
It's pulsing.
Almost like it's alive.
Lord Yupa, what is this?
On my journey, I heard ominous rumors that a monster from the old world that had slept beneath Pejite had been unearthed.
A monster from the old world?
Giant Warriors.
The Giant Warriors!
They say they were destroyed in the Seven Days of Fire.
This...
The Giant Warriors were all said to have turned to stone.
But a single one slept in the earth for a thousand years.
In...
In a way, the thing looks almost human.
Tolmekia's a savage military state, far to our west.
And remember the Pejite captive who perished...
Keep up the good work.
What's that?
Tolmekian ships!
Everyone to the castle!
To the castle!
Gather in the castle!
The castle!
Father!
Obaba, hide yourself.
I'll stay right where I am.
Princess!
How dare you?
Nausicaä...
Stay where you are!
Move, and this sword carved of insect shell will pierce your ceramic armor.
That's Yupa.
I ask you Tolmekian warriors.
Last night, these villagers toiled desperately to save one of your ships.
We have just now gently laid one of your dead to rest.
Is this how you Tolmekians treat such a nation, however weak?
If you would make war, you must have reasons.
You should first send a messenger to declare them.
Nausicaä...
Be calm, Nausicaä.
If you fight now, they will slaughter the villagers.
We must survive, wait for our chance.
You... little wench.
Put it down, Kurotowa.
But...
Look at this mess.
Killed them all.
Your rebuke stings.
Are you Yupamiralda, the greatest swordsman of this region?
We have not come to slaughter.
We wish to talk.
Lay down your sword.
The princess!
Princess!
Listen well!
Her Highness Kushana, Division Commander of the Tolmekian Frontier Forces will speak.
We have come to unify the frontier nations and build peace in this region.
You live on the brink of extinction beside the Sea of Decay.
Accept our rule, and join our enterprise.
We shall burn away the Sea of Decay and resurrect the Earth!
Burn away the Sea of Decay.
Is that possible?
We have revived the miraculous skills and power that once allowed humans to rule this Earth.
For those who submit to us, I promise a life free from fear of the toxins and insects of that swamp.
Wait!
You must not harm the Sea of Decay.
What's that, you old hag?
Take her away.
Let her speak.
In the thousand years of the Sea of Decay, countless times have humans sought to burn it away.
Yet, each time, herds of Ohms, blind with rage, have swarmed the Earth like a tidal wave.
Destroying nations, swallowing cities, the Ohms' rage would not quiet until they starved to death.
In time, the spores took root in the Ohms' rotting flesh and engulfed our vast Earth in this Sea of Decay.
You must not touch the Sea of Decay.
Enough!
No more of your ravings.
Ah!
What will you do?
Kill me, too?
You!
Kill me if you will!
Easy work to murder an old blind woman.
Just as you murdered Jihl.
Not Jihl!
How cruel!
He was helpless!
You murderer!
Shut them up!
Show no mercy to impudence!
Wait, everyone!
Please listen to me.
I don't want any more sacrifices.
Please.
Princess...
You, too, Obaba.
We must submit to these people.
Step on it.
We're almost there!
Hurry up.
It really is a lovely valley.
I'm against it.
We have orders to send the Giant Warrior back at once.
An order we can't possibly fulfill.
Even our biggest ship collapsed from its weight.
But you can't be serious about building a nation here.
And what if I am?
You expect me to hand over that monster as a toy for those fools?
You have a point.
I am but a simple soldier.
Such a decision is beyond my position.
You're a sly fox.
While I'm in Pejite, your priority is to revive that Giant Warrior.
Yes.
Can this gun ship fly?
Yes, we found it here.
Get this straight.
I'm not asking you.
But take the princess to Pejite.
Five hostages, the gunship, and food.
You pick the hostages.
Prepare everything for the morning.
Thanks for going as a hostage.
We're fine, but look.
They're taking everything in sight.
I will slip away, return in secret, and await my chance.
We must prevent that monster's resurrection.
Yes.
Nausicaä.
Teto, where is she?
Nausicaä!
What on earth is this?
These plants are from the Sea of Decay.
I've grown them from spores I collected.
Don't worry, they're not toxic.
Not toxic...
The air here is pure indeed, but...
Why... with this deadly poisonous plant blooming?
The castle windmill draws water from deep within the earth.
The sand, too, comes from the very bottom of the well.
With pure water and soil, the plants from the Sea of Decay are not poisonous.
The pollution lies in the earth itself.
Even the earth of our valley.
Why...
Who made such a terrible mess of the world?
Did you do this all yourself?
Yes.
To cure my father's illness and that of others.
But...
I'm closing it down.
I just shut off the water, and they'll soon wither and die.
Nausicaä.
I frighten myself.
I don't know what my rage will make me do.
I don't want to kill anyone.
Princess.
We gathered these for you.
Chiko nuts.
They're for you.
All of you...
So many.
You've worked very hard.
Thank you.
They're very precious.
It's not fair, Princess.
All aboard!
We're taking off.
There, now.
You mustn't cry.
Don't worry.
I'll be home in no time.
Really?
Why, have I ever lied to you?
No.
Right?
Yeah.
Promise?
Yes.
Go along, it's dangerous.
OK.
You promised!
Take care of the princess!
Aren't we in Pejite yet?
My back is killing me.
Boy, oh boy, did the princess ever pick a bunch of losers.
Hey, isn't this strange?
Why do they fly so close together?
Like they're afraid of an attack.
Toxins swirl below the clouds.
Don't move.
A gunship!
Enemy fire!
They've hit ship number 2!
I told you so.
Wow, terrifying!
Defense formation!
That's a Pejite gun ship.
Pejite!
Damn!
They got number 3.
What's the Korvet doing?
Their ships just crumble.
Oh no, he's hit our tail.
The Barge tether snapped.
Hurry, Teto.
Oh no, we're going down.
Princess!
Stop!
No more killing!
No more!
Princess.
Hurry, Mito!
It burns!
Princess, we're doomed.
Maybe I can fly it.
Are you crazy?
Hurry, Mito!
What?
Right!
Start the engine!
Blast open the door!
Yes!
Come!
Hurry.
Get inside.
Mito, ready?
Ready or not!
Full throttle when we take off!
Roger!
Ready!
Go!
Put on the toxin mask.
Drop below the clouds to find the Barge.
You're still warm.
Don't give up, Teto.
What is this place?
I've never seen such dense toxins.
Keep an eye on the right tail.
It's nearby.
It's still aloft.
Hey!
You're right!
There it is!
It's the princess!
Princess!
Don't give up, everyone.
I'll throw you a rope.
Our hook's broken.
You can't hook us in mid-air.
I don't want to crash and become insect food!
We'll leap to our deaths!
Don't panic!
Ditch your cargo.
Goodbye.
Farewell!
Listen to me!
Toss your cargo!
Kill the rear engine.
What?
The engine noise is too loud.
Hurry!
Yes!
What?
Princess...
What are you...?
Your mask, Princess!
You'll die!
Put your mask on!
I promise you'll be safe.
Trust me and dump that cargo.
We'll do whatever you say.
Please!
Put your mask back on!
The princess is smiling.
We're going to be all right.
Hurry!
Lose the cargo.
Princess, we're in a nose-dive!
Re-start the engines!
I inhaled.
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry up!
Princess!
Everyone safe?
Don't move!
You!
Thanks for saving me.
Why did you save her, Princess?
You're a fool.
You thought I would grovel in gratitude?
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay.
It isn't like the human world.
There's no knowing what a single gunshot will bring.
That battle hurled ships into this forest.
The insects are furious.
Look up.
The Yamma are sentries.
They'll quickly bring other insects.
We must escape now.
Throw me your extra rope.
Yes!
Mito, fix the hook.
Don't move.
I give the orders.
What are you so afraid of?
You're just like a lost fox-squirrel.
How dare you?
Don't be afraid.
We just want you to go back to your own country.
You...
They're here!
Quiet!
Don't anger them.
This is an Ohm's nest!
We're surrounded.
They're examining us.
Forgive us, Ohm, for disturbing your nest.
Please understand, we're not your enemies.
Princess!
He's still alive.
Wait, Ohm!
What's happening?
Their eyes have turned blood-red.
What will you do with the glider?
When the waters quiet, take off, and wait for me above.
If I'm not back in one hour, return to the valley.
But...
Princess!
She's gone.
Hand it over.
All right, everyone.
We'll do as the Princess said.
Princess...
Damn!
Who are you?
You think only of killing.
My flares and charms won't help now.
It's quicksand!
Damn!
It's been two hours already.
More and more insects.
Princess!
Princess!
Nausicaä.
Nausicaä.
Come here.
Come here.
Father.
Mother's here, too.
No, I don't want to go.
Stay away!
There's nothing here.
I said, there's nothing!
Stay inside.
It's a baby Ohm.
She's being used by the insects.
Give it to me, Nausicaä.
No!
It's not doing anything bad.
Insects and humans can't live in the same world.
Please, don't kill it!
Please!
Teto...
What a strange place.
Hey!
I finally found it.
How are you feeling?
Where are we?
First, let me thank you.
I'm Asbel of Pejite.
Thank you for saving me.
I'm Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.
Where are we?
No wonder you're surprised.
We're beneath the Sea of Decay.
Beneath the Sea of Decay?
Look, we fell from up there, along with the sand.
We're not wearing masks.
That's right.
The air here is pure.
I couldn't believe it myself, finding this place under the Sea of Decay.
What is it?
Nausicaä, don't wander too far.
What a wonderful tree.
Even though it's dead, water still flows through it.
Just like the sand at the bottom of our well.
Grains of petrified wood sifting down from above.
Nausicaä.
Are you crying?
Yes.
I'm so happy.
Lastel was my twin sister.
I should have been with her.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
Oh no...
I'm sorry.
I nearly killed the person who eased my sister's pain.
I see...
So it's in the Valley of the Wind.
This nut tastes really weird.
It's a chiko nut.
It's really good for you.
It doesn't taste great, but I could eat a whole boot-full!
Why the Sea of Decay was born...
You think the strangest thoughts.
The trees of the Sea of Decay grew to cleanse a world polluted by humans.
They absorb toxins from the earth, generate pure crystals, die, and turn to sand.
That's what created these underground caverns.
The insects protect this forest.
In that case, we're doomed.
We can't possibly survive, living in terror of toxins and insects for thousands of years.
At least we can find a way to keep it from spreading.
You sound just like Kushana.
No!
We don't plan to use the Giant Warriors!
You'll see when you meet my friends tomorrow.
Let's go to sleep.
We have far to go tomorrow.
All is well.
On schedule?
Yes!
The torso is solidifying well.
You're one cute monster.
Makes a poor soldier think of dusting off old ambitions.
It's grinning.
You should've slept beneath the earth until the end of time.
Counselor!
Her Highness' planes were attacked by Pejite survivors.
All crashed, except the Korvet.
What about Her Highness?
Her ship exploded in flight.
Counselor.
The villagers don't know yet?
No.
OK, we'll head out.
You stay here and keep working.
Yes!
Either fortune's finally smiling on this lowly soldier... or it's a trap set to destroy me.
Mito and the others have returned.
They're waiting at Acid Lake.
In shame we return without her.
No, no, I'm pleased you're safe.
Releasing me?
Drown the Giant Warrior deep in Acid Lake and return to your country.
Few of your soldiers remain here.
We could easily start a fight, but why sacrifice more people?
Fire and water are powerless against it, and it's only a matter of time before it starts to walk.
Don't you see?
It's far too late to turn back.
My orders to invade Pejite were motivated by fear that another country had harnessed its strength.
Once its presence here is known, the great powers will send their armies.
You have but one choice left.
Revive the Giant Warrior, defy both great powers, and learn to live with that thing.
Look.
An insect did that?
Whoever becomes my husband will see worse than that.
Burn the Sea of Decay, kill the insects, and restore the human world.
Why do you hesitate?
Steal it from us, just as we stole it from Pejite.
We shall not give the Giant Warrior life.
Emergency!
What's the password?
I'm in a hurry!
Wind.
Valley!
OK.
Some spores survived!
What?
They're spreading toxins and the valley's going crazy!
Hand them over.
Give it to us!
Hurry up!
Hurry, or the valley's doomed.
We need our tools back.
They're spreading as we speak!
The tools that burn spores can also be used as weapons.
We have no choice.
Release everything but their guns.
The Korvet's taking off.
Get through this time.
Summon all our troops from Pejite to this valley.
Yes, sir.
Good grief, now this is a real mess.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Find the princess.
Look after the valley.
Be careful until we return.
We're going to the valley.
It's no use, the spores are already here.
And on this side, too.
Move!
What are you doing?
Oh no, here, too.
Obaba.
We've no choice but to burn it.
This forest is doomed.
If we hesitate, the Sea of Decay will consume our valley.
Isn't there anything to be done?
This forest guarded the reservoir for three centuries.
Damn!
If only they'd never come.
This is getting out of hand.
Let's go help them.
Do you think so?
I think it looks the same as ever.
The insects have gone.
I wonder why my heart's pounding so hard.
We're almost there.
My friends are just over that mountain.
Pejite looks strange.
What is that haze?
Asbel, your mask.
Insects!
All dead.
Head for Pejite.
Be careful, the Tolmekian army must be there.
Even an Ohm...
It attacked the Great Dome.
Pejite's finished.
They wiped out the Tolmekians, but this is...
They wiped out?
What do you mean, Asbel?
It's a Brig.
My friends' ship!
They're landing.
Let's go!
Asbel!
You're alive!
What have you done?
We can't rebuild it.
You've seen the city.
Don't worry, if the Sea of Decay swallows it, we'll burn it away.
But the Giant Warrior isn't here.
I know, it's in the Valley of the Wind.
How did...?
We haven't exactly been idle.
We've launched our second phase.
We'll wipe out the Tolmekians in the valley tonight.
What?
What are you going to do?
Who's this, Asbel?
Nausicaä from the Valley of the Wind.
I owe her my life.
Valley of the Wind...
Tell me, what will happen?
You must know, Asbel!
Tell me.
They'll provoke an insect attack.
So you made them attack Pejite, too!
You're horrible!
We simply have to recover the Giant Warrior before they revive it.
We're doing it to save the world.
Please understand.
And so you'll murder everyone in the valley!
Stop it!
Call it off!
Please!
It's too late.
Once they've started, no one can stop them.
We've lost most of our people to the Tolmekians.
This is the only way.
Let go!
Let me fly!
Stop it!
It's horrible now, but the Giant Warrior will purge the Sea of Decay and rebuild the human world.
Liar!
You're just like the Tolmekians.
No, they want to use it for destruction.
You drink water from the wells, too.
Do you know what purifies that water?
The trees in the Sea of Decay cleanse all the lakes and rivers that humans polluted!
And you want to destroy that!
Why did you dig up that Giant Warrior?
What choice do we have?
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?
Never, never!
Tell them, Asbel, how the Sea of Decay came to be.
How the insects protect this world!
Please, Asbel!
What are you doing?
Don't move!
Release her.
Calm down, Asbel.
I'm serious.
Release her.
Nausicaä, go, and warn them!
Asbel.
Let me go!
Fools.
No stopping fighting once it starts.
But he warned us to be careful.
Quit dawdling and use the tanks to rescue our men.
Counselor!
They got the last man!
Coming our way?
I don't know.
The whole village is gathering.
Why do they go berserk over a little forest or two?
Just as it was with Pejite.
They got our tank!
Hurry, get it moving.
Don't panic.
Incoming fire!
Forward!
Hurry up!
Maybe this is it?
It's moving!
Which way?
Forward, move forward.
I know that.
Damn!
Mobilize all the tanks.
She survived.
So much for my dreams.
Your Highness!
We'll hold them off here.
Lead everyone to safety by Acid Lake.
All right.
It's just until the princess returns with the gunship.
Hurry, everyone!
Stop gawking, and help me.
My aching back.
The tanks are coming!
Hurry!
Faster!
I know that.
Are you sure?
It's a Pejite Brig.
I saw it peeking through the clouds.
OK!
Watch out, she's a wild one.
Quickly.
Nausicaä, you may go free.
Go warn your valley.
Your glider may get you there in time.
It's waiting.
Asbel told me everything.
I'll take your place.
Put this on.
You're...
Lastel's mother.
Thank you.
I'm so very sorry.
Everything we've done is wrong.
Hurry!
What about her?
She'll be all right, don't worry.
Be careful.
We've treated you so badly.
Over here, Nausicaä.
Come.
Hurry.
Thank you, everyone!
Sorry it took so long.
Can you launch from here?
I'll try.
A Korvet!
Take cover in the clouds!
Stop firing!
Idiots!
Nothing but wind and lightning in there.
It's useless!
I've lost control!
The ship is breaking apart.
We have to leave the clouds and fight.
They were expecting us.
What are they up to?
Forcing us into the clouds so they can board us.
Here they come.
This is your last chance.
No, I'll stay with you.
I can't abandon all those people and the girl who took my place.
Only you can save your people.
Please, go, for our sakes!
The ship is ours.
Take no prisoners.
Destroy them.
Go, Nausicaä!
Asbel!
Princess!
Mito!
Mito!
Lord Yupa!
Princess.
Hurry, everyone's in!
I'll engage the hook now.
Lord Yupa, that red lever!
This is their last stronghold.
The door won't hold.
Anytime.
Show them some Pejite pride.
What is that?
A bird?
A ship, a gunship from the valley.
What?
You...
It's Lord Yupa.
Here's a chance for glory!
Surrender.
Your Korvet won't be back.
This guy's tough.
Princess, you're crazy.
The engine will blow.
Just make it to the valley.
Speed up!
Dear God, God of the Wind, please protect my people.
They won't budge.
They're waiting for her return.
Return?
They believe that girl will return with their gunship.
That gunship is a pain.
It's our chance to attack.
Do you know what that ship is?
It's from before the Seven Days of Fire.
The one they say went as far as the stars.
It's too strong for our guns, but bury it in a hole...
I, too, wish to wait.
If she really does return from deep in the Sea of Decay...
I'd like a chance to really talk to her.
Made up your minds?
If you'll aid our attack, I'll let you go.
You want to end up like Pejite?
You're a princess, too.
You're nothing like our princess.
Look at my hand.
That's what King Jihl had.
In six more months it will be stone.
But our princess said she liked these hands.
They were the beautiful hands of a hard worker.
You want to live with the Sea of Decay even as its toxins ravage you?
You use fire.
We use it a bit, too.
Too much fire, and nothing will grow.
Fire can turn the forest into ashes in a single day.
Water and wind sustain a forest for a hundred years.
We like the water and the wind.
The sight of our forest will grieve the princess.
Counselor, we await your orders.
Shut up.
Yes, sir.
Who knows what happened, but she sure looks cute.
Let them go, Kurotowa!
Huh?
You want to wait?
Feed the soldiers.
We attack in one hour.
Food, huh?
Finally, a real meal.
Someone's coming!
It's Gol and the others.
What is it?
There's no wind.
No wind?
You're right, the wind's stopped.
Obaba, what is it?
Obaba.
Someone...
Someone take me outside...
The wind's never stopped before.
Obaba, my ears hurt.
The air...
The very air is thick with rage.
We're close!
We're clear of the Sea of Decay!
Three minutes to Acid Lake!
Idle the engines.
Drop beneath the clouds.
What's this glow?
Ohms!
The Sea of Decay is spreading.
They're headed for the valley.
How did they stampede the Ohms?
Someone's baiting them.
Mito!
Turn towards Sirius.
Yes!
It's there.
Mito, a flare!
Ready.
Fire!
What is that?
How cruel.
They're baiting them with a baby.
I'll shoot them down!
No, Mito!
Don't shoot!
Why not?
Why shouldn't I?
Kill the baby, and the stampede will never end!
What can we do?
They'll destroy the valley.
Calm down, Mito.
Return the baby to them.
Let's try.
What are you doing, Princess?
You go ahead and warn them.
Princess!
You're not even armed.
That's not one of our flares.
How far?
Twenty leagues.
The other side of the lake.
Is it a gunship?
Probably.
That's a distress signal.
It's definitely the gunship.
It's been an hour, let's go.
Why not wait?
The bloodshed is inevitable.
Infantry advance.
Your Highness, get inside.
I'm fine here.
The gunship!
Fire!
Hold your fire!
Stop it!
Stop!
Princess!
Stand by.
Don't fire.
Your Highness.
Where's the girl?
The princess!
She's not here.
The Ohm, a stampede.
It's coming this way.
What?
The Ohm!
The Princess stayed behind to stop them.
This is no time for battle.
Everyone run, find the highest place you can!
Now!
Obaba, I see a red glow.
It's spreading.
It's coming this way.
You hold on tight.
There's no stopping them now.
Don't panic.
Don't push.
Calm down.
It's okay!
Hurry!
There's still time.
If I have to die, I want to die in the valley.
No, you mustn't give up, not while the princess has faith.
Listen, hold them off as long as you can.
I'll return soon.
Your Highness, not that...
It's not ready yet!
If not now, when?
Go!
Don't shoot!
Listen to me!
Damn!
She flies like a bird.
She's not an enemy.
She wants to say something.
Anyone who interferes is an enemy.
We'd better drop the bait in the valley soon or die ourselves.
Here she comes!
Let her come in close, then fire.
Now!
Fire!
No!
That's Lastel!
Move!
Ohm...
Don't be angry.
Don't be frightened.
I'm not your foe.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I can't ask your forgiveness.
It's too cruel.
Don't move!
You'll bleed to death.
Be good, little one, keep still.
They've found us.
They're coming.
Stop!
Not with those wounds!
The lake is poison.
You...
Good baby.
I'm fine.
They're coming for you.
They're turning away.
Ohm!
Don't!
The valley's that way.
They're lost in their rage.
If I don't calm them, the valley...
Fools!
Drawing them with their own fire.
We're safe.
We'd better get away.
Check the engine.
No, no!
We can discuss this.
Take us to them.
I must give them the baby.
What's the point, it's too late.
They'll never stop.
Drop us in front of them, then.
Take us.
But you'll die, too.
Obaba, will we all die?
If that's our fate, we must accept it.
They don't even waver.
Let's retreat.
Idiot!
There's nowhere to go.
Don't retreat!
Hold your ground for Her Highness.
Highness...
Your Highness!
Get them!
The Giant Warrior...
Giant Warrior.
It's rotting.
It's too soon.
Burn them!
What's wrong?
Are you not descended from Earth's most evil tribe?
Incredible...
No wonder the world caught fire.
Your Highness Kushana, hurray!
Destroy them!
What's wrong with you?
Hurry up and fire!
We're done for.
The Giant Warrior is dead.
It's for the best.
The Ohm's rage is the fury of the Earth itself.
There's no reason to live if our lives depend on a monster.
Princess!
The princess!
Not there.
It's madness.
Princess!
The Ohms are changing color.
Their rage has vanished.
They stopped.
The Ohms stopped.
Princess!
The princess is dead.
She calmed them with her own life.
She saved our valley.
Look...
What is that light?
Teto...
Wonderful.
Thank you, Ohm.
Thank you.
It's a miracle.
A miracle.
Such friendship and sympathy.
The Ohms have opened their hearts.
Children, watch well, and tell me what I cannot see.
The Princess is wearing strange blue clothes.
It's like she's walking through golden fields. "...clothed in blue robes, descending onto a golden field..." Obaba...
The ancient legend was true.
Look!
The glider.
The wind!
The wind has returned.
THE END
Now the latest weather forecast for northwest Koriko.
Skies are clearing up, thanks to a high-pressure front moving in from the continent.
Mild winds will be blowing in from the northwest clearing out the clouds by this evening.
We'll also have a beautiful full moon tonight.
Tomorrow: fair.
Day after tomorrow: fair.
More news in just a minute.
First, a word from today's sponsor-- Jiji, I've decided!
Tonight's the night!
RING BELL FOR WITCH, KOKIRI Mom!
Oh, hi, Miss Dora.
It's gonna be clear tonight.
I heard the weather forecast.
There's gonna be a big full moon.
Did you borrow your father's radio without permission again?
It's okay, isn't it?
Happy to see you, Miss Dora.
Mom, my mind's made up.
It's tonight.
Weren't you going to put it off a month?
But the next full moon might be on a cloudy night.
I want to leave on the perfect night.
Kiki, wait!
My, my.
What's this leaving business?
It's one of our old customs.
At 13, a witch leaves home for a year of training.
Your little baby is 13?
My, my.
Time flies so quickly, doesn't it?
I'm afraid so.
But nobody leaves home that young anymore.
I remember perfectly well the day you arrived in this town.
A little 13-year-old girl came down from the sky riding a broomstick, her eyes shining.
I thought you were a bit full of yourself.
But Kiki has much to learn.
She hardly knows any of my potions.
After I'm gone, who will make this medicine?
Sign of the times, I'm afraid.
Everything changes, bit by bit.
But I have to say, nothing works as well for my rheumatism.
You're always telling me to hurry!
Now who's the slowpoke?
I think it's better to leave with decorum and great dignity.
If we put it off for a month, and I find some wonderful boyfriend, then what?
We'll never leave!
I'm worried.
Once you've decided, you can't go back.
Of course.
I know that.
Good.
It's there.
I'm so excited!
It's like getting a birthday present!
Dad!
I've decided to go away tonight!
Tonight?
Yeah!
I just decided!
Well, yes, but what about our camping trip for this weekend?
Sorry, Dad!
This won't do at all!
Yes.
I'll expect you then.
Thanks.
Hi, Mom.
I wanted to make sure you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.
Yes, at midnight.
Not bad.
I wish it were a different color.
Witches have always worn this color.
Black cat, black clothes.
It doesn't matter what color your dress is.
What matters is the heart inside it.
I know that having a good heart is very important.
I wish I could show you that my heart is ready.
Just follow that heart and keep smiling.
Okay.
Be sure to write home as soon as you've found a place.
Dad, can I please take the radio?
Mom, you said I could have his radio.
Yeah!
Well, the radio is yours now.
Okay.
Now let me have a look at my little witch.
You look just like your mother.
Dad... would you pick me up like you used to?
Well...
Why didn't you tell me you were growing up so fast?
You can always come home if things don't work out.
Come back to my old room?
No, thanks.
I hope you find a good town.
I bet it's real tough to find a town to live in by yourself.
Don't worry.
Kiki will be fine.
What kind of town are you looking for?
A big town?
Yeah.
By the ocean, I hope.
Wow!
I'm so jealous of you!
But I'm not going for a good time.
I'll be in training for a year.
Yeah, but they'll have discos, right?
Kiki, it's almost time.
Okay!
That's the broom you're taking?
Yeah.
I just made it.
Pretty cute, huh?
It's cute, but you can't start on a broom that's too small.
Take mine.
But, Mom, that one's so old.
That's why you should have it.
It never loses its way, even in a storm.
Kiki, trust me.
But I worked so hard on it.
Right, Jiji?
Your mother's broom would be better.
Traitor.
He's right.
You can make yourself another broom when you get settled down.
Be careful.
Go get 'em.
Bye.
Go, go, Kiki!
Go, go, Kiki!
She still hasn't got the hang of it.
She's well past the lake and doing just fine.
I'm going to miss the sound of those little bells.
Which way are we headed?
I think south, to the ocean.
Climb up and turn on the radio.
I don't think I can.
KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE Good evening!
It was.
Newcomer, I suppose.
I must be.
I just left home tonight.
Would you mind turning off that music?
I prefer to fly without accompaniment.
Is it hard to get settled into a place you've never been?
Oh, yes.
Lots can go wrong.
But since I'm a fortune-teller, I can handle anything.
Fortunes?
In fact, I've started telling fortunes about love.
What's your special skill?
I haven't made up my mind yet.
Well, I'm nearly finished with my training period.
It'll be terrific to go home with confidence.
That's my town down there.
It's not big or very interesting, but I like it.
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
Goodbye!
Disgusting.
What a stuck-up cat.
I need a special skill.
What was that about good weather?
Don't tell me you are going to...
We'll sleep here until the storm passes.
Won't we get into trouble?
Not if nobody finds us.
I'm soaked through.
Do you feel anything moving?
This smells great.
Sorry.
We didn't mean to fall asleep in your breakfast.
Jiji, come see the ocean.
I don't believe it!
It's huge!
It's only a puddle to me.
Aw, come on.
That one's giant.
Think there might be other witches there?
How would I know?
Let's go!
You all right back there?
Look.
A big town floating on the sea.
Just as I hoped.
A clock tower and everything!
What if there are some witches living here already?
There may not be.
I'm gonna like it here!
It's a trifle large for my taste.
Bless my hourglass!
If that ain't a witch!
Good morning!
Are there any other witches in this town?
No.
Can't say I've seen a single one of 'em lately.
How about that?
Let's settle down right here.
Thanks, mister!
Bye!
Don't mention it!
Tell me we're not landing there.
Of course we are.
Everybody's staring.
I know.
Smile and make a good first impression.
Well, you see, I'm a witch.
My name is Kiki.
This is my black cat, Jiji.
We'd be honored to live here.
We'd love to live here.
You have a wonderful bell tower.
We're glad you like it, my dear.
Hey, kid, why did you jump into the street like that?
You almost caused an accident.
You must be crazy, zooming around on a broom in public.
I'm a new witch, sir.
We're supposed to fly around.
You're supposed to obey the law the same as other people.
What's your name and address?
Are you gonna tell my parents?
Of course, if it's necessary.
I have to.
You're a minor.
Thief!
Somebody stop him!
Stop, thief!
Don't you move from there!
Kiki.
Wait up!
It worked out pretty good, huh?
Good plan to get rid of that cop, huh?
I was the one yelling, "Thief!" You're a real witch, right?
I saw you flying.
Could I look at that broom?
Hey, Tombo!
Isn't it a bit early for girl hunting?
Hey, you guys, shut up.
Whoa!
Let me look at your broom.
Please?
Just for a minute.
I didn't ask for your help.
I guess I have to thank you, but it was rude for you not to introduce yourself first.
How old-fashioned.
You sound like my grandma.
Just leave me alone!
What a cool witch.
Stay here alone?
I don't understand.
Aren't your parents here with you?
No.
I'm a witch, so since I'm 13, I'm supposed to be independent.
May I see some identification?
Never mind then.
Are you going to eat that?
You can have it.
It's going to be getting dark soon.
Let's go.
Let's just find another town.
There must be a nicer one.
Lady!
Your pacifier!
Lady, you forgot this!
When that baby wakes up and doesn't find this, he's gonna cry.
I'm sorry, sir, but could you wait just a minute?
I'll be right back.
I could bring it down to her.
What?
The woman with the baby carriage, right?
That'd be a big help.
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Let's go, Jiji.
Wow!
Sorry to startle you, but you left this in the bakery.
Here you go.
The usual?
Hi!
Come on in!
Thank you.
Next!
Thank you.
Bye.
Take care.
I must say, I nearly fainted when I saw you fly off.
That lady told me to give you this. "I got the pacifier you sent.
Thank you!" I guess I should be going.
Wait!
Where are you going so fast?
I want to thank you.
Come up here.
Sit down and relax.
I'll make us some coffee.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
And this is for you.
I see.
You need to find your own town.
Yes, but people don't seem fond of witches in this town.
There are many kinds of people in a big town like this.
Take me, for instance.
I like you very much.
Found a place to stay yet?
You should have told me you hadn't.
We have a vacant room in the attic you can stay in.
You'd give me a room?
I'd be happy to.
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Osono.
My name's Kiki.
This is my black cat, Jiji.
It's not very clean, but it's all yours.
Thanks.
Bathroom and water are downstairs.
Don't hesitate to ask for anything.
Thank you!
There's flour everywhere.
At this rate, I'll be a white cat by morning.
Jiji, come look at the ocean from here.
Shall we try to find another town?
The Freedom Adventurer has commenced its maiden voyage to Antarctica.
What a snob.
I've decided to stay awhile.
I might find others like Osono who will like me and accept me for what I am.
How much do you think it would cost to install a phone?
A phone?
Yeah.
For my business.
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Yes!
That smells good.
Can I help out?
Sure.
A delivery service, huh?
I have one skill, flying, so I thought about a delivery service.
Everyone will love it.
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.
And you can base the business out of your room upstairs.
Really?
Thank you.
I'd like to put a phone up there.
But a phone costs money.
I have some saved up already.
Don't waste it.
Why not use our phone?
It takes time to get regular customers.
If you help around the bakery, you won't have to pay rent or the phone bill.
I need the help since I'm expecting a baby.
I'll throw in free breakfast too.
Thank you!
I'll do my very best for you.
You're such a wonderful person!
Jiji, come on!
I'm all done!
It's time to go shopping.
Stop jumping out into the street.
We're not at home.
I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.
I've never been more embarrassed in my whole life.
It was so terrible!
Oh, please.
I wish I had something pretty to wear.
Boy, this is expensive.
Kiki, look!
Is there any money left?
We'll just have to eat pancakes for a while.
Wow!
Those are beautiful.
Wait!
Pull over a second!
Miss Witch!
Not flying today?
What'd I tell you?
Black is all she wears.
Wait!
Come back!
I'm sorry!
I was only kidding!
Perfect timing, Kiki.
A lady wants you to deliver something.
She's your first customer.
Customer?
I'll be right back!
The map!
This lady is a customer of ours.
We were talking about your delivery service.
You are a cute little witch.
My name's Kiki, ma'am.
Could you deliver this by tonight?
Yes!
It's my nephew's birthday.
But I can't get there myself to give him his present.
Where do you want it delivered?
That's me.
It won't be too far?
I can fly directly from here.
How much do you want?
I haven't set a price yet.
Is this enough?
This is more than enough.
Thank you, ma'am.
Up we go!
Oh, wow!
That's great!
I wish I could fly.
Yeah!
Hey, do you know that girl?
How high do you intend to go?
It's my first delivery.
I don't want to be stopped by that police officer.
I was afraid you were going to deliver it to the angels.
It's just beyond the cape.
Here we go!
I'm liking this town more and more.
I'm not sure what I think.
I'll finally be able to write to Mom.
Those are wild geese.
Wonderful!
They're flying along with us!
They seem awfully upset.
They say a wind's coming.
They also say they're going higher.
Oh, no!
I'm sorry.
I-- Ow!
Please!
I'm sorry!
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs!
I've never been so scared.
It's your fault.
They warned us of that wind, but you didn't listen.
You're right.
That's beautiful.
They were able to fly that high up with the wind.
Kiki!
The toy is gone!
Oh no!
Maybe it's when we fell?
Yeah!
They're saying: "The egg thief's coming again!" What are we gonna do?
Hey!
Stop that!
Don't do that!
Stop it!
We're in trouble.
They're still upset.
Witches get no respect these days.
Crows used to be witches' servants.
That was a long time ago, okay?
How about we go get it after dark?
We'll never make it in time.
There's only one way to do it.
They'll find out I'm a fake!
After I find it, I'll be right back to help you out.
Is that the place?
Yes.
Don't move a muscle.
Can I breathe?
Hold it as long as you can.
Yeah!
Give me my present!
That's pretty weird.
A bit late, aren't you?
After my sister rang, we wondered where you were.
I'm sorry.
Could you please sign here?
Mom, can I put the canary in here?
Okay, but be careful not to let it escape.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Come on, birdie!
I'm gonna put you in a bigger house!
Please hurry, Kiki.
I know it was here, so it must be around someplace.
There it is!
Excuse me!
Anybody home?
Can you please help me?
Anybody?
Anybody here?
Yeah!
I can't come down right now.
Why don't you come up?
What do you want?
That stuffed black cat you put on your window sill?
Sorry, but it's mine.
I dropped it.
Be good, and don't move yet.
I found it in the forest.
Would you give it back to me, please?
Hang on.
I can't stop just now.
Nice.
Very nice.
You're beautiful just how you are.
You really should have told me you were in a hurry.
I got sort of fond of it.
I'm sorry.
The stuffing is coming out.
I'll bet the crows did it.
They made such a fuss.
What will I do?
I can't deliver it like this.
Say!
How about we work out a deal?
That's pretty exciting.
And at 13 too.
To be independent.
That's great.
Can you fix it?
Trust me.
Ketto, time for your bath.
Quickly!
The guests will be here soon!
Ketto!
I'm done.
Thank you so much!
You'd better help Jiji before it's too late.
But I haven't finished yet.
You've done enough.
Go help him.
Thanks!
Jeff likes my present more than me!
It is strange.
He adores that stuffed cat.
He won't leave it alone.
He thinks it's a puppy.
Your sister's not going to be happy to hear that.
That's okay.
I gave it to Jeff anyway.
Remember to thank your auntie.
I will!
You should be nicer to him.
Jeff is a very old dog.
But, Grandma, all he does is sleep!
I suppose that's true.
Ketto, open the door for Jeff.
Okay.
Push the door shut when you're finished.
Jiji!
Kiki, what took you so long?
I'm sorry.
That marvelous dog helped me escape.
He said he'd be happy to help us out.
Would you take this back in?
What's the matter?
I'm famished.
Yeah, me too.
And I'm tired too.
But it was a wonderful adventure.
And that painter who found the stuffed cat wants to do a drawing with me in it.
Naked?
Don't be silly!
KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE Boring.
Hey!
Aren't you supposed to be minding the shop?
I am, but nobody's coming in today.
But it always gets busy around now.
I know, but I mean my customers.
Jiji, if nobody comes in, I'll have to eat pancakes forever and be fat, fat, fat!
So, what am I supposed to do?
I think pancakes are great, provided they're not burnt.
You're no help.
When you get fat, see if I care.
Beautiful, isn't she?
I heard she's a fashion designer.
Personally, I'm not very fond of her conceited cat.
Hello.
Gutiokipan Bakery.
Pardon?
Yes, ma'am.
About time we got a customer. 4:30 will be a perfect time to pick it up.
And the address?
Yes.
The blue roof.
Right.
Yes, I'm sure I have it all.
Thank you very much.
Hi.
I'll take this one.
Okay?
Thank you very much.
Are you still mad at me?
We're having a party at the club tonight.
It's called the Flying Club, and we'd really like you to come.
Here's your invitation.
It really is a serious club.
Everybody would be very happy if you came.
May I help you?
They tell me you have a delivery service.
Pardon me.
Yes, of course we do.
This urgent package must arrive tonight.
Can you do it?
Of course we can...
Will you be all right?
Can I help you?
I'll be back at 6:00, so make up your mind by then.
How much will that be?
Will that be inside or outside the city limits?
I wrote it down on the box.
The box?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Osono!
I got an invitation to a party at Tombo's flying club.
Terrific!
You'll have a lovely time.
But what am I gonna wear?
Kiki, I wouldn't worry too much.
You look fine in that.
You look beautiful and mysterious.
You mean it?
Any work yet?
I almost forgot about it!
It's already 4:00!
Oh, no!
Can you watch the store 'til I get back?
Jiji!
Why are you going to this party when you're so mad at him?
I have to concentrate.
This thing is heavy.
Be quiet.
Thank you.
Come on!
Our next appointment is at 4:30.
The blue roof.
My name's Kiki.
Someone telephoned for a delivery service, so here I am.
Right this way, dear.
You're right on time.
Yes, ma'am.
Madam, the delivery girl is here.
What?
Oh, my goodness!
Is it that time already?
Come, come.
Thanks.
May I take that for you?
Broom and a black cat.
It's just like my great-grandmother always told me.
My name is Kiki, and I'm a witch.
Oh, and what a cute little girl you are.
I'm so sorry, but that pie you were supposed to deliver isn't ready yet.
The temperature doesn't seem to go up at all.
Something's wrong.
Machines don't work when they become old like me.
I was hoping you could deliver it hot to my grandchild's birthday party.
It's one of my favorite recipes: herring and pumpkin pie.
I guess I have to admit defeat.
I'll have to call and tell her I'm sorry.
I feel just awful having you come here for nothing.
Bertha!
Would you get her money, please?
Certainly, ma'am.
All of it.
Pay her the amount we agreed on.
Oh, no.
Please!
Now, don't be silly.
It's not your fault it wasn't ready.
I have no other jobs today.
Maybe I could help.
Does that oven work?
You mean that one?
It used to be the only one I ever used, but I haven't opened it in years.
If it burns firewood, I can help.
I used to help my mom all the time.
It's a big job to build a fire.
It's a great idea, madam.
I never did like that electric thing, and we have plenty of firewood.
I can build a fire.
Well, I'm not sure, but if you think you can do it...
But won't this make you late for your party?
I can't take money for nothing.
Come on.
We must hurry.
Look what I found.
And it works!
You're very good at this, my dear.
Your mother taught you well.
Oh, my goodness, it's so exciting.
Never did like electricity.
It should be about time.
Yes, very good.
Well done.
And now we wait.
About 40 minutes or so.
Right?
Exactly right.
So why don't we take a little break?
Do you need help with anything else?
Oh!
Well, if you'd really like to...
Thanks very much.
You're very welcome.
You're going to be late for the party.
Stop worrying.
It'll only take me 15 minutes if I fly there fast.
Would you care for some tea?
I just made a pot.
I just remembered.
Won't you be late for your party?
It won't be a problem.
It'll take me 15 minutes from here.
But, my dear, that clock runs about ten minutes slow.
What'll I do?
See if the pie is ready.
Okay.
Bertha!
Is the pie ready?
It smells fine, so you'd better hurry.
Okay.
Better hurry!
Okay.
Don't forget your money.
That's way too much.
Not for what you've done.
Hurry up, Kiki, or you'll be late!
Have a good time!
Be careful!
What happened to all that good weather?
My whiskers are tingling.
Could we get out of the rain?
We can't!
That'll only make us later!
Besides, the pie will get cold.
Yes?
I have a delivery.
But it's completely wet.
I'm sorry.
It began to rain on the way.
But the food is all right.
I told Grandma I didn't want that.
Who is it?
Grandma sent another of her crummy herring pies!
Would you please sign this receipt for me?
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.
She can't possibly be her granddaughter.
Do you think we can still make it in time?
Look!
Tombo's down there!
We can still make it.
That was quite an ordeal.
That boy waited a very long time.
Doesn't matter anyway.
I can't go in wet clothes.
Kiki, what's wrong?
Do you have a headache?
Why don't we grab a bite to eat?
I know I'm famished.
Kiki!
Not feeling very well, huh?
You have quite a fever.
Is someone pounding on my head?
I'll bet you didn't dry yourself off completely yesterday.
Am I gonna shrivel up and die?
You have a cold, is all.
I'll bring up some medicine.
And you should eat something.
I'm not hungry.
It'll be better if you eat now.
How about some oatmeal?
Like some, Jiji?
Oatmeal is the best thing for a cold.
There you go.
Don't burn your tongue.
Come and eat your oatmeal before it gets cold.
Do I have to eat?
If you want to get well.
That boy was in the shop a while ago.
When I told him you were sick, he asked how a witch could catch a cold.
Oh, yes.
He said he wanted to visit you a little later.
Oh, no!
I figured you might say that, so I politely refused.
You're tired.
Just relax and sleep.
I'll open the window for some air.
Osono...
Hmm?
Never mind.
Jiji!
Jiji!
What?
Jiji!
Breakfast is ready!
Kiki?
Feeling better this morning?
Much better, thank you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I'd overslept.
That's okay.
Come down here later.
I have a favor to ask of you.
Okay. "Koppori." Is that right?
Yes.
Is this enough money?
Don't worry.
It's close enough to walk.
Don't be silly.
Work is work.
Be sure to deliver it to him directly.
Jiji!
You have work?
It's not far away.
Who's your friend?
Lily's her name.
I'll come down.
Don't worry.
I'll be back in a minute.
Pleasure to meet you, Lily.
Wonderful.
Hey!
Miss Witch!
Taking a walk?
I'm looking for someone named Koppori.
Hey, that's my name!
What?
Go around that way.
I'll be right with you.
I'll bet Osono planned this.
Gee, thanks a lot.
I want to apologize for making you wait the other night.
I'm sorry you got wet.
Want to come over to my place?
I have something to show you.
Come on!
Hurry!
The party was to celebrate the completion of this.
It's the engine of a human-propelled plane.
Like it?
We're assembling the wings and the frame at a friend's house.
I'm planning on flying this thing during my summer vacation.
Hey!
Let's go see where that dirigible landed! "Dirigible"?
You didn't see it on TV?
I was sleeping.
Then we have to go!
We're going with this?
Why not?
I have to practice anyway.
Gotta build up my legs.
Okay.
Ready?
I've never ridden a bicycle before.
Oh, boy!
Even better!
Brace the bike with your foot until I get her revved up.
Let's go!
Kick off!
Should I get off?
No!
Go faster!
Go!
That's great!
Hang in there!
Swing your body to the inside when we go around the bend.
Otherwise, it won't turn very well.
Now!
Great!
You're doing fine!
Yippee!
Great!
The dirigible, right?
Right.
We're flying!
Tombo, are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Does my face look that funny?
I'm sorry, but when we flew over that cliff, I was so scared!
I was scared too.
I'll bet you used some magic.
I'm not sure.
I was so frightened.
Your poor bike.
It's a mess.
Oh, no!
I'm in trouble!
Will you look after the bike for me?
What's wrong?
I pedaled too hard!
Wait there!
Sure would be terrific to go around the world in a dirigible like that.
How'd it make you feel, the first time you flew?
I can't recall.
I was too young to remember.
But my mom told me I wasn't scared a bit.
I wish I was born into a witch family.
You can just fly away on a broomstick, but...
This is all I can do.
I don't find flying that much fun.
It's more of a job to me.
But I think it's wonderful that you can put your talents to work.
I sort of feel my confidence slipping.
But I'm glad I came with you today.
I feel better sitting by the ocean.
I could bring you here anytime you want and train myself at the same time.
You're a very nice person.
You just found out?
I used to think you were a clown.
My mom says the same thing. "You clown!
Quit looking up to the sky and get back to your books!" Tombo!
Huh?
Hey!
Guess what!
What?
Something good!
Come here!
I'll be back.
Wait here.
They said we could go inside.
Coming?
They what?
Wow!
Of course!
Hey, who's your girlfriend?
That's Kiki the Witch.
Come on over, Kiki!
They're gonna show us around inside that dirigible!
No, thanks.
Ah, come on.
It'll be fun.
The delivery girl.
I'm positive that's her.
You mean she's a working girl?
My, how independent.
Come on.
I'll introduce you.
No, thanks.
See you later.
What's the matter?
Hey!
What are you so mad about?
I'm not mad at all.
I have a lot of work to do, so just leave me alone.
Tombo, let's go!
I think something's wrong with me.
I make friends, then suddenly, I can't bear to be with any of them.
That other me, the cheerful, honest me, went off somewhere.
Some friend you are.
Jiji, I don't care if you do have a girlfriend.
You can't be late for every meal.
And clean up after yourself.
What are you talking like a cat for?
Jiji.
Oh, no!
Talk to me!
Can't you speak anymore?
Jiji!
I wonder what happened.
I can't figure out a word he says anymore.
Oh, my gosh!
I'm losing my powers.
You can't fly anymore?
Have you lost your magic?
It has become very weak, so I think I should take a break from delivery work.
But I'll work really hard in the bakery, so please let me stay in my room.
Of course you can stay.
Will your powers come back?
I don't know.
Maybe.
I can make another broom, but...
Look!
Kiki!
It's me, Tombo.
Did you see me?
I was waving at you from the dirigible.
The captain took me on the test flight.
It was great!
Hello?
Kiki, are you there?
Please don't call me anymore.
What?
I can barely hear you.
The captain said he'd like to meet you.
Hey, come on!
Don't hang up!
What's wrong?
You don't look very well.
I'm still training to be a witch.
If I lose my magic, that means I've lost absolutely everything.
Kiki!
Hi!
You didn't come pay me a visit, so I had to come visit you.
I'm sorry.
Well, I also came to shop a little.
Come on in.
I'm done now.
We can take a break.
You'd better believe I will.
Nice place you have.
Help yourself to these.
I'll make some fresh tea.
No tea, thanks.
Do you have some milk?
Sure.
Positively amazing.
The spitting image of that stuffed cat.
You're Jiji, right?
How's the home delivery business?
That bad, huh?
I'm taking a break right now.
I see.
I thought you seemed down.
I didn't know that happened to witches.
Why not come and stay at my place?
Tell your boss you need a break.
They'll manage somehow.
How about it, Jiji?
Rather be with your girlfriend?
Come on!
Let's go!
Hurry!
It's leaving!
I'm bushed!
It's so beautiful.
Must've been blind, with two beautiful girls in front of him.
What do you mean, you thought I was a boy?
Well, look at the way you're dressed.
Tell me what kind of boy has these legs, mister.
Crows!
We've become real close friends.
Really?
Hello, everybody.
We're home again.
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry I bothered you before.
Make yourself at home while I get some water.
Like it?
Wonderful.
I got the idea for it after we met the first time.
But I really haven't got the girl's face right.
I've been waiting for you to come back.
You mean, that's me?
Yes.
Would you be my model?
But I'm not beautiful.
You've got a great face.
Besides, it's prettier than it was the last time.
Come on.
Have a seat.
Right there.
Lift up your head a little.
Look beyond the horizon.
Don't move.
Very good.
Painting and magic seem to be similar.
Sometimes, I can't paint a thing.
You mean it?
Then what happens?
Kiki, don't look over here.
Without even thinking about it, I used to be able to fly.
Now, I can't even begin to remember how I ever managed to do it.
At times like that, you know what I do?
Paint.
That gets rid of my frustrations.
But still, if I can't fly...
Then I just stop.
Take long walks, look at the view, doze off at noon.
Don't do anything.
Then, suddenly, I can paint again.
Maybe that'll help.
Trust me.
It'll happen.
Come on, don't ruin the pose.
When I was your age, I'd already decided to become an artist.
I loved painting.
So much that I couldn't sleep.
Then one day, for no reason, I couldn't paint.
I kept painting, but it was no good.
I realized that I was just imitating other painters.
Just copies of paintings I'd seen.
I swore I'd paint my own pictures.
That must've been hard.
But after that... it's not much easier now.
I think I found what painting means, at least for me.
To fly, you don't chant a spell or something, right?
We fly with our spirit.
A witch's spirit?
Perfect!
That's what I'm talking about.
A witch's spirit.
An artist's spirit.
A baker's spirit!
I suppose it must be a power given by God.
Sometimes, you suffer for it.
I guess I never gave witchcraft much thought.
That talk about discipline and training was so old-fashioned.
I was so happy that you came all that way to see me.
Left alone, I would've been one giant ball of frustration.
There have been many times I've thought of painting over that painting.
Why?
It's so beautiful.
When I saw you today, I saw your sad face and thought, "I've found it!" I knew I could paint you.
Not fair!
Sure it is.
Let's go to sleep.
Okay.
Sorry about taking your bed.
Don't worry about it.
Can I visit you once in a while?
Sure.
Anytime during the summer.
And I'll try to visit you too.
Okay.
The dirigible Freedom Adventurer, recently damaged in a forced landing due to torrential rains just outside the city limits, has now been repaired...
Hello.
Gutiokipan Bakery.
Ah, Kiki.
Take plenty of time and get rested up.
That elderly lady you helped has another job for you.
Should I tell her "no"?
I've told her you'd be away for some time, but she kept insisting.
Then stop on your way back.
Bye.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Well, well.
We've been expecting you.
Come in.
There are less than five minutes to takeoff now.
Very nice to see you again, ma'am.
I'm glad you came.
Excuse me for not standing, but my legs are bothering me more than usual.
Bertha, the package.
Yes!
I hope it hasn't taken off yet.
Not yet.
Bertha's absolutely mad about lighter-than-air travel.
I'm the adventuresome type.
Turn the volume down.
Kiki, would you open the box?
Yes.
What's this?
Would you please deliver it to a girl named Kiki?
She was kind and a tremendous help.
I want to say thank you.
And would you find out when her next birthday might be?
Then I'll be able to bake her another one.
Kiki.
I will.
And I'm sure Kiki will want to know the lady's birthday, so she'll be able to give her a present.
You've got a deal.
What happened?
There's been a terrible catastrophe.
Oh, no!
The ropes holding the blimp are breaking!
It's drifting straight toward our cameras.
My God, it's going to-- Oh!
They always leave me hanging at the most exciting part!
These winds always come in midsummer.
They'll be hitting us pretty soon.
It'll pass by quickly.
Don't worry.
Oh, goody, it's back on.
It's completely upside-down!
The Freedom Adventurer has been shaken by great winds...
It's like a balloon in that position.
It has broken loose from its mooring and drifted into an upside-down position.
A desperate, last-ditch effort is being made to tie the dirigible down and keep it from drifting away.
It's extremely doubtful whether it can be done.
Oh, no!
It's useless!
That's my friend Tombo holding on to that rope! ...attached to the end of the cable as though it were a toy!
There's a young boy hanging on to the cable!
He's being lifted away along with the police car! -I don't believe what I'm seeing!
Tombo!
Are you sure it's your friend?
I have to go!
Be careful!
Oh, dear.
What's happening?
Hold on there, son!
Just hold your grip steady!
Release the helium from the tail!
All citizens are requested to remain calm.
Do not panic.
The helium inside the dirigible will not explode.
Tombo.
Any word about the boy hanging on the rope?
The latest report was that the police car dropped into a pool!
The helium inside the dirigible will not explode.
Move aside!
Get on the sidewalk!
Don't block the street!
Are you feeling all right?
Please, sir, may I borrow your broom?
Huh?
I promise I'll bring it right back.
Well, I suppose so.
Thank you very much!
Fly.
Oh, my goodness!
Straighten up and fly right, or I'll burn you!
The boy appears safe, but the dirigible is heading straight for the clock tower.
If the wind doesn't shift direction, the Freedom Adventurer will surely smash into the tower!
We gotta get up higher!
We're gonna hit the tower!
There's not enough helium!
Before we hit, jump onto the tower!
Aye, aye, Captain!
Hey there!
Over here!
Come on!
Get out of the way!
Grab hold of this!
That way!
Hurry!
Don't you dare!
That sound is the helium gas leaking.
The condition of the boy is unknown.
From where I am-- Oh, no!
Too much gas has escaped, and it's falling!
It is snagged on another building!
Hey, look!
Over there!
It's a miracle!
The boy has managed to hold on!
But how can anyone rescue him now?
That boy is hanging on for dear life.
Something just flew by!
Is it a bird?
No, no, it's a girl!
A witch!
Yes, there is a young girl soaring through the sky!
Wow!
Go, Kiki!
She can fly now!
Get 'em!
Tombo!
Kiki!
Come on!
Be a good broom and help me out!
Hang on, young fella!
Don't give up!
Hold on!
She's almost there!
Tombo!
Kiki!
You can do it!
Hold on!
Don't give up now!
You can do it!
Don't give up, son.
Don't give up!
Don't give up!
She caught him in midair!
I've never seen anything so amazing!
They've landed safely.
What a sight to see!
Everyone onboard appears to be fine.
That broom is mine.
I gave it to her myself.
She did it!
You're so brave, Kiki.
You did a great job!
Better call the hospital.
I'll be ready any minute now.
Jiji!
We just got a letter from Kiki! "Dear Mother and Father, how are you doing?
Jiji and I are fine." Everything at work is falling into place.
I'm gaining confidence.
There are still times when I feel sad, but all in all, I sure love this town.
THE END
