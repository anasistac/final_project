Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.
Because of something that happened before I was even born.
See, a long time ago, there was this family.
The papá, he was a musician.
He and his family would sing and dance and count their blessings.
But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.
And one day, he left with his guitar and never returned.
And the mamá...
She didn't have time to cry over that walk-away musician.
After banishing all music from her life she found a way... to provide for her daughter.
She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes.
She could have made candy, or fireworks, or sparkly underwear... for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes.
Then she taught her daughter to make shoes.
And later, she taught her son-in-law.
Then her grandkids got roped in.
As her family grew, so did the business.
Music had torn her family apart.
But shoes held them all together.
You see, that woman was my great-great-grandmother, Mamá Imelda.
She died way before I was born.
But my family still tells her story every year on Día de los Muertos... the Day of the Dead.
And her little girl, she's my great-grandmother, Mamá Coco.
Hola, Mamá Coco.
How are you, Julio?
Actually, my name is Miguel.
Mamá Coco has trouble remembering things.
But it's good to talk to her anyway.
So, I tell her pretty much everything.
I used to run like this.
But now I run like this which is way faster.
And the winner is Luchadora Coco!
I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side.
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.
Miguel, eat your food.
My abuelita, she's Mamá Coco's daughter.
Oh, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.
No, gracias.
I asked if you would like more tamales!
Sí?
That's what I thought you said!
Abuelita runs our house just like Mamá Imelda did.
No music!
No music!
Y aunque la vida No music!
I think we're the only family in México who hates music.
And my family's fine with that.
But me...
Be back by lunch, mijo.
Love you, Mamá.
I am not like the rest of my family!
Hola, Miguel!
Hola!
Muchas gracias.
De nada, Miguel.
Hey!
Dante!
Sit.
Down.
Roll over.
Shake.
Fist bump!
Good boy, Dante!
I know I'm not supposed to love music.
But it's not my fault!
It's his!
Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.
Right here in this very plaza, Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps... toward becoming the most beloved singer in Méxican history.
He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.
But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him.
He starred in movies.
He had the coolest guitar!
He could fly!
And he wrote the best songs.
But my all-time favorite, it's...
Remember me Remember me Though I have to say goodbye Remember me Remember me Don't let it make you cry For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart Remember me Though I have to travel far Remember me Remember me Each time you hear a sad guitar Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be Until you're in my arms again He lived the kind of life you dream about.
Until 1942.
When he was crushed by a giant bell.
I want to be just like him.
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and I get this feeling like we're connected.
Like if he could play music, maybe someday, I could too.
If it wasn't for my family.
Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.
Huh?
I asked for a shoe shine not your life story.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
I just can't really talk about any of this at home.
So...
If I were you, I'd march right up to my family and say... "Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it." I could never say that.
You are a musician, no?
I don't know.
I mean, I only really play for myself.
Did de la Cruz become the world's best musician by hiding his skills?
No!
He walked out onto that plaza and he played out loud.
Mira, mira, they're setting up for tonight!
The music competition for Día de Muertos.
DÍA DE MUERTOS TALENT SHOW PLAZA SANTA CECILIA - 7PM You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!
Uh-uh.
My family would freak!
Look, if you're too scared then, well, have fun making shoes.
Come on, what did de la Cruz always say?
Seize your moment?
Show me what you got, muchacho.
I'll be your first audience.
Miguel!
Abuelita!
What are you doing here?
You leave my grandson alone.
Doña, please!
I was just getting a shine.
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?
He was just showing me his guitar.
Shame on you.
My grandson is a sweet little angelito querido cielito.
He wants no part of your music, mariachi.
You keep away from him.
Ay, pobrecito.
Oh, estás bien, mijo.
You know better than to be here in this place!
You will come home.
Now.
How many times have we told you?
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.
Yes, Tío Berto.
No, no, no, no, no!
Go away, you.
Go!
It's just Dante.
Never name a street dog.
They'll follow you forever.
Now, go get my shoe.
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.
Ay, Miguel!
You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza.
I was just shining shoes.
A musician's shoes!
But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is.
If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza.
But what about tonight?
What's tonight?
Well, they're having this talent show.
And I thought I might...
Sign up?
Well, maybe?
You have to have talent to be in a talent show.
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes?
It's Día de los Muertos.
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.
Ofrenda room.
Vámonos.
Don't give me that look.
Día de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us.
We've put their photos on the ofrenda so their spirits can cross over.
That is very important.
If we don't put them up, they can't come.
We made all this food, set out the things they loved in life, mijo.
All this work to bring the family together.
I don't want you sneaking off to who knows where.
Where are you going?
I thought we were done.
Ay, Dios mio.
Being part of this family means being here for this family.
I don't want to see you end up like-- Like Mamá Coco's papá?
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.
But you're the one who-- I was just-- But-- I-- Papá?
Papá is home?
Mamá, cálmese, cálmese.
Papá is coming home?
No, Mamá.
It's okay.
I'm here.
Who are you?
Rest, Mamá.
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel.
Miguel?
Miguel?
What are we going to do with that boy?
You're right.
That's just what he needs.
It's you.
Get in here.
Come on, Dante.
Hurry up!
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy.
Someone could hear me.
I wish someone wanted to hear me.
Other than you.
Ew.
Okay.
Perfecto!
Remember Me I have to sing.
I have to play!
The music, it's not just in me, it is me.
When life gets me down, I play my guitar.
The rest of the world may follow the rules, but I must follow my heart.
You know that feeling like there's a song in the air and... it's playing just for you?
A feeling so close...
You could reach out and touch it I never knew I could want something so much, but it's true You must have faith, sister.
Oh, but, Padre, he will never listen.
He will listen.
To music.
Only a song, only a song has the power to change a heart Never underestimate the power of music.
But my father, he will never give his permission.
I am done asking permission.
When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by.
You must seize it!
Señor de la Cruz, what did it take for you to seize your moment?
I had to have faith in my dream.
No one was going to hand it to me.
It was up to me to reach for that dream.
Grab it tight and make it come true. ...and make it come true.
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me.
Día de los Muertos has begun!
No, no.
We have to make a clear path.
The petals guide our ancestors home.
We don't want their spirits to get lost.
We want them to come and enjoy all the food and drinks on the ofrenda.
Mamá!
Where should we put this table?
In the courtyard, mijos.
You want it down by the kitchen?
Sí.
Next to the other one.
Get under!
Get under!
Miguel?
Nothing!
Mamá, Papá.
I-- Miguel, your abuelita had the most wonderful idea.
We've all decided.
It's time you joined us in the workshop!
What?
No more shining shoes.
You'll be making them every day after school.
Oh!
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on the family tradition.
And on Día de los Muertos!
Your ancestors will be so proud.
You'll craft huaraches just like your Tía Victoria.
And wingtips like your Papá Julio.
But what if I'm no good at making shoes?
Ah, Miguel.
You have your family here to guide you.
You are a Rivera.
And a Rivera is...
A shoemaker.
Through and through.
That's my boy!
Berto!
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.
Dante!
No, Dante.
Stop!
No, no, no, no, no!
No.
De la Cruz's guitar?
Papá?
Papá?
Mamá Coco, is your papá Ernesto de la Cruz?
Papá!
Papá!
Papá!
Papá!
It's him!
I know who my great-great-grandfather was.
Miguel, get down from there.
Mamá Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna be a musician!
What is all this?
You keep secrets from your own family?
It's all that time he spends in the plaza.
Fills his head with crazy fantasies.
It's not a fantasy.
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
The greatest musician of all time!
We've never known anything about this man!
But whoever he was, he still abandoned his family.
This is no future for my son.
But, Papá, you said my family would guide me.
Well, de la Cruz is my family.
I'm supposed to play music.
Never!
That man's music was a curse.
I will not allow it.
If you would just let-- Miguel...
You will listen to your family.
No more music.
Just listen to me play!
End of argument.
You want to end up like that man?
Forgotten?
Left off your family's ofrenda?
I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda.
No!
Mamá!
There.
No guitar.
No music.
Oh, come.
You'll feel better after you eat with your family.
I don't want to be in this family!
Miguel!
Miguel!
I want to play in the plaza, like de la Cruz.
Can I still sign up?
You got an instrument?
No.
But if I can borrow a guitar...
Musicians got to bring their own instruments.
You find a guitar, kid, I'll put you on the list.
Can I borrow your guitar?
Sorry, muchacho.
You guys have a spare guitar?
No.
I need a guitar just for a little bit.
Get out of here, kid.
Great-great-grandfather, what am I supposed to do? "SEIZE YOUR MOMENT!" Ernesto de la Cruz No, no, no, no.
Dante, stop!
Cállate!
Sh!
I'm sorry.
Señor de la Cruz, please don't be mad.
I'm Miguel.
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.
Our family thinks music is a curse.
None of them understand but I know you would have.
You would have told me to follow my heart.
To seize my moment!
So, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza.
Just like you did!
The guitar!
It's gone!
Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar!
The window's broken.
Look!
All right, who's in there?
I'm sorry.
It's not what it looks like.
De la Cruz is my-- There's nobody here.
Miguel!
Mamá!
Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?
Dios mio!
Little boy.
Are you okay?
Here.
Let me help you.
Thanks.
I-- Do you mind?
Whoa!
Look how big she's getting.
Dante!
You can see me?
Wait!
What's going on?
Dante!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Miguel?
Miguel?
Miguel?
You're here?
Here, here.
And you can see us?
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!
Remind me how I know you.
We're your family, mijo.
Tía Rosita?
Sí.
Papá Julio?
Hola.
Tía Victoria?
He doesn't seem entirely dead.
He's not quite alive either.
We need Mamá Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.
Oye!
It's Mamá Imelda.
She couldn't cross over.
She's stuck!
On the other side!
Tío Oscar?
Tío Felipe?
Oh.
Hey, Miguel.
I have a feeling this has something to do with you.
But if Mamá Imelda can't come to us...
Then we are going to her.
Vámonos!
Come on, Miguel.
It's okay.
Dante?
Dante!
Dante, wait up!
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.
You thought we weren't?
Well, I don't know.
I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids.
Like vitamins.
Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.
Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be.
Mija, it's not nice to stare at-- Ay!
Santa Maria!
Are those...
Alebrijes!
But those are-- Real alebrijes.
Spirit creatures.
They guide souls on their journey.
Watch your step.
They make caquitas everywhere.
Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.
Please have all offerings ready for re-entry.
RE-ENTRY Welcome back.
Anything to declare?
Some churros.
From my family.
How wonderful.
Next.
If you are experiencing travel issues, agents at the Department of Family...
Reunions are available to assist you.
DEPARTURES Next family, please.
Oh!
Your photos are on your son's ofrenda.
Have a great visit.
Gracias.
And remember to return before sunrise.
Enjoy your visit.
Next.
Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda.
Enjoy your visit.
Gracias.
Next?
Yes!
It is I.
Frida Kahlo.
Shall we skip the scanner?
I'm on so many ofrendas it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingy.
Well, shoot, looks like no one put up your photo, Frida.
Okay, when I said I was Frida, just now, that was a lie.
And I apologize for doing that.
No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing the bridge.
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.
Hey!
Almost...there.
Just a little further.
Upsy-daisy...
Fine.
Okay.
Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!
Aw.
I don't know what I'd do if no one put up my photo.
Next?
Oh!
Come, mijo.
It's our turn.
Welcome back, amigos.
Anything to declare?
As a matter of fact, yes.
Hola.
Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.
Please report to Level Seven.
I miss my nose.
DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS Come on, help us out, amigo.
We got to get to a dozen ofrendas tonight.
We are not visiting your ex-wife's family for Día de Muertos!
I demand to speak to the person in charge!
I'm sorry, señora, it says here no one put up your photo.
My family always puts my photo on the ofrenda.
That devil box tells you nothing but lies!
Mamá Imelda?
Oh, mi familia!
They wouldn't let me cross the bridge.
Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda.
Well, we never made it to the ofrenda.
What?
We ran into...
Miguel?
Mamá Imelda.
What is going on?
You the Rivera family?
Well, you're cursed.
What?
Día de los Muertos is the night to give to the dead.
You stole from the dead!
But I wasn't stealing the guitar.
Guitar?
It was my great-great-grandfather's.
He would have wanted me to have it.
We do not speak of that musician.
He is dead to this family.
You're all dead.
I am sorry.
Whose alebrije is that?
That's just Dante.
He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.
He just looks like a plain old dog.
Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop.
Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic.
But Dante doesn't have any hair.
And I don't have a nose, and yet, here we are.
But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over.
Oh!
You took my photo off the ofrenda?
It was an accident!
How do we send him back?
Well, since it's a family matter... the way to undo a family curse is to get your family's blessing.
That's it?
Get your family's blessing and everything should go back to normal.
But you got to do it by sunrise.
What happens at sunrise?
Híjole!
Your hand!
Whoa, Miguel, can't have you fainting on us.
But not to worry.
Your family's here.
You can get your blessing right now.
Cempasúchil, cempasúchil.
Aha!
Perdón, señora.
Now, you look at the living and say his name.
Miguel.
Nailed it.
Now say, "I give you my blessing." I give you my blessing.
I give you my blessing to go home... to put my photo back on the ofrenda, and to never play music again.
What?
She can't do that!
Well, technically, she can add any condition she wants.
Fine.
Then you hand the petal to Miguel.
No skeletons!
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.
Two seconds and you already break your promise.
This isn't fair.
It's my life.
You already had yours.
Papá Julio, I ask for your blessing.
Tía Rosita?
Oscar?
Felipe?
Tía Victoria?
Don't make this hard, mijo.
You go home my way or no way.
You really hate music that much?
I will not let you go down the same path he did.
The same path he did.
He's family.
Listen to your Mamá Imelda.
She's just looking out for you.
Be reasonable.
Con permiso, I need to visit the restroom.
Be right back.
Should we tell him there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead?
Vámonos.
We got a family looking for a living boy.
If I want to be a musician, I need a musician's blessing.
We got to find my great-great-grandpa.
Hold it, muchacho.
I found that living boy!
Oh, whoa, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.
Excuse me.
No, no.
Dante!
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer.
Falsifying a unibrow.
That's illegal?
Very illegal.
You need to clean up your act, amigo.
Amigo?
Oh, that's so nice to hear you say that because I have just had a... really hard Día de Muertos and I could really use an amigo right now.
And amigos, they help their amigos.
You get me across that bridge tonight, and I'll make it worth your while.
Oh!
You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.
I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular show.
I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.
You just got to let me cross that bridge!
I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday.
But my shift's almost up and I want to visit my living family.
So I'm letting you off with a warning.
Can I at least get my costume back?
No.
Some amigo.
Hey!
Hey!
You really know de la Cruz?
Who wants to-- Ay!
You're alive!
Sh!
Yeah, I'm alive.
And if I want to get back to the Land of the Living...
I need de la Cruz's blessing.
That's weirdly specific.
He's my great-great-grandfather.
He's your Gr-- What?
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Wait.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Wait!
Yes!
You're going back to the Land of the Living!
You know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good-- No, no, niño!
Niño, niño, I can help you.
You can help me.
We can help each other.
But most importantly, you can help me.
Miguel!
I'm Héctor.
That's nice.
Espérame, chamaco!
Ay, he is going to get himself killed.
I need my spirit guide...
Pepita.
Who has that petal Miguel touched?
Here.
Nice alebrije.
Ay, ay, hold still.
Look up.
A ver, a ver.
Look up, up, up.
Aqui arriba, eso...
Eh, la rayita.
Okay.
Hey!
Ta-da!
Dead as a doorknob.
So listen, Miguel, this place runs on memories.
When you're well remembered, people put up your photo and you get to... cross the bridge and visit the living on Día de Muertos.
Unless you're me.
You don't get to cross over?
No one's ever put up my picture.
But you can change that!
This is you?
Eh, muy guapo, eh?
So, you get me to my great-great-grandpa... then I put up your photo when I get home?
Such a smart boy!
Yes!
Great idea, yes!
One hiccup.
De la Cruz is a tough guy to get to and I need to cross the bridge soon.
Like, tonight.
So, you got any other family here, you know?
Someone a bit more accessible?
Mm...
Nope.
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.
You got to have some other family.
Only de la Cruz.
If you can't help me, I'll find him myself.
Oh!
Okay.
Okay, kid.
Fine!
Fine!
I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa.
It's not gonna be easy, you know?
He's a busy man.
What are you doing?
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.
No.
Skeletons don't walk like that.
It's how you walk.
No, I don't!
Stop it!
Whoa!
Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular?
Qué padre!
Every year your great-great-grandpa puts on that dumb show... to mark the end of Día de Muertos.
And you can get us in!
Hey, you said you have front row tickets!
That...was a lie.
I apologize for that.
Cool off, chamaco.
Come on.
I'll get you to him.
How?
Because I happen to know where he's rehearsing.
Remember me Don't let it make you cry You better have my dress, Héctor.
Hola, Ceci.
Hola.
Ceci, I lost the dress.
Ya lo sabía!
I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise.
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida short of an opening number!
Dante!
We shouldn't be in here.
No, no, Dante!
Ven acá!
You!
How did you get in here?
I just followed my-- Oh!
The mighty Xolo dog!
Guider of wandering spirits.
And whose spirit have you guided to me?
I don't think he's a spirit guide.
The alebrijes of this world can take many forms.
They are as mysterious as they are powerful.
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.
You are the audience.
Darkness.
And from the darkness, a giant papaya.
Dancers emerge from the papaya, and the dancers are all me.
And they go to drink from the milk of their mother, who is a cactus.
But who is also me.
And her milk is not milk but tears.
Is it too obvious?
I think it's just the right amount of obvious?
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...
Oh!
And then it could go...
And what if everything was on fire?
Yes!
Fire!
Everywhere!
Inspired!
You have the spirit of an artist.
The dancers exit.
The music fades, the lights go out.
And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!
Huh?
He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers-- Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!
He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower.
Chamaco, you can't run off on me like that.
Stop pestering the celebrities.
You said my great-great-grandpa would be here!
He's halfway across town throwing some big party.
That bum.
Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal?
If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you?
He's your great-great-grandpa, how come he didn't invite you?
Hey, Gustavo!
You know anything about this party?
It's the hot ticket!
But if you're not on the guest list, you're never getting in, Chorizo.
Hey!
It's Chorizo!
Choricito!
A-ha.
Very funny, guys.
Very funny.
Chorizo?
Oh, this guy's famous!
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.
I don't want to talk about it.
He choked on some chorizo!
I didn't choke, okay?
I got food poisoning which is a big difference.
This is why I don't like musicians.
Bunch of self-important jerks.
Hey!
I'm a musician!
You are?
If you really want to get to Ernesto, there is that music competition... at the Plaza de la Cruz.
Winner gets to play at his party.
No, no.
Chamaco, you're loco if you think-- I need to get my great-great-grandfather's blessing!
You know where I can get a guitar?
I know a guy.
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?
A footprint!
It's a Rivera boot.
Size seven!
And a half.
Pronated.
Miguel.
Why the heck would you want to be a musician?
My great-great-grandpa was a musician!
Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers.
No thank you.
No!
Guácala!
What do you know?
So, how far is this guitar anyway?
We're almost there.
Keep up, chamaco.
Come on.
Cousin Héctor!
Hey!
These guys!
Hey, Tío! ¿Qué onda?
These people are all your family?
In a way.
We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas.
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?
So, we all call each other cousin, or tío, or whatever.
Héctor!
Tía Chelo!
Muchas gracias!
Hey!
Save some for me!
Is Chicharrón around?
Eh, in the bungalow.
I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors.
Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Héctor?
Buenas noches, Chicharrón!
I don't want to see your stupid face, Héctor.
Come on.
It's Día de Muertos.
I brought you a little offering.
Get out of here.
I would, Cheech.
But the thing is, me and my friend, Miguel...
We really need to borrow your guitar.
My guitar?
Yes.
My prized beloved guitar?
I promise we'll bring it right back.
Like the time you promised to bring back my van?
Or my mini-fridge?
Ah, you see-- Or my good napkins?
My lasso?
My femur?
Well, no, not like those times.
Where is my femur?
You-- You okay, amigo?
I'm fading, Héctor.
I can feel it.
I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to.
You play me something.
No.
You know I don't play anymore, Cheech.
The guitar is for the kid.
You want it, you got to earn it.
Ay, only for you, amigo.
Any requests?
You know my favorite, Héctor.
Well, everyone knows Juanita Her eyes each a different color Her teeth stick out And her chin goes in And her...
Knuckles they drag on the floor Those aren't the words.
There are children present.
Her hair is like a briar She stands in a bow-legged stance And if I weren't so ugly She'd possibly give me a chance Brings back memories.
Gracias.
Wait.
What happened?
He's been forgotten.
When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you... you disappear from this world.
We call it the final death.
Where did he go?
No one knows.
But I've met him.
I could remember him when I go back!
No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco.
Our memories, they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life... in the stories they tell about us.
But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories.
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.
Come on, de la Cruzcito, you've got a contest to win.
You told me you hated musicians.
You never said you were one.
How do you think I knew your great-great-grandpa?
We used to play music together.
Taught him everything he knows.
No manches!
You played with Ernesto de la Cruz... the greatest musician of all time?
Ah, you're funny.
Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe.
But his music?
Eh, not so much.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!
Showtime, chamaco!
Llévelo!
T-shirts!
Bobbleheads!
Bienvenidos a todos!
Who's ready for some música?
It's a battle of the bands, amigos.
The winner gets to play for the maestro himself, Ernesto de la Cruz... at his fiesta tonight!
That's our ticket, muchacho.
Let the competition begin!
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?
Definitely Remember Me.
No!
Not that one.
No.
Come on.
It's his most popular song!
It's too popular.
Remember me Though I have to travel far Remember me...
Don't let it make you cry...
What about Poco Loco?
Epa!
Now that's a song!
De la Cruzcito?
You're on standby.
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.
Los Chachalacos!
You always this nervous before a performance?
I don't know.
I've never performed before.
What?
You said you were a musician!
I am!
I mean, I will be.
Ay!
Once I win.
That's your plan?
No.
You have to win.
Your life literally depends on... you winning.
And you've never done this before!
I'll go up there.
No!
I need to do this.
Why?
If I can't go out and play one song, how can I call myself a musician?
What does that matter?
Because I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing...
I need to prove that I'm worthy of it.
Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment at such a bad time!
Okay!
Okay.
You want to perform?
Then you got to perform!
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.
Now give me your best grito.
My best grito?
Come on, yell!
Belt it out.
Ah, it feels good.
Okay, now you.
Oh, come on, kid.
De la Cruzcito, you're on now!
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, look at me.
You can do this.
Grab their attention and don't let it go.
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.
De la Cruzcito!
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?
Bring back the singing dogs!
Qué bien!
Vámonos!
Whoo!
What color is the sky?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor You tell me that it's red Ay mi amor, ay mi amor Where should I put my shoes?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor You say put them on your head Ay mi amor, ay mi amor You make me un poco loco Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco The way you keep me guessing I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing I'll count it as a blessing That I'm only un poco loco No!
No!
No!
Not bad for a dead guy!
Not so bad yourself, gordito!
Eso!
He's close!
Find him!
The loco that you make me It is just un poco crazy The sense that you're not making The liberties you're taking Leaves my cabeza shaking You're just un poco loco We're looking for a living kid.
About twelve?
Have you seen a living boy?
Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-to loco Hey!
You did good!
I'm proud of you.
Eso!
Otra!
Otra!
Otra!
Hey!
Where are you going?
We got to get out of here!
What?
Are you crazy?
We're about to win this thing.
Damas y caballeros, I have an emergency announcement.
Please be on the lookout for a living boy.
Answers to the name of Miguel.
Earlier tonight he ran away from his family.
They just want to send him back to the Land of the Living.
Wait, wait.
You said de la Cruz was your only family.
The only person who could send you home.
I do have other family, but-- You could have taken my photo back this whole time?
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.
You lied to me!
You're one to talk.
Look at me.
I'm being forgotten, Miguel.
I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night.
I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge because... you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy.
It's not stupid!
I'm taking you to your family.
Let go of me!
You'll thank me later.
You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!
Keep your dumb photo.
Stay away from me!
No!
Hey, chamaco!
Where did you go?
Chamaco!
I'm sorry!
Come back!
Dante, cállate!
No!
Dante, stop it.
He can't help me.
Dante!
Stop!
Stop it!
Leave me alone!
You're not a spirit guide.
You're just a dumb dog!
Now get out of here!
It's him!
It's that living boy!
I heard about him.
Look!
He's alive!
He's alive.
The boy is alive!
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!
I am giving you my blessing and you are going home.
I don't want your blessing!
Miguel, stop!
Come back!
Miguel!
I am trying to save your life!
You're ruining my life!
What?
Music's the only thing that makes me happy.
And you want to take it away.
You'll never understand.
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona No dejaré de quererte...
I thought you hated music.
I loved it!
I remember that feeling... when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered.
But when we had Coco, suddenly there was something in my life that... mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down roots.
He wanted to play for the world.
We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted.
Now you must make a choice.
But I don't want to pick sides!
Why can't you be on my side?
That's what family's supposed to do.
Support you.
But you never will.
Have a good time.
Oh, how exciting!
Oh, El Santo.
I'm a big fan!
You mind if I...
Gracias, Señor.
Invitation?
It's okay.
I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson.
Disculpen, señores...
Hey, guys!
It's poco loco!
You were on fire tonight!
You too!
Hey, musician to musician...
I need a favor.
The competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.
Thanks, guys!
Hey!
Enjoy the party, little músico!
Gracias!
Oh!
Look!
It's Ernesto!
De la Cruz!
Señor de la Cruz!
Pardon me!
Señor de la Cruz!
Señor de la-- When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by.
You must seize it.
This one has a wise spirit.
We're almost there, Dante.
Señor de la Cruz!
Señor de la-- But what can we do?
It is hopeless...
You must have faith, sister.
But Padre, he will never listen.
He will listen... to music.
Señoras y señores, buenas tardes, buenas noches Buenas tardes, buenas noches Señoritas y señores To be here with you tonight Brings me joy!
Qué alegría For this music is my language And the world es mi familia For this music is my language And the world es mi familia For this music is my language And the world es mi familia For this music is my lang-- Are you all right, niño?
It's you!
You are that boy!
The one who came from the Land of the Living.
You...know about me?
You are all anyone has been talking about.
Why have you come here?
I'm Miguel.
Your great-great-grandson.
I... have a great-great-grandson?
I need your blessing so I can go back home and be a musician.
Just like you.
The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen.
But I hoped you would.
My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen?
I have a great-great-grandson!
Look!
It's Frida!
Yes, it is I.
Frida Kahlo.
It is an honor, Señora.
Gracias.
Hey, Negrete!
Infante!
Have you met my great-great-grandson?
My great-great-grandson.
He's alive!
And a musician to boot!
Dimple.
No dimple.
Dimple.
No dimple.
No dimple!
To our friendship.
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.
Salud!
Poison!
You know, I did all my own stunts.
Though I have to say goodbye Remember me...
All of this came from my amazing fans in the Land of the Living.
They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with!
Hey, what's wrong?
Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.
No!
It's all great!
But?
It's just-- I have been looking up to you my whole life.
You're the guy who actually did it!
But did you ever regret it?
Choosing music over everything else?
It was hard.
Saying goodbye to my hometown.
Heading off on my own...
Leaving your family?
Sí.
But I could not have done it differently.
One cannot deny who one is meant to be.
And you, my great-great-grandson, are meant to be a musician!
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.
We cannot belong to one family.
The world is our family.
The fireworks have begun!
Soon the party will move across town for my Sunrise Spectacular.
Miguel, you must come to the show!
You will be my guest of honor!
You mean it?
Of course, my boy.
I can't.
I have to get home before sunrise.
Oh!
I really do need to get you home.
It has been an honor.
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.
I hope you die very soon.
You know what I mean.
Miguel, I give you my bless-- We had a deal, chamaco.
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?
Frida!
I thought you couldn't make it.
You said you'd take back my photo.
You promised, Miguel.
You know this man?
I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.
Héctor?
Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.
My friend, you're being forgotten.
And whose fault is that?
Héctor, please...
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.
What?
If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them!
That's crazy!
De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.
You want to tell him or should I?
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.
We made a great team, but you died... and I only sang your songs because I wanted to keep a part of you alive.
How generous!
You really did play together.
I don't want to fight about it.
I just want you to make it right.
Miguel can put my photo up, and I can cross over the bridge.
I can see my girl.
Ernesto, remember the night I left?
That was a long time ago.
We drank together and you told me you would move Heaven and Earth... for your amigo.
Well, I'm asking you to now.
Heaven and Earth?
Like in the movie?
What?
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.
In the de la Cruz movie, El Camino a Casa.
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
No!
It's in there.
Look!
Never were truer words spoken.
This calls for a toast.
To our friendship!
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.
Salud!
Poison!
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...
We'd been performing on the road for months.
I got homesick... and I packed up my songs.
You want to give up now when we're this close to reaching our dream?
This was your dream.
You'll manage.
I can't do this without your songs, Héctor.
I'm going home, Ernesto.
Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up.
I could never hate you.
If you must go, then I'm sending you off with a toast.
To our friendship.
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.
Salud!
You walked me to the train station.
But I felt a pain in my stomach.
I thought it must have been something I ate.
Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend.
Or something I drank.
I woke up dead.
You poisoned me.
You're confusing movies with reality, Héctor.
All this time, I thought it was just bad luck.
I never thought that you might have-- That you...
How could you?
Héctor!
Security!
Security!
You took everything away from me!
You rat!
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.
I just wanted to go back home.
No!
No!
I apologize.
Where were we?
You were going to give me your blessing.
Yes.
Sí.
Miguel, my reputation...
It is very important to me.
I would hate to have you think...
That you murdered Héctor for his songs?
You don't think that.
Do you?
I-- No.
Everyone knows you're the good guy.
Papá Ernesto, my blessing?
Security?
Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.
What?
But I'm your family!
And Héctor was my best friend.
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel.
You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to seize your moment.
I know you understand.
No!
No!
Let go!
No!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
I want to go home.
Héctor?
Kid?
Héctor!
You were right.
I should have gone back to my family.
They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen.
I told them I didn't care if they remembered me.
I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda.
Hey, chamaco.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I told them I didn't care.
Héctor!
Héctor?
She's forgetting me.
Who?
My daughter.
She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge.
I just wanted to see her again.
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.
I wish I could apologize.
I wish I could tell her that her papá was trying to come home.
That he loved her so much.
My Coco...
Coco?
Where did you get this?
That's my Mamá Coco.
That's my Mamá Imelda.
Is that you?
We're... family?
I always hoped I'd see her again.
That she'd miss me.
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.
You know the worst part?
Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world...
I thought at least one day I'd see her here.
Give her the biggest hug.
But she's the last person who remembers me.
The moment she's gone from the living world...
You disappear... from this one.
You'll never get to see her.
Ever again.
You know, I wrote her a song once.
We used to sing it every night at the same time.
No matter how far apart we were.
What I wouldn't give to sing it to her one... last... time.
Remember me Though I have to say goodbye Remember me Don't let it make you cry For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart Remember me Papá!
Though I have to travel far Remember me Each time you hear a sad guitar Know that I'm with you The only way that I can be Until you're in my arms again Remember me He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.
You should be the one the world remembers, not de la Cruz!
I didn't write Remember Me for the world.
I wrote it for Coco.
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great-grandpa.
Are you kidding?
A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer.
You're a total upgrade.
My whole life, there's been something... that made me different.
And I never knew where it came from.
But now I know.
It comes from you.
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!
I'm proud to be his family!
Dante?
Dante!
It's Dante!
Imelda!
Héctor.
You look good.
Dante!
You knew he was my Papá Héctor the whole time!
You are a real spirit guide.
Who's the good spirit guide?
You are!
Dante!
There they are!
Miguel!
Miguelito!
Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.
Gracias, Dios mío.
Qué bueno.
Mijo, I was so worried!
Thank goodness we found you in time.
And you...
How many times must I turn you away?
Imelda.
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!
I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes.
He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!
I wasn't in there because of Héctor.
He was in there because of me.
He was just trying to get me home!
I didn't want to listen, but he was right.
Nothing's more important than family.
I'm ready to accept your blessing.
And your conditions.
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.
To get Héctor's photo.
What?
So he can see Coco again.
Héctor should be on our ofrenda.
He's part of our family.
He left this family!
He tried to go home to you and Coco.
But de la Cruz murdered him!
It's true, Imelda.
And so what if it's true?
You leave me alone with a child to raise... and I'm just supposed to forgive you?
Imelda, I-- Héctor!
I'm running out of time.
It's Coco.
She's forgetting you.
You don't have to forgive him.
But we shouldn't forget him.
I wanted to forget you.
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...
This is my fault.
Not yours.
I'm sorry, Imelda.
Miguel, if we help you get his photo, you will return home?
No more music?
Family comes first.
I can't forgive you.
But I will help you.
So, how do we get to de la Cruz?
I might know a way.
Sunrise Spectacular!
Good luck, muchacho.
Gracias, Frida.
Here, let me help you with-- Don't touch me!
Everyone clear on the plan?
Find Héctor's photo.
Give it to Miguel.
Send Miguel home.
Got your petals?
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.
Yes?
Don't I know you?
That's for murdering the love of my life!
Who-- Who the-- She's talking about me!
I'm the love of your life?
I don't know.
I'm still angry at you.
Héctor!
How did you-- And that's for trying to murder my grandson.
Grandson?
She's talking about me!
You!
Wait.
You're related to Héctor?
The photo!
After him!
Security!
Ayúdenme!
You said love of your life.
I don't know what I said.
That's what I heard.
Places, Señor.
You're on in thirty seconds.
Ay!
Miguel!
I have it!
Hurry!
Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen... the one... the only...
Ernesto de la Cruz!
Get her off the stage.
Sing!
Sing!
Ay, de mi Llorona Llorona de azul celeste Ay, de mi Llorona Llorona de azul celeste Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona No dejaré de quererte No dejaré de quererte Me subí al pino más alto, Llorona A ver si te divisaba Como el pino era tierno, Llorona Al verme llorar, lloraba Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona Llorona de azul celeste Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona Llorona de azul celeste Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona No dejaré de quererte Let go of me!
Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona No dejaré de quererte No dejaré de quererte No dejaré de quererte Ay, ay, ay I forgot what that felt like.
You still got it.
Miguel, I give you my blessing.
To go home, to put up our photos and to never-- Never play music again.
To never forget how much your family loves you.
You're going home.
You're not going anywhere.
Imelda!
Stay back!
Stay back!
All of you, stay back.
Not one more step.
Dante!
Ernesto, stop!
Leave the boy alone.
I've worked too hard, Héctor.
Too hard to let him destroy everything.
He's a living child, Ernesto.
He's a threat!
You think I'd let him go back to the Land of the Living with your photo?
To keep your memory alive?
No.
You're a coward!
I am Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time!
Héctor's the real musician.
You're just the guy who murdered him and stole his songs!
Murdered?
I am the one who's willing to do what it takes to seize my moment.
Whatever it takes.
No!
Miguel!
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.
Please, please, mi familia.
Murderer!
Orchestra.
A-one, a-two, a-one-- Remember me Though I have to s-- Hey!
Look!
Nice kitty.
Put me down!
No, please!
I beg of you!
Stop!
Stop!
No!
No!
No!
What did I miss?
Good boy, Dante!
Miguel!
Héctor!
The photo...
I lost it!
It's okay, mijo.
It's o-- Héctor!
Héctor?
Coco.
No!
We can still find the photo.
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.
No, no.
I can't leave you.
I promised I'd put your photo up.
I promised you'd see Coco.
We're both out of time, mijo.
Oh no!
No!
She can't forget you!
I just wanted her to know that I loved her.
Héctor!
You have our blessing, Miguel.
No conditions.
No!
Papá Héctor, please!
No!
Go home.
I promise I won't let Coco forget you!
There he is!
Miguel!
Stop!
Where have you been?
I need to see Mamá Coco, please.
What are you doing with that-- Give it to me!
Miguel, stop!
Miguel!
Miguel!
Mamá Coco?
Can you hear me?
It's Miguel.
I saw your papá.
Remember?
Papá?
Please!
If you forget him, he'll be gone.
Forever.
Miguel, open this door!
Here.
This was his guitar, right?
He used to play it to you?
See?
There he is!
Papá!
Remember?
Papá?
Miguel!
Mamá Coco, please!
Don't forget him.
What are you doing to that poor woman?
It's okay, Mamita.
It's okay.
What's gotten into you?
I thought I'd lost you, Miguel.
I'm sorry, Papá.
We're all together now.
That's what matters.
Not all of us.
It's okay, Mamita.
Miguel, you apologize to your Mamá Coco.
Mamá Coco?
Well?
Apologize!
Mamá Coco?
Your papá, he wanted you to have this.
Mamá, wait!
Remember me Though I have to say goodbye Remember me Don't let it make you cry For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you Each night we are apart Remember me Though I have to travel far Remember me Each time you hear a sad guitar Know that I'm with you The only way that I can be Until you're in my arms again Remember me Elena?
What's wrong, mija?
Nothing, Mamá.
Nothing at all.
My papá used to sing me that song.
He loved you, Mamá Coco.
Your papá loved you so much.
I kept his letters.
Poems he wrote me.
And...
Papá was a musician.
When I was a little girl... he and Mamá would sing such beautiful songs.
ONE YEAR LATER Remember Me And right over here, one of Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures.
The home of the esteemed song writer, Héctor Rivera.
The letters Héctor wrote home for his daughter, Coco, contain the lyrics... for all of your favorite songs.
Not just Remember Me.
And that man is your Papá Julio.
And there's Tía Rosita and your Tía Victoria.
And those two are Oscar and Felipe.
These aren't just old pictures, they're our family... and they're counting on us to remember them.
Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool Enjoy your visit, Héctor.
But last night it seemed that I dreamed about you Papá!
Coco!
When I opened my mouth what came out was a song And you know every word and we all sang along To a melody played on the strings of our souls And a rhythm that rattled us down to the bone Our love for each other will live on forever In every beat of my proud corazón Our love for each other will live on forever In every beat of my proud corazón Ay mi familia Oiga mi gente Canten a coro Let it be known Our love for each other will live on forever In every beat of my proud corazón Ay mi familia Oiga mi gente Canten a coro Let it be known Our love for each other will live on forever In every beat of my proud corazón
In sixteen hundred seven We sailed the open sea For glory, God and gold and the Virginia Company For the New World is like heaven And we'll all be rich and free Or so we have been told by the Virginia Company So we have been told by the Virginia Company For glory, God and gold and the Virginia Company Ready to hoist the cannon? - Right!
Hey, look.
Is that Smith?
That's him, all right.
The old sea dog.
Captain John Smith.
I've heard some amazing stories about him.
Are you coming on this voyage too?
Of course he is, you half-wit.
You can't fight Indians without John Smith.
That's right.
I'm not about to let you boys have all the fun.
On the beaches of Virginny There's diamonds like debris There silver rivers flow and gold you pick right off a tree With a nugget for my Winnie And another one for me And all the rest will go to the Virginia Company To glory, God and gold And the Virginia Company ...
Haul on the brace!
Come on, come on!
Do your best!
Watch out!
Faster!
She's taking on more water!
Look out!
John!
Get down here!
The cannons are breaking loose!
Reef the topsails! - Yes, sir!
Steady on your course.
It's all right, Thomas.
We'll get her tied off.
Say your prayers, men!
Thomas, watch it!
Help!
Man overboard!
Help!
Stay your course!
He's lost!
Help!
Pull the pins!
Aye, sir!
Smith!
Smith!
Are you crazy?
Hang on, Thomas!
I've got you!
Quick!
The rope!
Heave!
Come on, lads!
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
Put your back into it! - Pull!
Pull! - Hang on! ...
There, my lucky lads.
Well, that was refreshing.
Well done, Smith.
Of course, you'd all do the same for me.
Oh, sure, sure. -Of course we would.
Sure, yes.
Yeah, we would.
Absolutely!
Trouble on deck?
Governor Ratcliffe.
Thomas fell overboard, sir. - Thank heavens he's been successfully retrieved.
Well done, Smith.
Thank you, sir.
Don't lose heart, men.
It won't be long before we reach the New World.
And remember what awaits us there.
Freedom, prosperity... the adventure of our lives.
You're the finest crew England has to offer, and nothing not wind nor rain nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages shall stand in our way.
Carry on, men!
A stirring oration, sir.
I'm sure the men were most exhilarated.
Let us hope so I'll need those witless peasants to dig up my gold, won't I?
This New World's gonna be great, John.
I'm gonna get a pile of gold, build me a big house... and if any Indian tries to stop me, I'll blast him.
You just worry about that fortune of yours, Thomas.
Leave the savages to me.
You think they'll give us much trouble?
Not as much trouble as Smith'll give them.
We'll kill ourselves an Injun Or maybe two or three We're stalwart men and bold of the Virginia Company What do you suppose the New World will look like?
Like all the others, I suppose.
I've seen hundreds of new worlds, Thomas.
What could possibly be different about this one?
It's glory, God and gold And the Virginia Company Steady as the beating drum Singing to the cedar flute Seasons go and seasons come Bring the corn and bear the fruit By the waters sweet and clean Where the mighty sturgeon lives Plant the squash and reap the bean All the Earth our mother gives Oh, great spirit, hear our song Help us keep the ancient ways Keep the sacred fire strong Walk in balance all our days Seasons go and seasons come steady as the beating drum Plum to seed to bud to plum Steady as the beating drum ...
It's good to be home.
The Massawomecks are defeated!
With the help of our brothers, our villages are safe again.
Your return has brought much joy to the village.
Look at all the smiling faces.
Yes, but there's one smiling face I don't see.
Where is my daughter?
You know Pocahontas.
She has her mother's spirit.
She goes wherever the wind takes her. ...
Pocahontas!
Your father's back!
Come down here!
He's back, Flit.
Come on, Meeko! ...
No!
Not that way. ...
Show-off. ...
Uh-oh! ...
Pocahontas?
Pocahontas!
Are you all right?
Well, you better be all right because I'm not coming in after you!
Don't you think we're getting a-- a little old for these games? ...
Help me turn this thing over.
What were you doing up there?
Thinking.
Meeko!
About the dream again?
Have you figured it out yet?
I know it means something...
I just don't know what.
You should ask your father about it.
Maybe I should.
Come on, Flit.
Quit playing around.
We have to get back. ...faced a determined enemy.
The battle lasted from the rising of the sun until the evening shadows fell.
Our warriors fought with courage, but none as bravely as Kocoum... for he attacked with the fierce strength of the bear.
He has proven himself to be the greatest of warriors...
Oh. he is so handsome. and the finest among us...
Hmph.
I especially love his smile. destroying every enemy in his path.
Tonight we will feast in his honour.
My daughter.
Wing-gap-o, Father.
Seeing you gives me great joy.
I'm so glad you've come home safely.
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.
I want to hear everything you've been doing.
Father, for many nights now I've been having a very strange dream.
I think it's telling me something's about to happen.
Something exciting.
Yes, something exciting is about to happen.
Really?
What is it?
Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.
Marry Kocoum?
I told him it would make my heart soar.
But he's so serious.
My daughter, Kocoum will make a fine husband.
He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house with sturdy walls.
With him, you will be safe from harm.
Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path.
This is the right path for you.
But why can't I choose-- Pocahontas, come with me.
You are the daughter of the chief.
It is time to take your place among our people.
Even the wild mountain stream... must someday join the big river.
As the river cuts his path Though the river's proud and strong He will choose the smoothest course That's why rivers live so long.
They're steady As the steady beating drum Your mother wore this for our wedding.
It was her dream to see you wear it at your own.
It suits you.
He wants me to be steady like the river.
But it's not steady at all.
What I love most about rivers is you can't step in the same river twice The water's always changing always flowing But people, I guess can't live like that We all must pay a price To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing What's around the river bend Waiting just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free Don't know what for What I dream the day might send just around the river bend For me Coming for me I feel it there beyond those trees or right behind these waterfalls Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome, sturdy walls And never dreams that something might be coming just around the river bend just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend Beyond the shore Somewhere past the sea Don't know what for Why do all my dreams extend just around the river bend just around the river bend Should I choose the smoothest course Steady as the beating drum Should I marry Kocoum Is all my dreaming at an end Or do you still Wait for me Dream giver just around the river Bend ...
Is that my Pocahontas?
Grandmother Willow, I need to talk to you.
Good morning, child.
I was hoping you'd visit today.
Oh!
Why, your mother's necklace!
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.
Kocoum?
But he's so serious.
I know.
My father thinks it's the right path for me.
But lately, I've been having this dream and I think it's-- Oh, a dream!
Let's hear all about it.
Quiet!
Quiet! ...
Now, child, you were saying.
Well, I'm running through the woods... and then, right there in front of me, is an arrow.
As I look at it, it starts to spin.
A spinning arrow.
How unusual.
Yes.
It spins faster and faster and faster until suddenly it stops. ...
Hmm.
Well, it seems to me... this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path.
But, Grandmother Willow, what is my path?
How am I ever going to find it?
Your mother asked me the very same question.
She did?
What did you tell her?
I told her to listen.
All around you are spirits, child.
They live in the earth, the water, the sky.
If you listen, they will guide you.
I hear the wind.
Yes.
What is it telling you?
I don't understand.
You will understand Listen with your heart You will understand Let it break upon you Like a wave upon the sand It's saying something's coming.
Strange clouds?
Listen with your heart You will understand ...
What do you see?
Clouds.
Strange clouds.
Look at it, Wiggins.
An entire new world chock full of gold... just waiting for me.
And scores of adventures waiting for us.
Right, Percy?
Do you think we'll meet some savages?
If we do, we shall be sure... to give them a proper English greeting.
Ooh, gift baskets.
Oh, no.
And he came so highly recommended.
It's perfect, Governor.
The water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore.
Hey there, Percy.
Very well then.
Give the order.
Already done, sir.
I've got a crew assembled and they're ready to go.
About the natives I'm counting on you... to make sure those filthy heathens don't disrupt our mission.
Well, if they're anything like the savages I've fought before, it's nothing I can't handle.
Right.
That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.
See you, Percy.
The men like Smith, don't they?
I've never been a popular man I like you.
And don't think I don't know what those back stabbers at court say about me.
Oh, yes, all that talk about being a pathetic social climber who's failed at everything he's tried I'm very well aware that this is my last chance for glory.
But mark my words, Wiggins.
When King James sees the gold these peasants unearth... success will be mine at last.
Wake up!
Shake a leg!
Top off the yardarm!
It's incredible!
And it's all ours.
I've never seen anything like it.
It could look like Ratcliffe's knickers, for all I care... just as long as I get off this stinkin' boat.
Come on, men.
We didn't come all this way just to look at it. ...
Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut.
Steady!
Steady!
Hold up!
That's far enough.
All right, now.
Tie her off.
Here, John, tie off this end.
John?
John?
What are you doing up there?
Getting a better look.
Hey!
Well.
You're a strange-looking fellow.
Are you hungry?
Here you go.
Ah, it's a biscuit.
It's food.
Well, sort of.
You like it, eh?
Well, try eating it for four months straight.
You got a friend back there?
Hey!
Wh-- What?
Watch out.
What?
Get-- No. get-- Uh, look out.
John, you better get down here.
The governor's coming ashore.
All right.
All right.
I'm leaving.
Did you see their skin?
They have hair on their faces like dogs.
My brothers, we must know more about these visitors.
Kekata, what do you see?
These are not men like us... but strange beasts with bodies that shine like the sun... and weapons that spout fire and thunder.
They prowl the Earth like ravenous wolves... consuming everything in their path.
Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors to the river and attack.
We will destroy these invaders the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.
Kocoum, in that battle we knew how to fight our enemy.
But these pale visitors are strange to us.
Take some men to the river to observe them.
Let us hope they do not intend to stay.
I hereby claim this land and all its riches... in the name of His Majesty King James the First... and do so name this settlement Jamestown.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir.
Hurry now, Percy.
We must be all squeaky clean for the New World.
Captain Smith, it appears I've selected the perfect location, eh?
Not a savage in sight.
Just because we don't see them doesn't mean they're not out there, sir.
Well, then perhaps you should venture forth and determine their whereabouts, hmm?
If there are any Indians out there, I'll find them.
Now, gentlemen, to work.
You men, get the ship unloaded -Right, sir You men, build the fort.
The rest of you, break out the shovels.
It's time to start digging.
Digging?
Why, of course.
Let's not forget what the Spanish found when they came to the New World.
Gold!
Mountains of it.
Why, for years they've been ravaging the New World... of its most precious resources... but now... it's our turn.
The gold of Cortez The jewels of Pizarro Will seem like mere trinkets by this time tomorrow The gold we find here will dwarf them by far Oh, with all you got in ya, boys Dig up Virginia, boys Mine, boys Mine every mountain And dig, boys Dig 'til you drop Grab a pick, boys Quick, boys Shove in a shovel.
Uncover those loverly pebbles that sparkle and shine It's gold and it's mine Mine, mine Dig and dig and diggety dig And dig and dig and diggety dig Hei, nonny, nonny Hei, nonny, nonny Ooh, how I love it.
Hei, nonny, nonny Hei, nonny, nonny Riches for cheap.
Hei, nonny, nonny Ho, nonny, nonny There'll be heaps of it.
And I'll be on top of the heap Diggety, diggety, dig My rivals back home It's not that I'm bitter But think how they'll squirm when they see how I glitter The ladies at court will be all a-twitter The king will reward me He'll knight me...
No!
Lord me It's mine, mine Mine for the taking It's mine, boys Mine me that gold With those nuggets dug It's glory they'll gimme My dear friend King Jimmy will probably build me a shrine When all of the gold Is mined Dig and dig and diggety dig And dig and dig and diggety dig All of my life I have searched for a land like this one A wilder, more challenging country I couldn't design Hundreds of dangers await and I don't plan to miss one In a land I can claim A land I can tame The greatest adventure is mine Keep on working, lads Mine Don't be shirking, lads Mine, boys, mine - Find a mother lode Then mine another load Mine me that gold Dig, dig and diggety Beautiful gold Dig, dig for that gold Make this island my land Make the mounds big, boys I'd help you to dig, boys But I've got this crick in me spine This land we behold This beauty untold A man can be bold It all can be sold So go for the gold The gold Is -All the riches here Mine From this minute this land Mine -And what's in it Is mine And dig and dig and diggety dig Hey, nonny, nonny It's mine ...
No!
Wait.
Please.
Please!
Don't run off.
It's all right.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Here.
Let me help you out of there.
You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you?
It's all right. ...
Listen with your heart You will understand Let it break upon you Like a wave upon the sand Who are you?
Listen with your heart You will understand Pocahontas.
What?
What did you say?
My name is Pocahontas.
I'm John Smith.
That's it.
Keep at it, men.
Keep digging.
It's got to be here somewhere.
There's 30 more of them down by the ridge.
That makes more than a hundred.
Anything yet?
Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.
Um, how long are we going to keep digging like this, sir? - Aye.
We're slaving away, busting our backs day and night... for-- For king and country, I know, I know.
And I share your fatigue.
Mmm, Wiggins?
Wiggins?
Coming!
Dispose of this.
Who's a good doggy, hmm?
Who's a good doggy?
Fetch, boy!
Savages!
It's an ambush!
Arm yourselves!
Run!
Arm yourselves!
Make sure every man has a musket.
Shoot!
Them, you idiot! ...
Where's that blasted Smith when I need him?
Namontack! ...
Back to the village.
Shut up.
Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back.
Everyone, back to camp.
Get the rest of the cannons ashore and finish building the fort!
Aye, Governor.
And you.
Learn to use that thing properly.
A man's not a man unless he knows how to shoot.
These beasts invade our shores, and now this.
This wound is strange to me.
We will fight this enemy, but we cannot do it alone.
Kocoum, send messengers to every village in our nation.
We will call on our brothers to help us fight.
These white men are dangerous.
No one is to go near them.
It's called a helmet.
Helmet.
So, uh, what river is this?
Qui-yough-co-hannock.
You have the most unusual names here.
Pocahontas.
You have the most unusual name too.
John Smith.
Hey!
Is this bottomless pit a friend of yours?
Meeko!
Well, how do you do, Meeko?
It's all right.
It's just a handshake.
Here, let me show you.
Nothing's happening.
Uh, no, no.
I need your hand first.
It's how we say hello.
This is how we say hello.
And how we say goodbye.
I like hello better.
Yeah.
I remember you.
Flit just doesn't like strangers.
Well, I'm not a stranger any more.
Hmm.
Stubborn little fellow, isn't he?
Very stubborn.
Hey!
Meeko, come back here.
Don't worry.
He can't hurt it.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Get-- Meeko, bring that back!
N-No, it's all right.
He can keep it.
Call it a gift.
What was that?
My compass.
Compass? - It tells you how to find your way when you get lost.
But it's all right, I'll get another one in London.
London.
Is that your village?
Yes.
It's a very big village.
What's it like?
Well, it's got streets filled with carriages, bridges over the rivers... and buildings as tall as trees.
I'd like to see those things.
You will.
How?
We're going to build them here.
We'll show your people how to use this land properly, how to make the most of it.
Make the most of it?
Yes.
We'll build roads and decent houses and-- Our houses are fine.
You think that only because you don't know any better.
W-Wait a minute.
Don't take it tha-- Hey.
Hey!
Wait!
Wa-Wait!
There's so much we can teach you.
We've improved the lives of savages all over the world. - Savages?
Uh, not that you're a savage.
Just my people. - No.
Listen.
That's not what I meant.
Let me explain Let go!
No.
I'm not letting you leave.
Look, don't do this.
Savage is just a word, uh, you know.
A term for people who are uncivilized.
Like me.
Well, when I say uncivilized. what I mean is, is-- What you mean is "not like you".
You think I'm an ignorant savage And you've been so many places I guess it must be so But still I cannot see If the savage one is me How can there be so much that you don't know You don't know You think you own whatever land you land on The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim But I know every rock and tree and creature Has a life, has a spirit Has a name You think the only people who are people Are the people who look and think like you But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger You'll learn things you never knew you never knew Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain Can you paint with all the colours of the wind Can you paint with all the colours Of the wind Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest Come taste the sun sweet berries of the Earth Come roll in all the riches all around you And for once never wonder what they're worth The rainstorm and the river are my brothers The heron and the otter are my friends And we are all connected to each other In a circle In a hoop that never ends How high does the sycamore grow If you cut it down then you'll never know And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon For whether we are white or copper-skinned We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain We need to paint with all the colours of the wind You can own the Earth and still All you'll own is earth until You can paint With all the colours Of the wind What is it?
The drums.
They mean trouble.
I shouldn't be here.
I want to see you again.
I can't.
Please, don't leave.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
All right!
This one's ready to hoist!
Two on each side.
Ready now.
Push!
Watch it.
It's slippery -Come on, lads It's only a little picket fence.
Steady.
Steady.
There you go.
That'll keep everything out, eh,John?
Something wrong, John?
What?
You've been awfully quiet the last few days.
Oh, he's just mad that he missed all the action.
Ah, don't worry,John.
You'll get your chance to deal with the Indians.
Yeah, we'll take care of them like we did last time, eh, mates?
We shot ourselves an Injun or maybe two or three All right, you howling nutter, get to work!
Come on, Ben.
It's just a little fun.
Oh, sure, we're having loads of fun, right?
Look at us.
No gold, no food.
While Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day, happy as a clam.
I am doomed!
I should be wallowing in riches by now and I haven't found as much as a speck!
Think.
Think!
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Where could it be?
I've mined the forests and the hills and the swamps.
And nothing!
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?
I-- I-- I made it myself.
Take that silly-- Of course!
The Indians.
Wiggins, why do you think those insolent heathens attacked us?
Because we invaded their land and cut down their trees and dug up their earth?
It's the gold!
They have it and they don't want us to take it from them.
Well, I'll just have to take it by force then, won't I?
You there!
Where's Captain Smith?
Well, he's gone.
Aye.
Your singing must have scared them off.
Well, then go get him for heaven's sake!
What if we run into the Indians?
That's what guns are for.
Now arm yourselves and get moving!
Pocahontas.
You should be inside the village.
We'll be all right. - We're gathering food for when the warriors arrive.
Don't go far.
Now is not the time to be running off.- Yes, Father.
When I see you wear that necklace... you look just like your mother.
I miss her.
But she is still with us.
Whenever the wind moves through the trees, I feel her presence.
Our people looked to her for wisdom and strength.
Someday they will look to you as well.
I would be honoured by that.
You shouldn't be out here alone.
I'll send for Kocoum.
All right.
What is it?
What?
You're hiding something.
I'm not hiding anything.
Pocahontas, you can tell me.
I promise I won't tell anyone.
Pocahontas, look!
It's one of them!
I'm going to get-- What are you doing here?
I had to see you again.
Huh?
Pocahontas.
Pocahontas?
Please, don't say anything.
Quick, this way. - But-- Nakoma. - Huh?
Where is Pocahontas?
I-- I haven't seen her.
Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.
Tell her that.
She listens to you.
Huh.
Sure she does.
This place is incredible.
And to think we came all this way just to dig it up for gold.
Gold?
Hey, Meeko.
What's gold?
You know, it's, uh-- it's, it's yellow.
It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.
Oh!
Here, we have lots of it.
Gold.
No.
Gold is this.
Hmm.
There's nothing like that around here.
No gold.
Not that I've seen.
All this way for nothing.
Well, those boys are in for a big surprise.
Will they leave?
Some of them might.
Will you go home? - Well, it's not like I have much of a home to go back to.
I've never really belonged anywhere.
You could belong here.
What was that?
Did you see something?
No.
No.
I just, uh-- I-- I didn't see anything, did I?
Look again.
Let it break upon you Like a wave upon the sand Hello, John Smith.
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.
Then you should talk back.
Don't be frightened, young man.
My bark is worse than my bite.
Say something.
What do you say to a tree?
Anything you want.
So. uh-- Come closer, John Smith.
He has a good soul.
And he's handsome too.
Oh, I like her.
I knew you would.
Smith!
Smith!
Where are you, mate?
We can't let them see us.
Quick!
Over here.
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.
Aye.
Well, if you spot one, don't ask questions.
Just shoot.
Watch your feet, you big oaf!
It wasn't me.
It was the tree.
Oh, of course!
The tree just felt like lifting its roots and-- Let's get out of here.
Run!
But what about Smith?
He's a big lad.
He can take care of himself.
I'm glad you're on our side.
There's still some snap in these old vines.
I'd better get back before they send the whole camp out after me.
When will I see you again?
Meet me tonight.
Right here.
Well, I haven't had this much excitement in 200 years.
What am I doing?
I shouldn't be seeing him again.
I mean, I want to see him again.
Who wouldn't?
I want to see him again.
But still, something inside is telling me it's the right thing.
Perhaps it's your dream.
My dream?
Do you think he's the one the spinning arrow was pointing to?
Hmm. ...
The warriors are here!
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?
There you are.- Kocoum.
Look at them.
Now we have enough warriors to destroy those white demons.
Now that we are joined by our brothers... we will defeat this enemy.
Father, I need to speak with you.
Not now, my daughter.
The council is gathering.
We don't have to fight them!
There must be a better way.
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.
But maybe we should try talking to them.
They do not want to talk.
But if one of them did want to talk, you would listen to him, wouldn't you?
Pocahontas Wouldn't you?
Of course I would.
But it is not that simple.
Nothing is simple any more.
Easy, Thomas.
It's me.
Oh, John.
I could've killed you.
Not aiming like that, you couldn't.
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.
You'll see twice as well.
Smith, there you are!
We were looking all over for you.
Smith!
Where have you been?
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.
Excellent.
Then you must know the Indians' whereabouts.
We'll need that information for the battle.
What battle?
We will eliminate these savages once and for all.
No!
You can't do that.
Oh, can't I?
Look, we don't have to fight them.
John, what's gotten into you?
I met one of them.
You what?
A savage?
They're not savages.
They can help us.
They know the land.
They know how to navigate the rivers.
And look.
It's food.
What is it?
It's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure. - I like gruel.
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!
They want to kill us, all of us!
They've got our gold, and they'll do anything to keep it!
But there is no gold.
No gold?
And I suppose your little Indian friend told you this?
Yes.
Lies!
Lies!
All of it!
Murderous thieves!
There's no room for their kind in civilized society.
But this is their land!
This is my land!
I make the laws here.
And I say anyone who so much as looks at an Indian... without killing him on sight will be tried for treason... and hanged! ...
Pocahontas!
Nakoma!
Don't go out there.
I lied for you once.
Don't ask me to do it again.
I have to do this.
He's one of them.
You don't know him.
If you go out there, you'll be turning your back on your own people.
I'm trying to help my people.
Pocahontas, please.
You're my best friend.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I won't.
I know what I'm doing.
Pocahontas, no !
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us halfway around the world for nothin'.
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been lying to us since we left London.
Listen to you, ya bunch of idiots.
Those savages didn't attack us for nothin'.
They're hidin' somethin'.
If they do have the gold, I reckon we'll have to fight 'em.
Not me.
Either too hot or too cool.
I haven't been comfortable since we got here.
Oh, I know.
I've been itching a lot.
Follow him.
Yes, Governor.
I want to know where he's sneaking off to.
Yes, sir.
And if you happen to see any Indians, shoot them.
Oh, and Thomas, you've been a slipshod sailor and a poor excuse for a soldier.
Don't disappoint me again.
Kocoum.
What is it?
It's Pocahontas.
What's wrong?
Is she all right?
I think she's in trouble.
The Earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?
The warriors are here!
Pocahontas!
John.
Listen to me.
My men are planning to attack your people.
You've got to warn them.
Maybe it's not too late to stop this.
You have to come with me and talk to my father.
Pocahontas, talking isn't going to do any good.
I already tried talking to my men, but everything about this land has them spooked.
That's the strangest creature I've ever seen.
Percy.
Easy, Percy.
Come here!
Meeko, come back!
You see what I mean?
Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them.
Come-- Come here, both of you!
It's all right!
It's all right!
He's a friend!
Bad!
Bad dog!
Sit!
What are you doing?
Meeko!
Percy, get back here!
What are you doing?
Stop that!
All right, that's enough!
It's enough to make your sap boil.
Now then, there's something I want to show you.
Look.
The ripples.
What about them?
So small at first, then look how they grow.
But someone has to start them.
They're not going to listen to us.
Young man, sometimes the right path is not the easiest one.
Don't you see?
Only when the fighting stops can you be together.
All right.
Let's go talk to your father.
No!
Kocoum!
No!
Kocoum!
Leave him alone!
Kocoum!
Stop!
Both eyes open.
Thomas!
Is he-- You killed him.
I thought that-- Get away from him!
Pocahontas, it won't help!
He was only-- He killed him!
Thomas, get out of here!
Get out of here!
Who did this?
Pocahontas was out in the woods.
Kocoum went to find her and this white man attacked him.
Your weapons are strong, but now our anger is stronger.
At sunrise he will be the first to die.
But, Father-- I told you to stay in the village.
You disobeyed me.
You have shamed your father!
I was only trying to help.
Because of your foolishness, Kocoum is dead!
Take him away!
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.
Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you.
I was worried about you.
I-I thought I was doing the right thing.
All this happened because of me.
And now I'll never see John Smith again.
Come with me.
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes of the man who killed Kocoum.
Be quick.
Pocahontas.
I'm so sorry.
For what, this?
I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this.
Can't think of any right now, but-- It would've been better if we'd never met.
None of this would've happened.
Pocahontas, look at me.
I'd rather die tomorrow... than live a hundred years without knowing you.
Pocahontas.
I can't leave you.
You never will.
No matter what happens to me, I'll always be with you.
Forever.
Help!
Somebody help!
Help!
Help!
Easy, lad.
What is it?
It's Smith!
They got him!
Who got him?
The savages!
Savages?
They captured him, dragged him off!
Where'd they take him?
They headed north.
How many were there?
I don't know.
At least a dozen.
Filthy beasts!
Ratcliffe was right!
It's perfect, Wiggins.
I couldn't have planned this better myself.
The gold is as good as mine.
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us!
Thomas is right!
We've got to do somethin'!
And so we shall.
I told you those savages couldn't be trusted.
That's right!
Smith tried to befriend them, and look what they've done to him!
Yeah, that's right.- But now I say it's time to rescue our courageous comrade.
At daybreak, we attack!
What can you expect from filthy little heathens Here's what you get when races are diverse That's right.
Their skins are hellish red They're only good when dead They're vermin, as I said and worse They're savages, savages Barely even human Savages, savages Drive them from our shore They're not like you and me which means they must be evil We must sound the drums of war They're savages, savages Dirty shrieking devils Now we sound the drums of war This is what we feared The paleface is a demon The only thing they feel at all is greed Beneath that milky hide there's emptiness inside I wonder if they even bleed They're savages, savages Barely even human Savages, savages Killers at the core They're different from us which means they can't be trusted We must sound the drums of war They're savages, savages First we deal with this one Then we sound the drums of war Savages, savages Let's go get a few. men!
Savages, savages Now it's up to you, men Savages - Savages Barely even human Now we sound the drums Of War They're going to kill him at sunrise, Grandmother Willow.
You have to stop them.
I can't.
Child, remember your dream.
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow, I followed the wrong path.
I feel so lost.
The compass?
Spinning arrow.
It's the arrow from your dream.
I was right!
It was pointing to him.
Sunrise.
It's not too late, child.
Let the spirits of the Earth guide you.
You know your path, child.
Now follow it!
This will be the day Let's go, men!
This will be the morning Bring out the prisoner!
We will see them dying in the dust I don't know what I can do Still, I know I've got to try Now we make 'em pay Eagle, help my feet to fly Now, without a warning Mountain, help my heart be great Now we leave 'em blood and bone and rust Spirits of the Earth and sky It's them or us Please don't let it be too late They'rejust a bunch of Filthy, stinking savages Savages Demon - Devil Kill them!
Savages, savages What are we waiting for Destroy their evil race until there's not a trace left How loud We will sound the drums of war Are the drums of war Now we sound the drums of war Now we see what comes of trying to be chums Now we sound the drums Is the death of all I love carried in the drumming of Of War No!
If you kill him, you'll have to kill me too.
Daughter, stand back.
I won't!
I love him, Father.
What?
Look around you.
This is where the path of hatred has brought us.
This is the path I choose, Father.
What will yours be?
My daughter speaks with a wisdom beyond her years.
We have all come here with anger in our hearts... but she comes with courage and understanding.
From this day forward., if there is to be more killing... it will not start with me.
Release him.
Now's our chance!
Fire!
No!
What?
They let him go.
They don't want to fight.
It's a trick!
Don't you see?
Fire!
Fine.
I'll settle this myself.
No!
John!
You shot him! - He stepped right-- right into it.
It's his own fault.
Smith was right all along.
We never should've listened to you.
Get the gun!
Traitors!
Unhand me, I say!
How dare you!
Put him in chains!
I'll see you all hanged for this!
And gag him as well!
Is he gonna make it, Thomas?
The sooner he gets back to England, the better.
Well, let's hope the wind is with him.
Is the ship ready yet?
Any minute now.
Just loadin' the last bit of cargo.
How dare you!
Untie me at once!
I'll have your heads for this!
And he came so highly recommended.
The ship's almost ready.
We'd better get you on board.
We'll lose the tide.
No, not yet.
She said she'd be here.
Look.
Going back is his only chance.
He'll die if he stays here.
Here.
It's from Grandmother Willow's bark.
It'll help with the pain.
What pain?
I've had worse pain than this.
Can't think of any right now, but-- You are always welcome among our people.
Thank you, my brother.
I thought you didn't like strangers.
My mother's necklace.
See ya, Percy.
Come with me?
You must choose your own path.
I'm needed here.
Then I'll stay with you.
No.
You have to go back.
But I can't leave you.
You never will.
No matter what happens, I'll always be with you.
Forever.
Good luck, lad.
Godspeed, John.
The crew a-ready?
Aye, sir!
Set the mainsails!
Weigh anchor!
Let go of the topgallants!
Aye, sir!
If I never knew you If I never felt this love I would have no inkling of How precious life can be And I'm so grateful to you I'd have lived my whole life through Lost forever If I never knew you If I never knew you I'd be safe but half as real Never knowing I could feel A love so strong and true Oh, if I never knew you There's no moment I'd regret If I never knew your love Since the moment that we met I would have no inkling of If our time has gone too fast How precious life can be I've lived at last Yeah, yeah I thought our love would be so beautiful So beautiful Somehow we'd make the whole world bright I thought our love would be so beautiful We'd turn the darkness into light And still my heart is saying we were right We were right And if I never knew you If I never knew you I'd have lived my whole life through Empty as the sky Never knowing why Lost forever If I never knew You Yeah You think you own whatever land you land on The earth is just a dead thing you can claim But I know every rock and tree and creature Has a life, has a spirit Has a name You think the only people who are people Are the people who look and think like you But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger You'll learn things you never knew you never knew Have you ever heard the wolf cry To the blue corn moon Or let the eagle tell you where he's been Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain Can you paint with all the colours of the wind Can you paint with all the colours of the wind How high does the sycamore grow If you cut it down Then you'll never know And you'll never hear the wolf cry To the blue corn moon For whether we are white or copper-skinned We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain We need to paint with all the colours of the wind You can own the Earth and still All you'll own is earth until You can paint with all the colours Of The wind
In the beginning... there was only ocean... until the mother island emerged.
Te Fiti.
Her heart held the greatest power ever known.
It could create life itself.
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.
But in time... some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.
They believed if they could possess it... the great power of creation would be theirs.
And one day... the most daring of them all... voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.
He was a warrior.
A trickster.
A shapeshifter who could change form... with the power of his magical fish hook.
And his name... was Maui.
But without her heart, Te Fiti began to crumble... giving birth to a terrible darkness.
Maui tried to escape... but was confronted by another who sought the heart.
Te Kā!
A demon of earth and fire.
Maui was struck from the sky... never to be seen again.
And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te Fiti... were lost to the sea.
Where, even now... 1,000 years later...
Te Kā and the demons of the deep... still hunt for the heart.
Hiding in a darkness that will continue to spread... chasing away our fish... draining the life from island after island... until every one of us is devoured... by the bloodthirsty jaws... of inescapable death!
But one day... the heart will be found... by someone who will journey beyond our reef... find Maui... deliver him across the great ocean... to restore Te Fiti's heart... and save us all.
Thank you, Mother.
That's enough.
Papa.
No one goes outside the reef.
We are safe here.
There is no darkness.
There are no monsters.
Monsters!
There's no monsters, no monsters...
It's the darkness!
No, there is nothing beyond our reef, but storms and rough seas.
I'm gonna throw up.
As long as we stay on our very safe island... ...we'll be fine.
The legends are true.
Someone will have to go.
Mother, Motunui is paradise.
Who would want to go anywhere else?
Shoo, shoo!
Moana!
There you are, Moana.
What are you doing?
You scared me.
What?
I wanna's go back.
I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.
It's dangerous.
Moana, come on.
Let's go back to the village.
You are the next great chief of our people.
And you will do wondrous things, my little minnow.
Oh, yes.
But first, you must learn where you're meant to be.
Moana Make way, make way Moana, it's time you knew The village of Motunui is all you need The dancers are practicing They dance to an ancient song Who needs a new song This old one's all we need This tradition is our mission And Moana, there's so much to do Don't trip on the taro root That's all you need We share everything we make We joke and we weave our baskets The fishermen come back from the sea I wanna see Don't walk away Moana, stay on the ground now Our people will need a chief And there you are There you are There comes a day When you're gonna look around And realize happiness is Where you are Consider the coconut The what Consider its tree We use each part of the coconut It's all we need We make our nets from the fibers The water is sweet inside We use the leaves to build fires We cook up the meat inside Consider the coconuts The trunks and the leaves The island gives us what we need And no one leaves That's right, we stay We're safe and we're well-provided And when we look to the future There you are You'll be okay In time you'll learn just as I did You must find happiness right where you are I like to dance with the water The undertow and the waves The water is mischievous Ha!
I like how it misbehaves The village may think I'm crazy Or say that I drift too far But once you know what you like Well, there you are You are your father's daughter Stubbornness and pride Mind what he says but remember You may hear a voice inside And if the voice starts to whisper To follow the farthest star Moana, that voice inside is who you are Dad!
I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on 'em.
Come on.
There's something I need to show you.
I've wanted to bring you here from the moment you opened your eyes.
This is a sacred place.
A place of chiefs.
There will come a time... when you will stand on this peak and place a stone on this mountain.
Like I did.
Like my father did.
And his father, and every chief that has ever been.
And on that day... when you add your stone... you will raise this whole island higher.
You are the future of our people, Moana.
And they are not out there.
They are right here.
It's time to be who they need you to be.
We make our nets from the fibers We weave our nets from the fibers The water is sweet inside A real tasty treat inside We use the leaves to build fires We sing these songs in our choirs To cook up the meat inside We have mouths to feed inside The village believes in us That's right The village believes The island gives us what we need And no one leaves So here I'll stay My home, my people beside me And when I think of tomorrow There we are I'll lead the way I'll have my people to guide me We'll build our future together Where we are 'Cause every path leads ya back to Where you are You can find happiness right Where you are Where you are And every storm, this roof leaks, no matter how many fronds I add.
Fixed!
Not the fronds.
Wind shifted the post.
That's good pork!
I didn't mean...
I wasn't...
What?
They're calling me, so I gotta...
Bye!
You're doing great.
Is it done yet?
So close.
I'm curious about that chicken eating the rock.
He seems to lack the basic intelligence required for pretty much everything.
Should we maybe just cook him?
Sometimes our strengths lie beneath the surface.
Far beneath in some cases.
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei than meets the eye.
It's the harvest.
This morning, I was husking the coconuts and...
Well... we should clear the diseased trees and we will start a new grove.
There.
Thanks, Moana.
She's doing great.
This suits you.
Chief?
There's something you need to see.
Our traps in the east lagoon... they're pulling up less and less fish.
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.
We have.
There's no fish.
Oh.
Then we'll fish the far side of the island.
We tried.
The windward side.
And the leeward side, the shallows, the channel.
We've tried the whole lagoon.
They're just gone.
Have you tried using a different bait?
I don't think it's the bait.
There's no fish.
It seems like it's getting worse and worse.
Of course, I understand you have reason for concern.
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...
What if we fish beyond the reef?
No one goes beyond the reef.
I know.
But if there are no fish in the lagoon...
Moana.
And there's a whole ocean.
We have one rule.
An old rule, when there were fish.
A rule that keeps us safe...
But Dad, I... ...instead of endangering our people so you can run right back to the water.
Every time I think you're past this...
No one goes beyond the reef!
Well, it's not like you said it in front of your dad.
Standing on a boat.
I didn't say go beyond the reef, because I want to be on the ocean.
But you still do.
He's hard on you because...
Because he doesn't get me.
Because he was you.
Drawn to the ocean.
Down by the shore.
He took a canoe, Moana.
He crossed the reef... and found an unforgiving sea.
Waves like mountains.
His best friend begged to be on that boat.
Your dad couldn't save him.
He's hoping he can save you.
Sometimes... who we wish we were, what we wish we could do... it's just not meant to be.
I've been staring at the edge of the water Long as I can remember Never really knowing why I wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water No matter how hard I try Every turn I take Every trail I track Every path I make Every road leads back To the place I know Where I cannot go Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows How far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea Stays behind me One day I'll know If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island Seems so happy on this island Everything is by design I know everybody on this island Has a role on this island So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride I can make us strong I'll be satisfied If I play along But the voice inside Sings a different song What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea It's blinding But no one knows How deep it goes And it seems like it's calling out to me So come find me And let me know What's beyond that line Will I cross that line The line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows How far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know How far I'll go Whoa.
We're okay, Pua.
I can do this.
There's more fish beyond the reef.
There's more beyond the reef.
Not so bad.
Pua!
Whatever just happened... blame it on the pig.
Gramma.
Are you gonna tell Dad?
I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.
He was right.
About going out there.
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.
Okay.
Well, then, head on back.
Put that stone up there.
Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it?
You said that's what you wanted.
It is.
When I die...
I'm going to come back as one of these.
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.
Why are you acting weird?
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.
If there's something you want to tell me, just tell me!
Is there something you wanna tell me?
Is there something you want to hear?
You've been told all our people's stories... but one.
What is this place?
Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef?
What's in there?
The answer to the question you keep asking yourself.
Who are you meant to be?
Go inside... bang the drum... and find out.
Whoa.
Oh.
Bang the drum.
We read the wind and the sky When the sun is high We sail the length of the seas On the ocean breeze At night we name every star We know where we are We know who we are Who we are We set a course to find A brand new island everywhere we roam We keep our island in our mind And when it's time to find home We know the way We are explorers reading every sign We tell the stories of our elders In a never-ending chain We know the way We were voyagers.
We were voyagers!
We were voyagers!
We were voyagers!
We were voyagers!
Why'd we stop?
Maui.
When he stole from the mother island, darkness fell.
Te Kā awoke.
Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back.
To protect our people, the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging... and now we have forgotten who we are.
And the darkness has continued to spread... chasing away our fish... draining the life... from island after island.
Our island.
But, one day... someone will journey beyond our reef, find Maui... deliver him across the great ocean... to restore the heart of Te Fiti.
I was there that day.
The ocean chose you.
I thought it was a dream.
Nope!
Our ancestors believed Maui lies there... at the bottom of his hook.
Follow it, and you will find him.
But why would it choose me?
I don't even know how to make it past the reef.
But I know who does!
The crops are turning black.
What about the fish?
This is happening all over the island.
Please, please settle down.
What are you going to do?
We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...
We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!
There's a cavern of boats.
Huge canoes.
We can take them, find Maui, make him restore the heart.
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!
You told me to help our people.
This is how we help our people.
Dad?
What are you doing?
I should've burned those boats a long time ago!
No!
Don't!
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!
There is no heart!
This is just a rock!
No!
Chief!
It's your mother!
Mother...
What can be done?
Go.
Gramma.
Go.
Not now.
I can't.
You must!
The ocean chose you.
Follow the fish hook.
Gramma...
And when you find Maui... you grab him by the ear.
You say... "I am Moana of Motunui. "You will board my boat... "sail across the sea... "and restore the heart of Te Fiti." I can't leave you.
There is nowhere you could go that I won't be with you.
Go!
There's a line where the sky meets the sea And it calls me But no one knows How far it goes All that time wondering where I need to be is behind me I'm on my own To worlds unknown Every turn I take Every trail I track Is a choice I make Now I can't turn back from the great unknown Where I go alone Where I long to be See her light up the night in the sea She calls me And yes, I know That I can go There's a moon in the sky And the wind is behind me Soon I'll know How far I'll go I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat... sail across the sea and restore the heart of Te Fiti.
I am Moana... of Motu... ...nui.
Heihei?
It's okay.
You're all right.
See?
There we go.
Nice water.
The ocean is a friend of mine.
Heihei?
Heihei!
Stay.
Okay.
Next stop, Maui.
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat... sail... across the sea... and restore the heart of Te Fiti.
I am Moana of Motu...
Board my boat!
Oh, no.
No, no, no!
Ocean... can I get a little help?
No, no.
Please.
Come on!
Help me!
Please!
What?
I said help me!
And wrecking my boat?
Not helping!
Fish pee in you all day!
So...
Maui?
Maui!
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat.
No.
You will board my boat.
Yeah.
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my...
Boat!
A boat!
The gods have given me a...
Maui, shapeshifter... demigod of the wind and sea...
I am Moana of...
Hero of men.
What?
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea... hero of men.
I interrupted.
From the top.
Hero of men.
Go.
I am...
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
And women.
Men and women.
Both.
All.
Not a guy, girl thing.
You know, Maui is a hero to all.
You're doing great.
What?
No!
I'm here to...
Of course.
Yes, yes, yes.
Maui always has time for his fans.
When you use a bird to write with... it's called tweeting.
I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.
You are not my hero.
And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!
I'm here 'cause you stole the heart of Te Fiti!
And you will board my boat... and sail across the sea and put it back!
Yeah, it almost sounded like you don't like me... which is impossible because...
I got stuck here for 1,000 years... trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals.
So you could have the power to create life itself.
Yeah.
So, what I believe you were trying to say... is "thank you." "Thank you?" You're welcome.
What?
No, no, no!
I didn't...
I wasn't...
Why would I ever say that?
Okay, okay.
I see what's happening Yeah You're face to face with greatness and it's strange You don't even know how you feel It's adorable Well it's nice to see that humans never change Open your eyes Let's begin Yes, it's really me It's Maui Breathe it in I know it's a lot The hair The bod When you're staring at a demigod What can I say except You're welcome For the tides, the sun, the sky Hey, it's okay, it's okay You're welcome I'm just an ordinary demiguy Hey!
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky When you were waddling yay high?
This guy When the nights got cold Who stole you fire from down below?
You're looking at him yo Oh also I lassoed the sun You're welcome To stretch your days and bring you fun Also I harnessed the breeze You're welcome To fill your sails and shake your trees So what can I say except You're welcome For the islands I pulled from the sea There's no need to pray It's okay You're welcome Ha I guess it's just my way of being me You're welcome You're welcome Well come to think of it Kid, honestly I could go on and on I could explain every natural phenomenon The tide, the grass, the ground Oh that was Maui just messing around I killed an eel I buried its guts Sprouted a tree Now you got coconuts What's the lesson?
What is the take away?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway And the tapestry here on my skin Is a map of the victories I win Look where I've been I make everything happen Look at that Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin' Ha ha Ha ha Ha ha Hey Well anyway let me say You're welcome You're welcome For the wonderful world you know Hey, it's okay, it's okay You're welcome You're welcome Well come to think of it I gotta go Hey it's your day to say You're welcome You're welcome 'Cause I'm gonna need that boat I'm sailing away away You're welcome You're welcome 'Cause Maui can do everything but float You're welcome You're welcome You're welcome You're welcome Huh?
And thank you!
Hey!
Let me out!
You lying, slimy son of a...
You're welcome You're so welcome.
No.
I'm not going to Te Fiti with some kid.
I'm going to get my hook.
You have yours and I'm not Maui without mine.
Okay, talk to the back.
Boat snack.
Good riddance, you filthy pile of pebbles.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.
I could watch that all day.
Okay.
Enjoy the island.
Maui, out.
No!
Stop!
Hey!
You have to put back the heart!
Did not see that coming.
I am Moana of Motunui.
This is my canoe... and you will journey to...
All right, get over it.
We gotta move.
And she's back.
I am Moana of Motunui...
It was Moana, right?
Yes.
And you will restore the heart!
All right.
I'm out.
Oh, come on!
What is your problem?
Are you afraid of it?
No!
No.
I'm not afraid.
Stay out of it or you're sleeping in my armpit.
You, stop it.
That is not a heart.
It is a curse.
The second I took it, I got blasted outta the sky... and I lost my hook.
Get it away from me.
Get this away?
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm a demigod, okay?
Stop that.
I will smite you!
You wanna get smote?
Smotten?
Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life... it's a homing beacon of death.
If you don't put it away, bad things are gonna come for it.
Come for this?
The heart?
You mean this heart right here?
Don't, you can't raise your voice like that!
Come and get it!
You are gonna get us killed!
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti, so you can put it back.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Kakamora.
Kaka-what?
Murdering little pirates.
Wonder what they're here for.
They're kinda cute.
Ocean!
Do something!
Help us!
The ocean doesn't help you, you help yourself!
Tighten the halyard.
Bind the stays!
You can't sail?
I am self-taught.
Can't you shapeshift or something?
Do you see my hook?
No magic hook, no magic powers!
Their boat is turning into more boats!
Yep, I just did that.
No, no!
Heihei!
Maui!
They took the heart!
That's a chicken.
The heart is in the...
We have to get him back!
Maui!
Cheeeehoooo!
There!
Right there!
You're turning?
What are you doing?
Escaping!
The heart!
Forget it!
You'll never get it back!
Besides, you got a better one.
Hey!
What am I gonna steer with?
They're just gonna kill ya!
Coconuts.
Got it!
Hey!
Yeah!
We did it!
Congratulations on not being dead, girlie.
You surprise me.
But I'm still not taking that thing back.
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta go through a whole ocean of bad.
Not to mention Te Kā.
Lava monster?
Ever defeat a lava monster?
No.
Have you?
I'm not going on a suicide mission with some mortal.
You can't restore the heart without me... and me says no.
I'm getting my hook.
End of discussion.
You'd be a hero.
That's what you're all about, right?
Little girl, I am a hero.
Maybe you were.
But now... now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti.
The guy who cursed the world.
You're no one's hero.
No one?
But... put this back... save the world... you'd be everyone's hero.
Maui!
Maui!
Maui!
You're so amazing!
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.
Then we get your hook.
We get your hook, take out Te Kā, restore the heart.
Unless you don't wanna be...
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.
Hero to... all.
First, we get my hook.
Then save the world.
Deal?
Deal.
Worth a shot.
Okay, we go east.
To the lair of Tamatoa.
If anyone has my hook, it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.
Teach me to sail.
My job is to deliver Maui across the great ocean.
I should...
I should be sailing.
It's called wayfinding, princess.
And it's not just sails and knots... it's seeing where you're going in your mind.
Knowing where you are... by knowing where you've been.
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.
I am the daughter of the chief.
Same difference.
No.
If you wear a dress, and you have an animal sidekick... you're a princess.
You are not a wayfinder.
You will never be a wayfinder, you will never be a...
Really?
Blow dart in my butt cheek?
You are a bad person.
If you can talk, you can teach.
Wayfinding.
Lesson one.
Hit it.
Pull the sheet.
Not the sheet.
No.
Nope.
Nope.
No.
Tried that one already.
You're measuring the stars, not giving the sky a high-five.
If the current's warm, you're going the right way.
It's cold.
Wait, it's getting warmer.
That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?
We're here?
See, told you I could do it!
Motunui?
I'm home?
Moana!
Dad?
Moana!
Mom?
Help!
No!
Moana!
Enjoy your beauty rest?
You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps... so they actually get where they need to go.
Muscle up, buttercup.
We're here.
You're sure this guy's gonna have your hook?
Tamatoa?
Oh, he'll have it.
He's a scavenger.
Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.
And for Tamatoa, trust me... my hook is the coolest collectible.
And he lives up there?
No, no, no.
That's just the entrance... to Lalotai.
Lalotai?
Realm of monsters?
We're going to the realm of monsters?
We?
No.
Me.
You are gonna stay here with the other chicken.
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.
Come on.
That was a good one.
How do you not get it?
I called her a chicken, there's a chicken on the boat.
I know she's human, but that's not the...
You know what?
Forget it.
Forget it!
I'm not explaining it to you. 'Cause then it's not funny.
So, daughter of the chief...
I thought you stayed in the village.
You know, kissing babies and things.
Hey, I'm just trying to understand... why your people decided to send...
How do I phrase this?
You.
My people didn't send me.
The ocean did.
The ocean?
Makes sense.
You're what, eight?
Can't sail.
Obvious choice.
It chose me for a reason.
If the ocean's so smart... why didn't it just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself?
Or bring me my hook?
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.
You're the Chosen One!
The ocean chose you for a reason.
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.
So, not seeing an entrance.
Yes, because it only appears... after a human sacrifice.
Kidding.
So serious.
Don't worry... it's a lot farther down than it looks.
Cheeeehoooo!
I am still falling!
You can do this.
Go!
And he sticks the landing.
What?
Dum-dum, she's not even here.
No mortal's gonna jump into the realm of...
Huh?
Well, she's dead.
Okay, let's get my hook.
Maui's fishhook!
Yeah!
Sorry!
I thought you were a monster...
But I found your hook.
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy really likes his treasure.
Stay.
What?
No.
I'm the one who found...
Listen.
For a thousand years...
I've only been thinking of keeping this hair silky... getting my hook... and being awesome again.
And it's not getting screwed up by a mortal... who has no business inside of a monster cave, except...
Except... maybe as bait.
Huh?
Wow!
The shiny, glittery cave.
And just like me... it is covered in sparkly treasure.
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.
You're not selling it!
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.
When he shows up, keep him distracted.
Make him talk about himself.
He loves bragging about how great he is.
You two must get along swell.
No, not since I ripped off his leg.
You ripped off his...
Maui?
What have we here?
It's a sparkly, shiny...
Wait a minute.
It's a human!
What are you doing down here, in the realm of the...
Just pick an eye, babe.
I can't concentrate on what I'm saying if you keep...
Yeah, pick one, pick one!
You're a funny-looking little thing, aren't you?
Don't!
That's my gramma's! "That's my gramma's!" I ate my gramma!
And it took a week, 'cause she was absolutely humongous.
Why are you here? 'Cause you're amazing!
And we mortals have heard of the tale of the crab who became a legend!
And I just had to know... how you became so... crabulous?
Are you just trying to get me to talk about myself?
Because if you are...
I will gladly do so.
Huh?
In song form!
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam I was a drab little crab once Now I know I can be happy as a clam Because I'm beautiful, baby And did your granny say Listen to your heart Be who you are on the inside I need three words To tear her argument apart Your granny lied I'd rather be shiny Like a treasure From a sunken pirate wreck Scrub the deck And make it look shiny I will sparkle like a Wealthy woman's neck Just a sec Don't ya know Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb They chase anything that glitters Beginners Oh, and here they come, come, come To the brightest thing that glitters Mm, fish dinners I just love free food And you look like seafood Hey, crab cake!
I'm back.
It's Maui Time!
What do you say, little buddy?
Giant hawk?
Coming up!
Cheeeehoooo!
Cheeeehoooo!
Well, well, well.
Little Maui's having trouble with his look Ya little semi-demi-mini-god Ouch What a terrible performance Get the hook Get it?
You don't swing it Like you used to, man Yet I have to give you Credit for my start And your tattoos on the outside For just like you I made myself a work of art I'll never hide I can't I'm too shiny Watch me dazzle Like a diamond in the rough Strut my stuff My stuff is so shiny Send your armies But they'll never be enough My shell's too tough Maui, man You can try, try, try But you can't expect a demigod To beat a decapod Look it up You will die, die, die Now it's time for me to take apart Your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you Chasing the love of these humans Who made you feel wanted You tried to be tough But your armor's just not hard enough Maui Now it's time to kick your heinie Ever seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'Cause it's the last you'll ever see C'est la vie Mon ami I'm so shiny Now I eat you so prepare your final plea Just for me You'll never be quite as shiny You wish you were nice and shiny Hey!
Huh?
I got something shiny for ya!
The heart of Te Fiti.
You can't run from me!
Oh, you can.
You keep surprising me.
There's only so far you can get on those two little legs.
The power of creation... for a crustacean.
Where is it?
Where is it?
We gotta go!
What about the heart?
He can have it.
I've got a better one.
Yes, I have the...
Wait a minute.
I see, she's taken a barnacle and she's covered it in... bioluminescent algae as a diversion.
Come back here!
Cheeeehoooo!
Hey!
Did you like the song?
We're alive!
We're alive!
Listen...
I appreciate what you did down there.
Mm-hmm.
Took guts.
Mm-hmm.
But...
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to be sincere for once, and it feels like you're distracted.
No, no.
No way!
Really?
Because you're looking at me like I have a... shark head.
What?
Do you have a shark head?
Look, the point is... for a little girl, child, thing, whatever... who had no business being down there... you did me a solid.
But you also almost died.
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.
So, chances of beating Te Kā?
Bupkis.
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.
It's not cursed.
Shark head.
It is not cursed.
Cursed.
What can I say except We're dead soon We're dead soon Can you at least try?
Giant hawk.
Hey, it's okay, it's okay We're dead soon All right, break time's over.
Get up.
Why?
Are you gonna give me a speech?
Tell me I can beat Te Kā 'cause I'm "Maui?" Take a hike, Tiny.
How do you get your tattoos?
They show up.
When I earn them.
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?
That's man's discovery of Nunya.
What's Nunya?
Nunya business.
I'll just keep asking.
What's it for?
You need to stop doing that.
Back off.
Just tell me what it is.
I said back off.
Is it why your hook's not working?
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.
You wanna throw me off the boat... throw me off.
You wanna tell me I don't know what I'm doing...
I know I don't.
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.
You're right.
But my island is dying... so I am here.
It's just me and you.
And I want to help... but I can't if you don't let me.
I wasn't born a demigod.
I had human parents.
They took one look and decided... they did not want me.
They threw me into the sea... like I was nothing.
Somehow, I was found by the gods.
They gave me the hook.
They made me...
Maui.
And back to the humans I went.
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.
Anything they could ever want.
You took the heart for them.
You did everything for them.
So they'd love you.
It was never enough.
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.
Maybe the ocean brought you to them... because it saw someone who was worthy of being saved.
But the gods aren't the ones who make you Maui.
You are.
Okay, okay.
I love you, too, buddy.
Cheeeehoooo!
Yeah!
Next stop, Te Fiti.
What?
I figured it out.
You know, the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands... 'cause your ancestors would sail her seas and find 'em.
All those new lands, new villages.
It was the water that connected 'em all.
And if I were the ocean...
I think I'd be looking for a curly-haired non-princess... to start that again.
That is literally the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti.
I did.
Moana of Motunui...
I believe you have officially delivered Maui across the great sea.
Moana!
Moana!
Moana!
You're so amazing!
It's time.
Go save the world.
Cheeeehoooo!
Maui!
What are you doing?
Finding you a better way in!
We won't make it!
Yes, we will!
Turn around!
No!
Moana, stop!
No!
Are you okay?
Maui?
I told you to turn back.
I thought we could make it.
We?
I thought I could make it.
We can fix it.
It was made by the gods.
You can't fix it!
Next time we'll be more careful.
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.
It's lava, it can't go in the water.
We can find a way around.
I'm not going back.
We still have to restore the heart.
My hook is cracked.
One more hit, and it's over.
Maui, you have to restore the heart.
Without my hook, I am nothing.
That's not true!
Without my hook, I am nothing!
We are only here... because you stole the heart in the first place.
No, we're here because the ocean told you you're special... and you believed it.
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...
Goodbye, Moana. ...sail across the sea...
I'm not killing myself... so you can prove you're something you're not! ...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!
The ocean chose me!
It chose wrong.
Maui!
Why did you bring me here?
I'm not the right person.
You have to choose someone else.
Choose someone else.
Please.
No.
You're a long ways past the reef.
Gramma?
Guess I chose the right tattoo.
Gramma!
I tried, Gramma.
I couldn't do it.
It's not your fault.
I never should have put so much on your shoulders.
If you are ready to go home...
I will be with you.
Why do you hesitate?
I don't know.
I know a girl from an island She stands apart from the crowd She loves the sea and her people She makes her whole family proud Sometimes the world seems against you The journey may leave a scar But scars can heal and reveal just Where you are The people you love will change you The things you have learned will guide you And nothing on earth can silence The quiet voice still inside you And when that voice starts to whisper Moana, you've come so far Moana, listen Do you know who you are?
Who am I?
I am a girl who loves my island And the girl who loves the sea It calls me I am the daughter of the village chief We are descended from voyagers Who found their way across the world They call me I've delivered us to where we are I have journeyed farther I am everything I've learned and more Still it calls me And the call isn't out there at all It's inside me It's like the tide Always falling and rising I will carry you here in my heart You remind me That come what may I know the way I am Moana I am Moana of Motunui.
Aboard my boat...
I will sail across the sea... and restore the heart of Te Fiti.
Te Kā can't follow us into the water.
We make it past the barrier islands... we make it to Te Fiti.
None of which you understand... because you are a chicken.
No!
Heihei!
No, no, no!
Nice work!
Te Fiti.
Maui!
You came back.
But your hook.
One more hit and...
Te Kā's gotta catch me first.
I got your back, Chosen One.
Go save the world.
Maui.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Cheeeehoooo!
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!
Hey, Te Kā!
Shark head!
Cheeeehoooo!
Moana!
Get the heart to the spiral!
Te Fiti... it's gone.
Te Kā!
Let her come to me.
I have crossed the horizon to find you I know your name They have stolen the heart from inside you But this does not define you This is not who you are You know who you are Who you truly are.
Te Fiti!
The chicken lives.
I'm sorry about your hook.
Well, hook, no hook...
I'm Maui.
Te Fiti!
Hey, I mean, how you been?
Look, what I did was... wrong.
I have no excuse.
I'm sorry.
You know, it'd be rude to refuse a gift from a goddess.
Cheeeehoooo!
Thank you.
Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.
Cheeeehoooo.
Gonna miss you, drumstick.
You could come with us, you know.
My people are going to need a master wayfinder.
They already have one.
See you out there, Maui.
See you out there, Moana.
Cheeeehoooo!
Mom!
Dad!
Moana!
I may have gone a little ways past the reef.
It suits you.
She's back!
Moana!
Pua!
Moana!
Welcome home!
We set a course to find A brand new island everywhere we roam We keep our island in our mind And when it's time to find home We know the way We are explorers reading every sign We tell the stories of our elders In a never-ending chain We know the way Shiny I'm so shiny Didn't help me though, did it?
Still upside down here.
Just need a little push.
Can we be real?
If my name was Sebastian and I had a cool Jamaican accent... you'd totally help me.
You would.
You know you would.
Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a shining castle.
Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish and unkind.
But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away.
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.
The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart.
And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there.
Ashamed of his monstrous form, the Beast concealed himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his 21st year.
If he could learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken.
If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.
As the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast? ♪ Little town, it's a quiet village ♪ Every day like the one before ♪ Little town, full of little people ♪ Waking up to say... ♪ There goes the baker ♪ with his tray, like always ♪ The same old bread and rolls to sell ♪ Every morning just the same ♪ Since the morning that we came ♪ To this poor provincial town Good morning, Belle.

Bonjour, Gaston.
Gaston, may I have my book, please?
How can you read this?
There's no pictures.
Well, some people use their imagination.
Belle, it's about time you got your head out of those books and paid attention to more important things.
Like me.
The whole town's talking about it.
It's not right for a woman to read.
Soon she starts getting ideas and thinking.
Gaston, you are positively primeval.
Why, thank you, Belle.
What do you say you and me take a walk over to the tavern and take a look at my trophies?
Maybe some other time.
What's wrong with her?
She's crazy.
He's gorgeous.
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.
Goodbye.
That crazy old loon.
He needs all the help he can get.
Don't talk about my father that way.
Yeah!
Don't talk about her father that way.
My father is not crazy.
He's a genius.
Papa?
How on earth did that happen?
Doggone it!
Are you all right, Papa?
I'm...
I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk.
You always say that.
I mean it this time!
I'll never get this boneheaded contraption to work!
Yes, you will.
And you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow.
And become a world-famous inventor.
You really believe that?
I always have.
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.
Hand me that...
The dog-legged clincher there.
So, did you have a good time in town today?
I got a new book.
Papa, do you think I'm odd?
My daughter?
Odd?
Where would you get an idea like that?
I don't know.
It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here.
There's no one I can really talk to.
What about that Gaston?
He's a handsome fella.
He's handsome, all right, and rude and conceited and...
Papa, he's not for me.
Well, don't you worry. 'Cause this invention's gonna be the start of a new life for us.
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.
It works!
It does?
It does!
You did it.
You really did it!
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!
Goodbye, Papa.
Good luck.
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.
We should be there by now.
Maybe we missed a turn.
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.
No.
Let's go this way.
Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut.
We'll be there in no time.
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We better turn around.
Whoa.
Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.
Look out!
No!
Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Back up, back up, back up!
Good boy.
Good boy.
That's good, that's...
Back up!
Steady, steady, now.
Steady.
Steady.
No, Philippe!
Philippe?
Help!
Is...
Is someone there?
Help!
Hello?
Hello!
Poor fellow must have lost his way in the woods.
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.
Is someone there?
Not a word, Lumiere.
Not one word.
I don't mean to intrude, but I've lost my horse and I need a place to stay for the night.
Cogsworth, have a heart.
Of course, monsieur, you are welcome here.
Who said that?
Over here.
Where?
Hello.
Incredible!
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.
Splendid.
Just peachy.
How is this accomplished?
Put me down at once.
Stop that!
Stop that, I say!
Sir, close that at once!
Do you mind?
I beg your pardon.
It's...
It's just that I've never seen a clock that...
You are soaked to the bone, monsieur.
Come.
Warm yourself by the fire.
Thank you.
No, no, no!
You know what the master will do if he finds him here.
I demand that you stop right there.
No, no.
Not the master's chair.
I'm not seeing this.
I'm not seeing this.
Well, hello there, boy.
What service.
All right.
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...
How would you like a nice spot of tea, sir?
It'll warm you up in no time.
No.
No tea.
No tea!
His mustache tickles, Mama.
Hello.
There's a stranger here.
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.
He was cold and wet, so...
Master, I'd like to take this moment to say I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me?
No, no...
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I...
I...
I was lost in the woods and...
You are not welcome here!
I...
I'm...
I'm sorry.
What are you staring at?
Nothing.
So, you've come to stare at the Beast, have you?
Please, I meant no harm!
I just needed a place to stay.
I'll give you a place to stay!
No, no, please!
No!
No!
Oh, boy.
Belle's gonna get the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?
Yep, this is her lucky day.
I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding.
First, I better go in there and propose to the girl.
And you, LeFou, now, when Belle and I come out that door...
I know.
I know.
I strike up the band!
Not yet.
Sorry.
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.
You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.
This is the day...
This is the day your dreams come true.
What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty!
Here.
Picture this.
A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting on the fire and my little wife massaging my feet while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs.
We'll have six or seven.
Dogs?
No, Belle.
Strapping boys like me.
Imagine that.
Do you know who that little wife will be?
Let me think.
You, Belle.
Gaston, I'm...
I'm speechless.
I really don't know what to say.
Say you'll marry me.
I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...
But I just don't deserve you!
So, how'd it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife.
Make no mistake about that.
Touchy.
Is he gone?
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

Where's...
Where's Papa?
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?
We have to find him.
You have to take me to him.
What is this place?
Philippe, please, steady.
Steady.
Papa!
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?
Just had to invite him to stay, didn't we?
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
Pet the pooch. [L]I was trying to be hospitable.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Papa?
Papa?
Are you here?
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.
Now, Chip, I'll not have you making up such wild stories.
Really, Mama.
I saw her.
Not another word.
Into the tub.
But...
What?
A girl.
I saw a girl in the castle.
See, I told you.
Irresponsible, devil-may-care, waxy-eared, slack-jawed...
Papa?
Did you see that?
It's a girl!
I know it's a girl.
Don't you see?
She's the one.
The girl we have been waiting for. [L]-She has come to break the spell. [L]-Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Papa?
Papa?
Hello?
Is someone here?
Wait!
I'm looking for my father.
I...
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.
Is anyone here?
Belle?
Papa!
How did you find me?
Your hands are like ice.
We have to get you out of there.
Belle, I want you to leave this place.
Who's done this to you?
No time to explain.
You must go.
Now!
I won't leave you.
What are you doing here?
Run, Belle!
Who's there?
Who are you?
The master of this castle.
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.
Can't you see he's sick?
Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.
There must be some way I can...
Wait!
Take me instead.
You?
You would take his place?
Belle, no!
You don't know what you're doing!
If I did, would you let him go?
Yes.
But you must promise to stay here forever.
Come into the light.
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!
You have my word.
Done.
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old.
I've lived my life.
Wait. [L]-Belle! [L]-Wait.
No!
Please spare my daughter.
Please!
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.
Let me out.
Please let me out!
Let me out!
Please!
Please!
Master?
What?
Since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time, I was thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable room. [L]Then again, maybe not.
You didn't even let me say goodbye.
I'll never see him again.
I didn't get to say goodbye.
I'll show you to your room.
My room?
But I thought...
You wanna...
You wanna stay in the tower? [L]-No. [L]-Then follow me.
Say something to her.
I hope you like it here.
The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like, except the west wing.
What's in the west...
It's forbidden!
Now, if you need anything, my servants will attend you.
Dinner.
Invite her to dinner.
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!
Who does she think she is?
That girl has tangled with the wrong man.
No one says no to Gaston.
Darn right.
Dismissed.
Rejected.
Publicly humiliated.
Why, it's more than I can bear.
More beer?
What for?
Nothing helps. [L]-I'm disgraced. [L]-Who, you?
Never.

Maurice?
Please!
Please, I need your help.
He's got her...
He's got her locked in the dungeon.
Who?
Belle.
We must go.
Not...
Not a minute to lose.
Whoa!
Slow down, Maurice.
Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous beast!
Is it a big beast?
Huge.
With a long, ugly snout?
Hideously ugly.
And sharp, cruel fangs?
Yes, yes!
Will you help me?
All right, old man.
We'll help you out. [L]You will? [L]Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Who is it?
Mrs.
Potts, dear.
I thought you might like a spot of tea.
But you're...
You're a...
Careful.
This is impossible.
I know it is, but here we are.
I told you she was pretty, Mama, didn't I?
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now.
Don't spill.
Thank you.
Wanna see me do a trick?
Chip!
Sorry.
That was a very brave thing you did, my dear.
We all think so.
But I've lost my father, my dreams, everything.
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.
Listen to me jabbering on while there's a supper to get on the table.
Chip?
Bye.
Well, now, what shall we dress you in for dinner?
Let's see what I got in my drawers.
How embarrassing!
Here we are.
You'll look ravishing in this one.
That's very kind of you, but I'm not going to dinner.
But you must.
Dinner is served.
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.
Why isn't she here yet?
Try to be patient, sir.
The girl has lost her father and her freedom all in one day.
Master, have you thought that perhaps this girl could be the one to break the spell?
Of course I have!
I'm not a fool.
Good!
So, you fall in love with her, she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.
It's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.
But the rose has already begun to wilt.
It's no use.
She's so beautiful and I'm...
Well, look at me!
You must help her to see past all that.
I don't know how.
Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable.
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.
Yes.
When she comes in, give her a dashing, debonair smile.
Come, come, show me the smile.
But don't frighten the poor girl.
Impress her with your rapier wit.
But be gentle.
Shower her with compliments.
But be sincere.
And above all, you must control your temper!
You must control your temper!
Here she is!
Good evening.
Well, where is she?
Who?
The girl, yes.
The girl.
Well, actually, she's in the process of...
Circumstances being what they are...
She's not coming.
What?
Oh, dear.
Your Grace!
Your Eminence! [L]Let's not be hasty!
I thought I told you to come down to dinner!
I'm not hungry.
You'll come out or I'll...
I'll...
I'll break down the door!
Master, I could be wrong, but that may not be the best way to win the girl's affections.
Please attempt to be a gentleman.
But she is being so difficult.
Gently, gently.
Will you come down to dinner?
No!
Suave, genteel.
It would give me great pleasure if you would join me for dinner.
And we say "please." Please.
No, thank you.
You can't stay in there forever!
Yes, I can.
Fine!
Then go ahead and starve!
If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all!
Oh, dear.
That didn't go very well at all, did it?
Lumiere, stand watch at the door and inform me at once if there is the slightest change.
You can count on me, mon capitaine.
Well, we might as well go downstairs and start cleaning up.
I ask nicely, but she refuses.
What does she want me to do, beg?
Show me the girl.
But the master's really not so bad, once you get to know him.
Why don't you give him a chance?
I don't want to get to know him.
I don't want to have anything to do with him.
I'm just fooling myself.
She'll never see me as anything but a monster.
It's hopeless.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
I've been burned by you before.
Zut alors!
She has emerged!
Come on, Chip.
Into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters.
But I'm not sleepy.
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
I work and I slave all day long, and for what?
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!
Stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.
Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn.
After all, he did say "please." But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper, he'll never break the...
Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle.
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.
This is Lumiere.
Enchanté, chérie.
If there's, stop that, anything we, please, can do to make your stay more comfortable...
I am a little hungry.
You are?
Hear that?
She's hungry.
Stoke the fire.
Break out the silver.
Wake the china.
Remember what the master said.
Pish tosh.
I'm not about to let the poor child go hungry.
All right, fine.
Glass of water, crust of bread and then... [L]Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest.
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.
Well, keep it down.
If the master finds out about this, it will be our necks.
Of course, of course.
But what is dinner without a little music?
Music?
It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.

Thank you.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it?
Everyone!
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
I couldn't possibly go to bed now.
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.
Enchanted!
Who said anything about the castle being enchanted?
It was you, wasn't it?
I figured it out for myself.
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.
Would you like a tour?
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
We can't let her go poking around in certain places, if you know what I mean.
Perhaps you'd like to take me.
I'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle.
Well.
Actually, I...
Yes, I do.
As you can see, the pseudo-facade was stripped away to reveal the minimalist Rococo design.
Note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings.
This is yet another example of the late-neoclassic Baroque period.
And, as I always say, if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.
Where was I?
As you were!
Now, then, if I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the... [L]Mademoiselle?
What's up there?
Where?
There?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing.
Dusty, dull, very boring.
So, that's the west wing!
Nice going.
I wonder what he's hiding up there.
Hiding?
The master is hiding nothing.
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
Perhaps mademoiselle would like to see something else?
We have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to...
Maybe later.
The gardens.
Or...
Or the...
The library, perhaps?
You have a library?
Yes.
Indeed.
With books.
Scads of books.
Mountains of books.
Forests of books.
Cascades.
Cloudbursts.
Swamps of books.
More books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime.
Books on every subject ever studied by every author who ever set pen to paper.
Why did you come here?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I warned you never to come here!
I didn't mean any harm.
Do you realize what you could have done?
Please!
Stop!
Get out!
No!
Get out!
Where are you going?
Promise or no promise, I can't stay here another minute.
No, wait, please!
Please, wait!
No!
Here, now.
Don't do that.
Just hold still.
That hurts!
If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much!
Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened.
If you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away.
Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing!
Well, you should learn to control your temper.
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.
By the way, thank you for saving my life.
You're welcome.
I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night, but he said you'd make it worth my while.
I'm listening.
It's like this.
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle, but she needs a little persuasion.
Turned him down flat.
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.
He was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is, Belle would do anything to keep him from being locked up.
Yeah, even marry him.
So, you want me to throw her father into the asylum, unless she agrees to marry you.
That is despicable.
I love it.
If no one will help me, then I'll go back alone.
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...
I'll get her out of there.
Belle!
Maurice!
Oh, well.
Guess it's not gonna work, after all.
They have to come back sometime.
And when they do, we'll be ready for them.
LeFou, don't move from that spot until Belle and her father come home.
But...
But I...
Nuts.
I've never felt this way about anyone.
I want to do something for her.
But what?
Well, there's the usual things.
Flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep.
No, no.
It has to be something very special.
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute.
Belle?
There's something I want to show you.
But first, you have to close your eyes.
It's a surprise.
Can I open them?
No, no.
Not yet.
Wait here.
Now can I open them?
All right.
Now.
I can't believe it.
I've never seen so many books in all my life.
You...
You like it?
It's wonderful.
Then it's yours.
Thank you so much.
Would you look at that!
I knew it would work.
What?
What works?
It's very encouraging.
Isn't this exciting?
I didn't see anything.
Come along, Chip.

I'll tell you when you're older.
Tonight is the night.
I'm not sure I can do this.
You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.
Bold.
Daring.
There will be music, romantic candlelight provided by myself.
And when the moment is right, you confess your love.
Yes, I...
I...
I...
No, I can't.
You care for the girl, don't you?
More than anything.
Well, then, you must tell her.
Voilà!
You look so, so...
Stupid.
Not quite the word I was looking for.

Good night, love.
Belle?
Are you happy here with me?
Yes.
What is it?
If only I could see my father again, just for a moment.
I miss him so much.
There is a way.
This mirror will show you anything.
Anything you wish to see.
I'd like to see my father, please.
Papa.
Oh, no.
He's sick.
He may be dying, and he's all alone.
Then you must go to him.
What did you say?
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.
You mean I'm free?
Yes.
Thank you.
Hold on, Papa.
I'm on my way.
Take it with you so you'll always have a way to look back and remember me.
Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.
Well, Your Highness, I must say everything is going just swimmingly.
I knew you had it in you.
I let her go.
Yes, yes...
You what?
How could you do that?
I had to.
Yes, but...
But why?
Because I love her.
He did what?
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
She's going away?
But he was so close.
After all this time, he's finally learned to love.
That's it then.
That should break the spell.
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.
Now it's too late.
Papa?
Papa?
They're back.
Belle.
It's all right, Papa.
I'm home.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I missed you so much!
But the Beast...
Did you...
How did you escape?
I didn't escape, Papa.
He...
He let me go.
That horrible beast?
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.
Hi!
A stowaway.
Why, hello there, little fella.
Didn't think I'd see you again.
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us anymore? [L]Chip, of course I do.
It's just that...
May I help you?
I've come to collect your father.
My father?
Don't worry, mademoiselle.
We'll take good care of him.
My father's not crazy!
He was raving like a lunatic!
We all heard him, didn't we?
Yes!
No, I won't let you!
Belle?
Maurice, tell us again, old man.
Just how big was the beast?
He was...
I mean, he was...
He was enormous!
I'd...
I'd say at least eight, no, more like 10 feet!
Well, you don't get much crazier than that.
It's true, I tell you.
Get him out of here!
Let go of me!
No!
You can't do this!
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding if...
If what?
If you marry me.
What?
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.
Never!
Have it your way.
Belle?
Let go of me!
My father's not crazy and I can prove it.
Show me the Beast.
Is it dangerous?
No, no, he'd never hurt anyone.
Please, I know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle.
He's my friend.
If I didn't know better, I'd think you had feelings for this monster.
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are! [L]She's as crazy as the old man.
The Beast will make off with your children.
He'll come after them in the night.
No.

Hi, this is Ron Clements, I'm the co-writer, co-director of Little Mermaid.
Hi, I'm John Musker, I'm the other guy, the other co-director, co-writer of The Little Mermaid.
Hi, I'm Alan Menken, the composer of Little Mermaid.
You're gonna hear a lot on this audio commentary about Howard Ashman, who I consider to be the greatest theatrical dramatic talent of our generation, as a writer.
Howard passed away before Beauty and the Beast was released and after Little Mermaid came out.
Coming up is an earlier interview that Howard and I did at the time of the release of the film, and it's great to hear his voice adding to ours.
This is Ron again.
We had a really tough time getting this to work right with the ship coming through the fog.
This is John.
This was generated by a computer but then painted in traditional ink and paint style.
You really saw a change in perspective there, in a way that we couldn't have done with traditional animation.
We tried to keep color very low-key, it's kind of an overcast day, because we wanted to save the color for when we went underwater...
We shot this with traditional fog filters on the animation camera just to give it the feeling of a foggy day.
This is Alan, and I remember how many times Howard and I took stabs at the top of the movie musically.
We had a much longer song, originally, which told the whole story of Eric and the boat.
The back story of the witch and Triton, there was a whole story created.
And a lot of dancing and sweeping.
It's a big, elaborate production number.
And it actually got story-boarded.
Roger Alters, the great story artist, story-boarded it, it exists.
Ultimately, it seemed like it took a little too long and was too involved, so we went with a shorter, trimmer version.
One thing we did want to do, though, was to start the movie on the water surface and save going below, 'cause we felt it was like going to Oz or something like that.
So, it's almost like this is our black-and-white section going into color now.
Classic moment for me is when the fish jumps and hits the water and we go into this theme, and that's where the heart of the movie just jumps out at you.
I remember we demoed this so many times.
I can remember you and Howard Ashman were sitting there at the piano, and Howard would be like, "Alan, give me that musical figure," "something watery, something watery." That's right.
And then Alan would come up with this thing.
I'd never even heard the term "musical figure" before, and I'm like, "Well, that's what that is." I'd create this little...
It came off the top of my head, and it became this unmistakable stamp, now, of Little Mermaid. -Musical signature.
Anytime one hears it...
And also, with any musical, and Howard would say this too, you have to establish right at the top what are the rules for this musical.
If somebody is coming out and they're on a stage, and they're singing All That Jazz, you go, "Okay, I get what this is." If somebody comes out and they're animated, and they're doing a sea shanty about the fable of The Little Mermaid, you go, "Okay, I get..." So long as you get what world you're in, you can accept it.
Ron again.
This first shot of King Triton's palace is a multi-plane shot.
After CAPS was developed, a shot like this would be easy, but at the time, if you wanted to move in on something and give some sense of dimension, you needed to use multi-plane.
I think this film was the first use of multi-plane since...
I think there might be a shot in Jungle Book, which was kind of reused in The Rescuers, I think.
Those trumpet fish were the first real explosion -of higher key colors.
Really bright color.
If you look, still-frame, as he passes in front of the camera, on the lower left corner of the screen, you can see Mickey, Donald and Goofy there in the audience, watching.
Will Ryan did the voice of the little seahorse.
Speeded up a little bit.
You hear the fanfare as Triton sweeps in, and then when Sebastian comes in, there's a little dinky fanfare, and that is actually me playing the kazoo.
Listen to the last note particularly.
We did have fun.
Sam Wright and Ken Mars doing the voices of Sebastian the crab and King Triton.
Sam Wright was wonderful to work with.
He's been playing Mufasa in The Lion King on Broadway, but prior to that, he'd been the father in a musical called Tap Dance Kid.
He was in the Fruit of the Loom commercials as a dancing raisin or something.
A great, great comic actor and singer.
He was one of the New York actors, both he and Jodi Benson were cast without John or I having ever met them in person, we just heard their voices on tape, 'cause they auditioned in New York, but we loved what they were doing.
Ellen Woodbury did some of this animation here. -And Will Finn I think did some.
And Will Finn as well, yeah.
In the lyrics coming up in this song, when you talk about the sisters, among the sisters, Atina is a musical I had written, actually, that Michael Bennett produced, called Atina: Evil Queen of the Galaxy, which was a big flopperoney.
Arista, Attina Adella, Alana And Howard, in the lyrics, makes reference to Alana, and that was Howard's way of including me in the lyrics.
One other bit, Andrina was actually my aerobics teacher at the time, -I was taking an aerobics class.
Is that right?
We used to have more dialogue in this scene, we had a backstage scene that got cut out.
It's like, "Where's Ariel?
She's not here!
What am I gonna do?" And then he's forced out onto the stage.
We just liked the staging of the shells opening.
It just seemed kind of fun and it's a little campy, I guess.
But we liked it and Howard went along with it eventually, but we had to sell him on the idea.
Howard always had very specific ideas of how he visualized the staging.
This set-up shot of the sunken ship has cross-dissolving beams.
Mike Peraza, our art director, did the layout for this.
It really helps set a great mood for the rest of this sequence.
We knew this movie would have more effects animation than any movie that had been done in a long time.
And virtually every scene underwater has effects in it, it has either bubbles, or light refractions or distortion.
It added a huge amount of complexity, but it's just a really great motivator in getting the whole crew together, knowing that they were facing, in some sense...
I think we presented it as almost an impossible challenge.
People like impossible challenges, because it gets them excited, and I think the whole effects department was very excited about the challenge of this film.
Alan had never written an underscore for any movie before, and he wanted to do it, and we were interested in doing it, but he'd never done it before, "so we said," Let's use this as kind of a dry run, so to speak, "or a trial run, and let Alan get his fins wet on this one." So, this was the first thing he wrote.
I was terrified.
It was an action cue, it wasn't just a romantic cue, it was something where you really had to hook into the...
There's a big shark chase coming up and all that stuff, so Alan had to hit all these accents and beats and all that, so it was something different for Alan.
And I also remember, when we scored the movie, this was the first cue that we recorded.
I remember sitting next to the orchestrator, I listened to it, and I said, "Oh, my God, this is awful." "Oh, my God, this is just terrible." And I see Howard and John and Ron conferring at the front, their heads are down and they're talking to each other. "And I'm thinking," Oh, my God, "they're trying to figure out how to fire me." Then finally Howard gets up slowly and walks over to me behind the board.
I said, "Yeah, I know it's terrible.
We can work on..." He says, "No, in this one measure, "could you move this one beat forward?" I said, "Yes. "He says, "That's great." I made a choice to do this very much in the style of the earlier animated features, in which, instead of sound effects, you're basically using music for a fall, or music for an impact or for anything, almost like ballet.
So, it's a very busy score.
I learned how to get less busy after Little Mermaid.
I might also mention that the shark here is animated by Matt O'Callaghan, who story-boarded this sequence as well, and that doesn't always happen.
So, he really shaped it, both in terms of the storyboarding, and then he wound up animating the shark, as well as Louis, the chef, later on.
The shark, his name is Glut, although his name is never brought up in the movie, he was originally going to return later in the movie, and Flounder was going to actually defeat him and Flounder would have his moment of glory, finally.
But as we simplified the story, Glut never does return.
When this sequence was first developed, there was Flounder, but Ariel also had another companion, a dolphin, which we called Breaker, but he left very quickly.
We thought that there were too many characters with her along for the ride.
So we gave some of Breaker's personality, which was a very energetic, gung-ho type, we moved that into Ariel, and that actually made her a more lively sort of character, to give her some of the dolphin's personality.
If they would have given us more money, some of these scenes where Scuttle was walking on this rock, would've had more contact shadows, where you'd see his shadow cast on the rock, but that was a concession to the budget and the time restraints that we were under, that we didn't put those things in the film.
I miss them.
Buddy Hackett.
Buddy Hackett.
There was a different voice for Scuttle, originally.
Our boss, Jeffrey Katzenberg, didn't like the other voice we had.
He's like, "Guys, guys, get a comedian.
That's what we did on Oliver." "Richard Mulligan, we got him and the character came alive." "Find a comedian." We went through a list of comedians...
Buddy improvised some here, which we encouraged, I think that was fun.
He also, when we first recorded Buddy, he had written a song for Scuttle.
Have you heard the song that he wrote?
No, but he actually sang it on The Tonight Show.
Yeah, he did sing it on The Tonight Show.
You'll never know what lonely is till you live by yourself on a rock Once we cast Buddy, we wrote it to sound like Buddy, and Buddy was saying, "Don't write for me, write for the part." His very first takes, he was playing Scuttle with an artificial seagull voice that we kind of thought, "This is not the way to go." We wanted him to just be himself and be natural, which he did, and he was great, but there was a little bit of tension just at the very beginning of his first session.
Jason Marin, who did the voice for Flounder, his voice changed by the end of the movie, and we were trying to get Little Jason.
He came in, "Yes, I'm here to do the finishing lines on Flounder." We're like, "Jason, can you just..." He had to cheat it up a little bit.
We like to give characters entrances, and so to give Ursula theatrics, we really wanted her to come out of shadow, even the sort of descent into the camera is all just meant to give her theatrics.
She's a very theatrical character.
The first time we screened this with an audience, and we see that she's an octopus for the first time, there was an audible reaction from the audience, just a little shudder.
And that made it feel like, "Yeah, that's working for her intro." Seriously, 'cause originally, the witch wasn't conceived to be an octopus, she was a different fish, but not octopi, but it really went with the musical approach, in terms of the silky, tentacly, trying to wrap Ariel in and reel her in snakily.
The snake charmer thing in here, I think, worked well with Alan's music.
On the witch, we actually took some live-action footage from a documentary, Disney Mysteries of the Deep, and Roy Disney was very versed and familiar with that, and worked on that and brought that to our attention.
Rob Minkoff, the initial animator of Ursula, did a walk cycle literally on top of that.
So her lower half was this octopus.
We really were able to get real-life observed behavior, combined with the character of this big, overweight, but exaggeratedly graceful vamp, villainess.
And that really became the basis for all her movements later.
Well, it was ruined!
That's all!
Completely destroyed!
This concert was to be the pinnacle...
Ed Gombert was one of the great storyboard artists that worked on the film, and he really came up with the recounting of the tale that Flounder does and the way it was played, and that's really pure Ed Gombert in there.
Probably, you can see it, if you look at a still frame, Flounder actually transforms into Scuttle for a couple of frames there as he's talking about Scuttle, he physically transforms to Scuttle.
But then this seagull came, and it was, "This is this, and that is that..." Most of these bubbles are hand-inked, which is a throwback to the old-school, most of this movie is done with the Xerox process, which is something that was done from 101 Dalmatians forward.
Little Mermaid was actually the last film to use cels and Xerox.
Right, the older films, Snow White and Pinocchio, were hand-inked.
There was actually a person who traced the hand drawings of the animation onto cels.
The Xerox process actually photographed them onto cels.
However, to get the look of those older movies, we really wanted the bubbles to be inked, so, in fact, they were, but as a way of trying to do it on budget, those were actually inked in China.
So, the problem for us was, when the Tiananmen Square incident was happening in China in 1989, it looked like there could be a civil war in China, and we weren't sure we were gonna get our cels back with the bubbles on them.
Our bubbles were trapped in China.
The bubbles were trapped in China.
Tim Engel, who was really overseeing all that, said, "There's a possibility that we may not be seeing any more bubbles." And the movie was under the wire.
We were praying for democracy in China.
But also praying we got our bubbles back.
That was very funny.
Once again, we got our bubbles.
They came.
I don't know about democracy in China, but...
The crab was animated by Duncan Marjoribanks.
I'm always amused whenever I see it, "'cause I think of 6'5" Duncan Marjoribanks animating this teeny little thing.
It's one of the great things about animation, that the animators don't have to look like the characters they portray.
Also, Andreas Deja animated Triton, who, I think, he's always said he based on his father somewhat.
Without the fins, yeah.
A lot of these underwater scenes involve those little patterns of tight there, those are live-action patterns, the way you see light playing under a swimming pool almost, and those were double exposed over the painted backgrounds we drew to give a watery effect.
That's a technique we generally used, as well as filters over the film, to make this all seem like it was happening underwater.
Mark Dindal, the head of effects, who later became the director of The Emperor's New Groove and Chicken Little, he came up with this effect.
It's actually fairly simple and not that expensive to do, but it added a lot to the underwater scenes.
Particularly, in the song, Part of Your World, it gives an extra magic to that, and was used more extensively there.
As you can see, all the refractions of light where the light is hitting the underwater sections.
This pan of the grotto, I think we made this too short.
It moves too fast, I think.
If we had to do this all over again, it would've let you see things just a little bit more.
But it's a nice shot.
If only I could make him understand.
I just don't see things the way he does.
We should mention, in terms of this song, that one of the very early screenings we had for an audience, we brought in a class of school kids into the studio, this sequence was pretty much all black-and-white, it didn't have the effects and everything there, and in the very first screening, the kids squirmed a lot.
That brought up the very controversial thing that there was some talk of either cutting this song or cutting it down, which, pretty much, Howard was horrified at the idea, we were horrified, Alan was horrified, Glen Keane, who was the lead animator on all this and responsible for a lot of it, was horrified.
And even though there was a lot of discussion, it finally came to a point where we could leave it in the way it was for an additional screening now.
And in this second screening, there was more color.
For whatever reason, however, it worked out, they didn't squirm.
They were quiet through the whole number.
Thank God.
You know they almost cut Over the Rainbow from The Wizard of Oz.
And that was one of our arguments with this song.
Howard's contention was every musical needs a point at which its central character, the protagonist, sits down on a garbage pail, on a rock in the sea, and says, "This is what I dream of." And, of course, the rest of the story is all based on creating obstacles that this character has to overcome to achieve their dream.
It sets Ariel's character, it sets her up, what she wants, what she needs, and so much of the rooting interest of the mermaid comes out of this song.
And certainly, I think, we're all very glad this wasn't tampered with, 'cause it's such a signature of the movie.
Also, the earlier lyrics to this song, I might mention, Howard generally resisted changes that we would suggest, and rightfully so, 'cause many of my own personal ideas were stupid, but one that he did actually slightly agree on, his earlier lyrics of this song, he talked about leather in China and things like that.
And we said to Howard, "Well, her information is from this guy" "who doesn't have his story straight, the seagull." So Howard went back and readjusted the lyrics, so he put in the thingamabobs and the whatchamacallits.
Those weren't in the first version of the song. 'Cause he agreed that, yeah, that actually was in character for her, to have these offbeat terms for things.
That painting right there, Glen Keane picked out that painting 'cause he wanted a picture, an image of a fire underwater to go with the lyric.
This shot where Ariel reaches out was the last shot done in the movie.
We wanted to do that on the multi-plane camera, and there were just too many problems and we ended up doing it optically.
At the time, it was technically very difficult, and I think it was shot four or five times and didn't turn out right.
The opticals didn't match right, it had seams...
Her arm would not go outside the hole properly.
And it got to a point that we were running out of time, literally, and we were on a budget and other restrictions, we had one last chance to get that shot to work or we had to use a compromise shot that was a shot that we developed as a last-minute resort, where she didn't reach out beyond the thing.
And the very last time, it worked.
Sebastian's presence as the witness of the song is partly there to mitigate the squirm factor.
He's judgmental about it, and you have that extra dramatic tension.
If it's just being done as a solo in one moment, it becomes a little eggy for an audience, a little bit cloying.
Now, for the students of film, they can see some mistakes here.
Watch this thimble on his foot, sometimes he's got it...
Now, no thimble, it's gone magically.
But now it's back.
Who let that mistake through?
This is your sequence.
It's my sequence, yes.
Ron directed some sequences and I directed some sequences.
And this was Ron's sequence.
It's a nice sequence.
It's a beautiful sequence, I wish I had done it.
We didn't have time to redo everything on this.
We were aware of a lot of the mistakes.
But there were severe budget and time restrictions, in terms of making this film, so we had to pick our spots carefully, in terms of what we could fix and what we had to leave.
Dorse Lanpher, great effects animator, did the fireworks in that shot.
It really helped.
Thom Enriquez was the storyboard artist that story-boarded this sequence.
Beautiful draftsmanship.
Our story team on the film overall was really an amazing story team, many of which have gone on to be directors, art directors, production designers...
In this scene, we see several of the staff, including the guy dancing, Rasoul Azadani, who was a layout artist on that, and who we've worked with pretty much in all the movies that we've done.
This dog, Max, we added, didn't really exist in the fairytale, but we wanted to give the Prince a companion to bounce off of.
He was colored gray, he was a big Sheepdog.
We did have a nightmare with the paint of this character, because a lot of times, that gray would just crawl on film.
You can still see it, here and there, it's a tough color to make work.
Mark Henn animated these scenes of Ariel as she came up over the side, and I think he really did a great job of capturing her innocence and just her wide-eyedness at this whole new world that she's looking at, the Prince in particular.
This is really the heart of the story here, obviously, her falling in love with the Prince.
This is one of the pieces of music that I wrote first as a source piece for you to animate to.
Right.
I know you talked about Grieg.
Although, I don't really know Grieg.
Yeah, it's sort of a little bit of Hall of the Mountain King.
And Grieg was Danish, so it all made sense somehow.
One of the more difficult characters in this film was Prince Eric, and there's a tradition of Disney princes, that they hadn't worked very well.
In Cinderella, I talked to Eric Larson, who animated on it, he said, "Yeah, he was stiff, I didn't really get it right." Animating the prince has been called the most thankless job in animation, because it's probably harder to do than any other character...
Even in the Andersen fairytale, you don't get much of a sense of the Prince, as much as you do of the Little Mermaid, and that's a challenge.
The more realistic human characters are always the most difficult, but, still, a character like Ariel is still more fun.
Particularly, Ariel was a great heroine.
She at least had the extra aspect that she was part fish, and she could swim underwater and she can move in ways that humans couldn't possibly move, and that's why his screen time tends to be more limited too, because it's just difficult.
We had Matt O'Callaghan who animated the Prince, Mike Cedeno.
Christopher Barnes did the voice on the Prince, and I think he did a really nice job of trying to get an engaging, likeable guy.
The storm sequence coming up was actually one of the first sequences done on the movie, along with the Under the Sea sequence and the Louis sequence, those were actually the first things that we actually started animation on.
Because it was almost like a musical sequence, in that it was so rich in production value, if we didn't do it early, we knew that we might not get it done, 'cause it would take longer and there'd be impulses to simplify it and cut it, and we'd be under the gun, so we knew it would be difficult, so the sooner we could get to it, the better.
We called them "money shots." Which, I guess, means that we're gonna spend extra money on them.
It was also because it was an action sequence, there were just so many aspects of it that could be done earlier on, whereas sequences that were primarily character-driven, we almost wanted to save until the animators had a little more time with the characters.
This sequence certainly is a tour de force of effects animation, the fact that it was done first really gave us a chance to go all out.
And Mark Dindal, who was the head of effects on the movie, did a great job on this sequence.
The gray-green cast of the skies in all this was inspired by an N.C.
Wyeth painting he had done, I think it's from Kidnapped, or one of these, where there's a shipwrecked figure in the foreground and a ship in the background.
And that was the inspiration for the visual look of this sequence.
I never had a successful solution for this scene, I directed this sequence, and I wanted to be able to see the statue before it sank, so we cheated, so the statue was floating for a minute.
It's a marble statue, it made no sense whatsoever, but I couldn't figure it out. "How do we show that before it goes away?" So, it was bizarre, but there it is.
The water animation is beautifully done.
And water is very difficult to animate convincingly, and Ted Kierscey did a lot of it, and a lot of the animators.
It's funny, when you score a sequence like this, every hit becomes a source of stress for you.
Leading up to the session, you want to make sure each hit is gonna work, so they're all imprinted indelibly on my brain.
I like that jazzy horn figure for the action when he's running across the ship.
I think that was cool.
I remember this was very early scoring for me.
I should point out that the orchestrations were done by Thomas Pasatieri.
He was a great help to me in learning the art of scoring.
Animation was not, at that point, hip.
I remember a film composer, it was difficult, I was asking his advice, "and he said," Look, man, "nobody takes a score from an animated film seriously." He said, "Just take a powder." -He just meant like...
Phone it in.
You think about how that must've turned on its ear within five years.
And now we're into the reprise of Part of Your World.
Here's a rare interview that Howard and I did at the time of the release of the film.
Alan writes great ballads, I think that's one of Alan's real gifts, is Alan can bring a tear to your eye pretty quick.
And ballads are really, really hard in a musical for the whole family, because kids aren't famous for liking love songs.
So it's hard to write a song that moves, and has a little bit of rhythm, and also tugs at your heartstrings and is a soft number.
And the challenge of this number was to do a ballad that also moved the plot forward, which is why the subject matter of being part of your world was so important.
What is she realty longing for?
What is going to not just stop the action but keep everything moving?
This is John here.
Howard's lyrics on this, again, the original version was slightly different, in that Howard played the lyric of this as, kind of, that she was disappointed, and the original lyric on this was, "I'll never be part of that world." And she was sad as she dove into the water.
I remember we talked with Howard about it and said, just because of the shape of the story, she's gonna be kind of moony about the Prince and feeling up about it.
We said we thought, actually, it would be better to play this as an up thing.
And Howard, again, that was the only other thing we ever talked Howard into, and he agreed and he revised the lyrics so that it was much more of a positive statement than a statement of regret or sadness.
Howard did mention to us early on there was an element of this that was like a handicapped girl wanting to walk.
And I think that's what he drew on for the lyrics of the song, partly.
Actually, the song itself should be titled Part of that World.
And this is Part of Your World. -They've both taken on one title.
Yeah, that's true.
Glen Keane animated much of Ariel in this part, a great animator, and he did this scene where she's on the rock, and I remember we shot this with Sherri Stoner, but Glen acted out this scene for her.
And Glen is a burly, football-player-looking kind of a guy, and there he was, he's doing this action of just tentatively coming up over the rock, and I still remember Glen's physical performance, it had all the sensitivity that you see here in his drawn version, but picture a muscular Gene Kelly kind of a guy doing this.
Here it is, a moment of determination.
Every teenage girl's desire to be free of her parents.
It's a major story moment.
Everything up to that point is really set-up.
Now the situation is really clear that we've got a mermaid who is in conflict with her father, who wants something that is forbidden in her world and will do whatever it takes to get it.
Her daddy will love that.
King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl...
I might mention Kathy Zielinski animated the witch in this sequence.
And there aren't a ton of women animators, but she's one of the best animators, period.
But she did a great job with the witch there.
Those fish in that opening shot were computer fish, which we thought we might use more of in the movie, but at this point, the computer animation was not quite at a point where we were totally happy with it.
So we used the computer fish to a minimum, but they were in that one shot.
And I do believe that this scene of Ariel was the first scene of Ariel animated in the entire movie.
Mark Henn animated this scene.
In the story reels, we had a longer version, and there were fish doing their hair and there were various things with the sisters that we took out.
Howard and I were both huge fans of the earlier animated features.
He felt that as the musical updated itself, the animated musical would also update itself.
For us, Little Mermaid was the follow-up to Little Shop of Horrors.
As different as they are, it really was.
And there are people who joke and call Part of Your World, "Somewhere That's Wet." I haven't heard that. -The other thing I want to say about...
That's funny.
That's a joke on Somewhere That's Green.
And so, we did a pastiche of '50s and '60s rock and roll, Little Mermaid, we did really our own pastiche of Disney.
When we started working on Sebastian, first you guys had Sebastian as a stuffy English...
Clarence the crab.
Clarence the crab.
Reggae was very hip and Howard said, "Let's make him a Jamaican crab" "or a Caribbean crab.
Calypso." I think of Harry Belafonte, that kind of warmth.
And so here are some thoughts from an earlier interview with myself and Howard Ashman.
It's very hard to write contemporary sounding music in a fairytale context.
You're dealing with long ago and far away.
And you really still want to have a feeling that modern kids and adults can enjoy and start to move to, because that's how you get energy.
And it was sort of a trick.
When I talked to John and Ron before the script was actually written, we had a long conference about that.
Was there a way we could give the crab something in his personality that would make it possible to have a special kind of music that had some kind of rhythmic edge or contemporary feeling to it?
And what we came up with was that there would be a Jamaican flavor to what he did in the music.
And that was to get energy, to get a little bit of a pop feeling, and yet to have it be true to its fairytale roots.
This song you guys finished in Burbank.
We started out actually at my farm in Pennsylvania, and Howard said he always wanted a figure that just circled back on itself.
That didn't end, so the song really started with the figure.
And one of the things I always talk about is in the world of animation, they're so specific in their references, and you guys especially, so as we made all these references, they animated the references.
And then when we went back to scoring, you guys wanted every one of these things that you had animated caught with different orchestral colors.
So you'll notice where there's all these different sea creatures, every single one is caught with a very specific scoring reference.
And I remember when we were working on this, Alan was right next to us, and Robby Merkin, who was doing the arrangements was right down the hall.
So they would go back and forth with the storyboard artists and with us and be seeing hits that we were suggesting or a different fish they could use.
And they'd come back, "Which one was this again, that was doing this part?" It was the overdub session of all time.
That's all I can say.
Overdub means after you've recorded the basic track, then you add other parts.
We did have to fight a bit with Jeffrey on this, in that we wanted to use colors as the song got progressively more joyous and that the color changed to these oranges and these reds.
And Jeffrey had a hard time.
He's like, "Underwater is blue, guys." And so we had to convince him it's okay.
So in some scenes, we had to sneak a little blue in the corners to keep Jeffrey happy, but eventually, he went along with it.
We felt the mood of the song, no one's gonna worry that it's not blue anymore.
It's hot.
Howard recorded the demo vocal on this one and he was just...
A lot of the jokiness of Sam's reading.
Sam did a great job, but Howard, his original demo was full of spice.
Howard's vocals were definitely the blueprint for the final result.
I think Sam's rendition of this song was one of the big things, in terms of getting cast for the role, because we heard a lot of actors sing that song and a lot of them were very good, and certainly Howard set the tone for it.
But I think Sam just did an incredible job with this song.
The interesting thing about Sam.
Howard auditioned him in New York.
And we cast him never having met Sam, but we heard a tape of Sam.
And he was so great just on the tape that we said, "That's the guy to do it." And then we really met Sam the first time when he came in to record it.
We had never really met him before at all.
The song that changed the Academy Awards.
Alan won Oscars continuously...
I think there were eight, but who's counting?
Every Academy Award that Alan was involved in, he would win multiple Oscars. -Usually score and song.
Don't they come in pairs?
Then at a certain point, the Academy changed the awards so that musical scores would be a separate category.
We always looked at that, that that was the Alan Menken adjustment or whatever.
But Alan was winning so many awards, and everyone else felt left out, so they had to change the awards so that other people would have a chance.
Remember, I showed up for the Academy Awards, and they had me seated on the aisle, which I guess said something, because prior to that, I had been sitting in the middle of the aisle where I could never escape.
And I said to my friend, Dean Pitchford, who wrote Fame and Footloose, I said, "I don't know, what do you think's going to happen?" He says, "I don't know who's gonna win the Oscar, "but I looked backstage" "and the Academy Award had scales on it." This sequence was very early in production, Ron directed this sequence.
This was the first stuff done on the crab, it seemed like...
Yeah, it was the first animation done on the crab.
Duncan Marjoribanks did the crab in this and Andreas Deja did Triton.
And Ed Gombert story-boarded this and it's pretty much...
The water is just fantastic to look at there.
But this was a little sample of the movie in a way that went first and as I say, Ed Gombert story-boarded it, and it pretty much is exactly the way he story-boarded it.
And it is just a nice little bit between the two of them that we were very happy with the way it turned out.
And it gave a nice sense of setting those two characters.
But it's not a complicated scene from a directorial standpoint, except from the acting standpoint that it's realty getting a certain kind of dynamic in contrast.
It certainly is fun with the huge, imposing character, like the sea king and the little teeny character like the crab just kind of carrying on everyday conversation like they're not conscious at all of their size difference.
We always thought Ariel's grotto was like a teenage girl's bedroom, and she's got her poster of a rock star who was the Prince.
And that was the person that she was infatuated with.
And we were trying to draw the analogy with modern teenagers and their trouble with their fathers, obviously.
Overprotective parents and kids that don't want to have to be tied down by their parents.
If you notice, the statue gets madder and madder as the sequence progresses. -Is that right?
His expression just keeps getting...
Was that an accident or was that deliberate?
Not just the King, but the statue gets madder, too.
I never noticed that.
But, Dad, I...
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
The father-daughter relationship in this movie I find to be one of the most emotional.
Possibly because I've had two teenage daughters and seen them grow up.
Yeah, my daughter was born as we were making this, and now she's more this age, so I've seen it from both ends.
We got a lot of letters in terms of this movie.
And there's fan letters from people who liked the movie.
But I'd say we got more serious letters from fathers and daughters and things that they were emotionally involved in.
In some cases, at least with one father in particular, that this kind of brought about a reconciliation with his daughter who he was estranged by.
And that was nice to get letters like that.
The only thing I find difficult is the idea that she's Triton's favorite daughter.
The idea of having a favorite daughter seems...
It's contrary to someone who's got more than one daughter.
Our theory was that she's the most like him, and that that in effect was what created the conflict.
To the extent that we said when Triton was a younger man, he had red hair.
That they clashed because they're both strong willed and individualistic.
The children's book illustrator, Chris Van Allsburg, did some drawings for us when we were trying to develop the look of the film, and he did one of Triton's palace with greens and golds, and he also did a study of the moonlit grotto that was one of the earliest visual representations of Ariel's grotto.
Paddi Edwards did the voice of Flotsam and Jetsam, and this voice was treated a bit, but really, Paddi did have a very distinctive, raspy, great, unique voice that we thought was perfect for these two.
And they're animated by Shawn Keller, who's a quirky, nice guy, but got a lot of sinister mileage out of these guys.
What's very effective about them is the idea that they trade off their lines in a totally seamless way.
But there is something.
Howard was extremely specific about what he wanted.
It was always a big concession for Howard to have me play any role, 'cause he frankly would like to have played every role.
It carried over with the actors when Jodi was performing the number, Howard had so many specific things in his head and Jodi contributed a lot, but Howard had phrasing ideas and things that really were wrapped into his approach to it.
And Pat Carroll, really, he helped steer her through it.
Certain songs more than others.
But the phrasing just was very, very specific.
I know a few people who could have written Ursula, but nobody at the level of the way Howard wrote her.
Howard had said that one of the things he always wanted to do was run a children's theater.
So you combine that with that West Broadway or West Village sensibility and you get a sense of who the man was.
Tremendously emotional person and also so hip and so cutting edge, as far as the zeitgeist of our culture.
And certainly here, it's in Ursula, but I remember Howard said our assignment was to write a score for an animated musical that could sit on the shelf alongside Cinderella and Dumbo and Peter Pan and Pinocchio and, of course, Snow White.
That's what he always said.
Right.
No!
No!
She's a demon.
She's a monster.
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.
That was Ron's line, "Why don't you tell my father?
You're good at that." And I've always liked that line just because it's so teenage girlish. -Well, it was John's line.
Believable. "Teenagers, they think they know everything." "You give them an inch and they swim all over you." This exterior, the witch's place, Mike Peraza, who is our art director, did that really cool layout of that sea creature and her actual shell, he designed that as well, and I always thought it was kind of Georgia O'Keeffe-esque.
Those out-of-focus, dangling tendrils in the foreground, that was actually shot on a multi-plane camera.
The one done off the lot at Disney, 'cause the only one we could find that was up and working was actually done by a cameraman that Mark Dindal knew who shot stuff for Filmation.
So that's one of two or three multi-plane shots in the movie.
A few of these first scenes of the witch were animated by Rob Minkoff, but then he left to do other things, and Ruben Aquino really did 98% of the witch and most of this song coming up, and this animation here is Ruben's animation.
And he did a beautiful job, in terms of just getting her personality, as well as just the technical issue of keeping all these tentacles alive and moving, and I loved what he did.
Of course, Rob had also done an early exploratory drawing that Howard had really liked and we had really liked of the witch, where Howard said, "This is great, she looks like a Miami Beach matron." And we got into a whole thing about Divine.
Divine is a cross-dressing guy, George was...
What was his real name? -His real name was Glen, but...
Glen, okay, yeah.
Everyone knows Divine as Divine.
People also know Divine, of course, as the original Edna Turnblad from the hit movie, Hairspray.
He was from Baltimore, where Howard was from, I think.
And so, some of the early development art that Rob was doing and others were doing was really trying to get some of Divine's big, campy, overweight diva, get that into the witch.
And so there are still vestiges of it in the witch, although at one point, the witch even had a mohawk à la Pink Flamingos -and all that.
Also Divine.
Also, Divine played that character, and Jeffrey thought that was a little too extreme.
I don't think Jeffrey was aware that we were relating it to Divine, he just looked at us and he's like, "Guys, it's 10% too much." I think he was right on that, as I remember, it was pretty extreme.
Just want to point out the voice of Pat Carroll.
We knew Pat Carroll from the Danny Thomas show.
And we really had a hard time casting the witch, because Howard had done so great with the demos.
It was hard to find anybody that could match Howard.
And then Pat Carroll came in and she really did a great job.
Nailed it.
I know.
She always talked about how it was a cross between Tallulah Bankhead and Maurice Evans, Shakespearean thing in this vampy, throaty Southern belle or something.
And that's what she got in the performance.
But on the whole I've been a saint To those poor unfortunate souls Now, here's the deal.
I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days.
Actually, this song was done in two separate sessions.
We did it, and then we went back and did it again -just to get all the nuances.
Right.
I think Jeffrey was pushing for that.
She did a fantastic job.
Gary Trousdale story-boarded this sequence.
And he really tried to visualize all this deal making.
And I thought he did a great job of really making it visual, so that we'd understand, even without the soundtrack, what's at stake here.
Some thoughts from Howard Ashman again.
We wanted to make songs that would tell the story, songs that would really move the story forward, really push the plot along and keep things driving ahead.
So, it's not like you stop and sing a song.
To my mind, this recalls what it feels like to write a successful musical for the stage.
We were there at the genesis, and we saw it through every step of the way with our collaborators.
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
We perform when we write.
You have to.
Howard is the actor.
Pat Carroll is wonderful, but you haven't heard the witch's number until you've heard Howard perform it.
And you never should.
It's wonderful.
I generally get to play things like Ariel.
Just 'cause you're shorter.
Everybody would rather write for Captain Hook than for Peter Pan.
They're just more fun.
I don't know why.
And Ursula's an especially fun villain, not only 'cause she looks like an octopus, you have that great movement with her lower regions.
But she's also very sophisticated as a character.
She's much more verbal.
Then as a lyricist, that was fun for me, because I got to make more rhymes and more puns and more sophisticated humor with her.
I see her song as a comedy number, first of all, and a character number.
And then, third, talk about things that are driving the plot forward.
At the beginning of that song, Ariel doesn't even know who Ursula is practically.
And by the end of that song, she's a human.
So, a whole lot changes in that little three-minute sequence.
I think we are thinking of something almost Kurt Weill-ish from The Threepenny Opera, for the basic feel of that number.
And it's very seductive and Ursula's very seductive.
And she's seducing Ariel into making this deal.
I remember when we did this, Howard talked about the shape of this number, and I'd never really heard that term used, as far as music went.
But he was talking about how, in terms of this last thing with the spell, that it almost was like a three-act play in itself or something.
Well, it's a big musical scene.
You have the basic body of the song.
You break for the dialogue when she's outlining the terms of the contract.
Then she comes back in full on the end of the song, -and then we transfer into the spell.
The spell section.
One thing we haven't talked about, which is so great about you and Howard and the songs that you did, is the storytelling aspect.
There are a lot of bad musicals, where sometimes you cut the songs out and sometimes it seems better.
And the songs are so much a part of just telling this story.
They're integral to the story and they advance things.
We have to be good thieves.
We always have to take from your script, and sometimes take the best aspects and incorporate it into our songs, and cover as much of the plot as we possibly can.
This shot, I might mention, we always thought of it as our Sports Illustrated shot.
But it was this backlit thing and a girl in the water, like a shampoo commercial or something.
There was something picturesque we wanted to do about it.
In the Andersen story, when the mermaid walks, she left bloody footprints and all.
We didn't really want to do that, but we did want to make this transition where she got her legs feel a little bit painful, in an homage almost to the Andersen thing.
That exterior of the palace, Rowland Wilson designed...
He is a great draftsman.
He designed the Prince's palace.
He did a drawing that we loved that combined these Mediterranean elements.
It made it a palace unlike any other Disney fairytale palace.
And with the whitewashed stucco, it was really going for a warm Southern Mediterranean feel that he thought would be attractive to a mermaid who had been stuck all her life in the cold ocean.
We had a challenge here to stage this, because technically, in between those legs and that upper body, she's really not wearing any clothes.
So, we had to get her dressed and yet keep it discreet.
So, it was staged in a way where she was underwater in this sequence.
That helped us.
There's such a feeling to this movie in scenes like this that is just infused with this fantastic innocence.
And it always makes you feel just wonderful.
I got it.
It's your hairdo, right?
You've been usin' the dinglehopper, right?
No?
No, huh?
Well, let me see.
New seashells?
This scene right here, where the crab goes through this slight nervous breakdown, and then comes through and decides he's actually going to help Ariel, actually Howard wrote that. -That was added.
Wrote the dialogue for that.
We had the basis of the scene, but we were struggling.
And actually, Michael Eisner had felt that the crab needed a real turning point here.
And we were really knee-deep in stuff and a little bit burned out.
Howard wrote this scene, and it's a beautiful scene. -Is that right?
Yeah, he did.
In terms of where the crab comes around and says, "You're going to be miserable for the rest of your life." This is Howard's dialogue here.
Because Michael Eisner felt like his change from being against Ariel to being her ally in this happened offstage in our earlier version that we showed him, and he said, "Unless you show that onstage, people aren't going to understand." I think it was a good point.
He was right.
And Howard did a great job of comically putting this over.
When he goes from, "I'm not going to help you.
This is the worst thing ever." To, "Okay, I'll help you." And he did a great job.
Howard, of course, as a book writer on our musicals, he was an executive producer on this and on Beauty and the Beast.
Actually, he moved out here and was living out here.
But what a resource to have that kind of person offstage, so to speak.
It says, "Additional dialogue by Howard Ashman," if you watch the end credits.
There were two or three scenes where he did rewrite some of the dialogue.
And this was the key one, really.
We weren't sure when he came in, in terms of how that might work, and he didn't write for a while aside from the songs.
He held back.
Not that we would have had a problem with it.
For whatever reason, he held back for a while.
And he was involved with our writing and would make suggestions and would make things.
But he didn't write himself until this point.
And then Howard stepped in and wrote this, wrote two or three other bits that are all really memorable, great little moments in the movie.
I never knew that.
I'd love to know where they are.
We'll tell you as we're going through.
We were really going for a watercolor look with these backgrounds, where you see the highlights really almost showing through the paper, that was really a throwback to a Pinocchio painting style and that kind of a thing, in terms of the way this looks.
Glen Keane animated Ariel in this section.
We did use live-action reference for both Ariel and Eric to help the animators to get a jumping off point.
Sherri Stoner was an actress, a great improv comedian, and just brought a lot of spark to it and helped to inspire Glen Keane.
The combination really worked into some very nice acting.
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?
We have met.
I knew it.
You're the one, the one I've been looking for.
Glen animated this scene here, where she's trying to do her pantomime thing 'cause she can't speak.
And how can she put over what she did?
And it's just a tour de force.
Animation is great when you have to rely on pantomime to really put over the ideas.
Certainly, early on in this movie, there was a lot of controversy over the idea that our leading character would not speak for a big portion of the movie.
And certainly in story reels, it was a problem, because she seemed to disappear a lot in the scenes where she didn't speak.
But we were kind of saying when she's animated, when the acting is there, it will be different.
And Glen Keane and Mark Henn, who did a lot of this material where she doesn't speak.
I think that was the case.
Once the animation got in, she was alive and she kept alive.
And it's a tribute to the art of animation, but that's animation acting at its best.
Pantomime can be a tough sell, as we found out with the carpet in Aladdin, similar idea that...
You have to say "Trust us" a lot. "Trust us.
It will work." One of the things that I guess also helps keep her alive without her voice is that music plays a role. -Yeah, absolutely.
It was key.
The underscore becomes basically her voice.
It does become her voice.
Yeah.
This sequence in the earlier version of the film, as we were working on it, had been longer, and it was felt that this needed to be paced up a little bit.
So, this whole section was trimmed down a little bit.
These washerwomen had a longer rant that they talked about.
All this got compressed and turned into one little set piece of mistreatment of the crab.
There's also a bit with Max the dog chasing the crab around the castle, that got cut.
We had trouble with that shot.
Making it read, I think.
We did it four or five times.
Yeah.
Just wasn't clear that those were stuffed crabs or something.
Just something about it wasn't so clear.
Here, again, for all you continuity fans, you can watch the knives and forks jump around on the sides of the plate.
And one scene they're there, one scene they're not.
You got a napkin, you got no napkin.
I don't know how we let all that through, but we did.
This is one of my favorite scenes where she walks into the tight.
Mark Henn animated it.
Just the staging of it and the layout, Dave Dunnet is our head of layout, I don't know if that was Dave's layout, but it's one of my favorite scenes.
We always called this the Cinderella scene.
She's coming out in her magic dress and everything.
Let me help you, my dear.
There we go.
That's better.
See, now, she had a napkin in that last scene and no napkin now.
No plate, either.
Grimsby is Ben Wright, who is a great character actor.
And we cast him.
We loved what he did in the reading, we cast him based on that, not realizing that he was actually the voice of Roger in 101 Dalmatians, and that he also did a voice in Jungle Book.
But we didn't know that when we cast him.
Yeah.
Carlotta's voice is Edie McClurg, who's a great comic actress who's done a lot of work in film and television, and was on Pee-wee's Playhouse and various things, but a wonderful comedian.
I know we tested a fair amount of actors for Louis.
And there again, whenever Howard's done the demo, you feel like you got to find somebody that is at least where Howard is at and hopefully can bring something more to it.
And that's not easy.
I knew René Auberjonois more as a dramatic actor, and I didn't know him so much doing comedy, but when he came in and read for the part and did this song, he really brought a lot of comedy to it.
Of course, in different countries, they dub Louis differently.
So, in France, I think he becomes an Italian chef. -Is that right?
Yeah.
That's right.
It's always somebody else.
You look at Chef Louis and you go, "Would we get away with a song in an animated now" "in which basically one of our characters" "is literally describing how you're going to kill?" -Right.
They're tight.
And all the imagery, knives and axes and all that.
We loved it.
And we did it as was constructed.
But now, I think they would give us a hard time.
Well, because people overthink things.
Les Poissons is a very slight song.
It's very French musical.
It's very deliberately in that style.
And it's mostly a comedy song.
And this song as a song is a fairly compact, short song, which really completes itself with the chase sequence at the end.
Originally, this was a longer thing, too.
Howard had a whole, "Class, do this and class, do this." It was just a little too long, so we had to tighten it up a bit.
Gary Trousdale story-boarded it.
Don Martin, Mad Magazine sort of drawing.
Like many other sequences, I remember it was a lot of trial and error for the chase, for the music we used and the length of it.
And it also had the demo love aspect in that I really did not want to use the cancan, Offenbach...
I really wanted to use...
And for whatever reason...
Did we give you a hard time about that?
I don't remember.
I just finally said, you know what, somehow the cancan, it really worked better for all of us.
And I just went, "Okay." And I think I may have played with it, and in the end we said, "You know what," "we're trying to reinvent the wheel.
Let's just go with the wheel." And the association of the original cancan, which everyone knew, was so strong.
It was a question in a Disney film how far you can go.
And I think Howard found which was right.
Had he gone a little further than this, it might've been too far, but I think it really works well. -Cruelty can be very funny.
Yes.
And his sense of humor, of course, was...
He loved to beat up his characters and just make merciless fun of them.
Howard was so smart and had such a tough sensibility. -He was caustic.
Caustic, I think, is the word.
Alan did something on this movie that we haven't done in any other movie.
And he actually wrote, in effect, the silent film score, where he on a solo piano recorded a bunch of themes that we then put against the action.
Again, many of which Alan recorded without having seen the action.
There were ideas of sketches of tones and things like that.
And we fitted to that in cases.
Occasionally, it seems to me, he did it live.
That is, you're just watching the picture and doing music, reacting to the picture and...
There were times where we got so used to Alan's solo piano underscore that even when we heard the whole orchestra, there were a few spots where I missed the solo piano, and I actually said to the orchestra a little bit, I wasn't sure, "What if we just left those in as solo piano?" I was thinking specifically of the scene where Ariel is brushing her hair, and she's out on the balcony at night and there was a beautiful theme.
It still is, the music that's there, but it was just the solo piano that had a wistfulness or something, so we got used to those things. -Well, it's called demo love.
Yeah, right.
Yes, we've had a lot of that, unfortunately.
It's very tough when you get very used to things that are temporary, but they're there for maybe three years before they get replaced.
And this was another scene that Howard rewrote our dialogue on. -Is that right?
Yeah. "Just pucker up your lips." These are Howard's dialogue.
We talked about her bedroom, the design of it.
Howard mentioned, "I think it should be very Laura Ashley." And so, that was one of the things we were going for when we designed her bedroom.
And the lighting on this was really nice.
There again, we had to pick our spots, but this has a nice -warm feeling to it. "You are hopeless, child." And Duncan Marjoribanks did the pucker up scene.
That's a beautiful scene of Sebastian.
John directed that sequence, but the little bedroom scene is one of my favorite scenes in the movie.
You are hopeless, child.
You know that?
Disney had gotten away from those kinds of lyrical scores that go along with the visuals and accent the visuals.
You really brought that back, I think, which was good and we wanted that.
I think people think just because something is retro, going back to the '30s and '40s, that the reference will mean nothing because our audience are kids.
And they don't realize how much in the subconscious of our culture can be accessed by artists.
It's not just whatever is contemporary.
There's a lot that's timeless in this.
We wanted to keep the King alive and the story of the lonely King, where's his daughter at, 'cause the father-daughter story was so strong.
Occasionally in these films, I get to write standalone pieces of music.
The Tour of the Kingdom is one of them.
Yeah, I love what Alan did on this.
Again, we had a piano track version of this that we were animating to, originally.
That was a very simple thing.
You don't often get to, as a composer, write a continuous piece of music that lasts more than about 15 seconds.
And I loved that Penny Lane horn in there. -That was neat.
That was very cool, I thought.
Brenda Chapman story-boarded this sequence, and we struggled with this goofy puppet show, trying to make it read and yet be quick and funny. -Probably a little too quick.
Yeah, too quick, probably.
Here are some thoughts from an earlier interview with myself and Howard Ashman.
When I had been offered the opportunity to write the underscore for the entire picture, I was looking for, "How do you do this?" And there's nobody around who does this anymore, really, this kind of underscore.
In a sense, you're choreographing like you would a ballet.
You're choreographing the movie.
Therefore, you're pulling from traditions that haven't been putted from in years, in terms of underscore.
In the old days, a lot of the music was written first before they animated a thing.
Just even the background music was written first.
And in some ways, we've gone back to some parts of that old tradition in deciding the songs as the story itself is getting developed.
So there are lots of places where they have animated right to the music.
If there's a little...
They've animated to that.
That... was in the little demo recording that we made.
And it's been there for three years.
And finally it becomes a little dance step.
It's amazing to see.
Now we come up to Kiss the Girl.
If there was gonna be a single, it was gonna be Kiss the Girl.
But that never really developed.
When we wrote our original treatment, we had a little sequence, and Howard said, "I think there could be a serenade." And so that evolved into this, Kiss the Girl.
And the stakes in that song, they really help give a dramatic tension to this.
And it has a plot point.
We could never get Howard to just say, "I'm going to write a song for the pop market," until Beauty and the Beast.
We basically took the rock riff...
Which is the standard riff you'd think of, in terms of Phil Spector or Billy Joel, and just turned it on its ear in a little bit of a Caribbean way with a...
And just built up through all the animals into the various sounds, into a full arrangement.
Those reeds that are coming up are reused from The Old Mill.
The old 1937 Silly Symphony.
We try not to steal things from other movies too often.
Unless they're great.
We all steal what we have to.
I actually did a little corrected animation on that one scene of Ariel, just sort of looking over.
Somebody adjusted the timing, so one of the few scenes I quasi had something to do with animating in the movie.
It's strange, but I did.
Howard Ashman again.
Kiss the Girl has a little bit of a Caribbean or maybe even a little Latin feeling to it, and I'm a doo-wop person, so it's got just a little bit of...
Thrown in there for spice and for fun.
Sing with me now.
It's a good time to talk about the voice of Jodi Benson, which we hear as the voice of Ariel and then it becomes the entire emotional impetus for Eric.
Jodi is somebody who had worked with Howard in Smile.
And I had known Jodi for years in New York.
Very talented actress, singer, dancer, the whole deal.
We had auditions here in L.A., we had auditions in New York that Howard supervised.
And we heard her audition, not having been there, present at the audition, but she did such a great job.
In most of the auditions, people would come in and sing Over the Rainbow or something like that.
And then on call backs, I think they did Part of Your World.
But I think Jodi was very comfortable with doing those slips between speaking some lines, singing some lines.
There's a very real quality in Jodi's voice and she has the classic Menken voice, which I really like, someone who can give you a good Broadway belt but then mix into a soprano.
One of the things we did totally differently than any other picture was we went directly from our demos and we had all of the vocal performances done to synthesizers.
And then we wiped away the synth tracks and recorded orchestral parts -to replace them.
Which was the wrong way to do it.
Occasionally, we got into some trouble on that. 'Cause the mistake that we made was, we animated to those tracks.
Unfortunately then, those tracks all had to be replaced at the end, and they had to hit all these musical accents.
So it made a nightmare for the musicians at the end of the line, trying to hit these on-stage musical hits that we had animated to.
It was a slight nightmare when we were recording.
But they were great synth tracks.
And it gave the studio the comfort to move forward with the project without having to spend a fortune up front.
Disney animation is always done in the warm-cool thing here, where you play off warm things against cool.
So the little fireflies against the blue background.
I just like that play of color.
And it's our homage to Pirates of the Caribbean or something. -Really?
Yeah.
We had originally written a longer scene between the Prince and Ariel, hadn't we, at the end of that, that we wound up doing away with...
There was a whole scene that was gone.
Where the Prince talked about his conflict, of he likes her, but there's this other girl that he's heard her voice, and rubbing it in a little bit, it was a Hans Christian Andersen-y scene.
But we certainly had to cut things down a lot, in terms of the story, it got simpler as it went along and essentially, that didn't seem like it was necessary, that you got the Prince's conflict without him having to articulate it.
So we took that whole scene out before we ever animated it.
This idea coming up wasn't in the Andersen fairytale.
The Prince was getting married to another girl, but it wasn't the witch.
The witch was more prominent in our thing, in the idea of the witch actually using her voice and transforming into something to thwart Ariel from winning the Prince's heart.
That was an idea that we added to the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale.
Also one of the things that surprised me in our early screenings was that scene when the Prince looks in the window and you see Ariel combing her hair with a fork.
It got a strong reaction, and it's something that you'd almost take for granted as you're working on the movie, and the fact that people really responded seemed to indicate like they were getting something here, they were really into that.
Howard again.
It's just amazing the way the animators enrich and bring to life and cause something inanimate to act.
It's like having the greatest actors in the world performing your material.
And it's just what we had in mind.
And it is what we conceived, in terms of tone and in terms of content.
There's just something about the Disney fairytale cartoons, going all the way back to Snow White and then to Pinocchio.
I grew up on Pinocchio and Peter Pan.
And the idea of doing one of those, it's like there's all these library books on the shelf.
There's Snow White and there's Sleeping Beauty and there's Cinderella, there's Peter Pan, there's Pinocchio, and to try to make something that fits comfortably on the shelf with those, what a difficult thing to do, but what a great thing to try to do.
It's a humbling experience, I'll tell you.
But to try to do something that could actually be comfortable in that line of titles is pretty amazing.
I think it does give you latitude to work in all kinds of musical styles and just to dream.
And this is one of early CGI, computer-animated steps, was still the infancy of computer animation, but we used it.
It generated a 2D drawing that then was painted, but the actual stairs were built in the computer and then painted by hand based on the drawings generated from that.
Congratulations, my dear.
Patty Disney, the wife of Roy Disney, I remember her talking after the preview.
Where this scene coming up is one of Patty Disney's favorite scenes.
Where she's hearing the news, and she does this little thing with her hands, and she's just kind of disturbed, and she always singled this out -as one of her favorite scenes.
That's Mark Henn.
And Renee Holt, I think, did the cleanup on this.
The cleanup on the movie Vera Lanpher supervised, and the cleanup staff did a great job.
Yeah, and the cleanup animation is...
The animators actually work rough and there are other artists that clean up their work.
They take the scribbler drawings and make them tighter and more precise for painting later.
In this case, we used black Xerox for the characters, but we wanted a delicacy to it, so people actually used a mechanical pencil to give a very fine line, which almost gave an ink look, in the sense that the lines were thin enough, they would pick up some of the color around it.
And it gave a delicacy to it.
It was hard to do.
But they did a great job on the cleanup.
Roy Disney's involvement in the film, certainly Roy had a nautical background, he was a yachtsman, he loved the sea, so there were various points in terms of terminology, he changed some of our dialogue to reflect the truer nauticalisms.
I think he changed something we had to "a following sea." I still don't know what a following sea is, but we used that line based on Roy's suggestion.
I think Jodi enjoyed also playing this sort of villainous character when Ursula has gained Jodi's voice, so to speak.
She was sick of being sweet.
Gave her a little angle to play with.
The sea witch!
Oh, no!
She's gonna...
I gotta...
We first started to record the actors in 1987, and some of the recording continued till 1989.
So it was about a two-year period from beginning to end, in terms of recording sessions.
We actually recorded the entire movie.
Everybody was out for a week where we recorded all the dialogue in the script, all the songs in terms of that week, and we started since we had all the actors, we did a reading of the entire script with the songs, everybody singing the songs and the actors doing their dialogue.
And it was pretty exciting, except that when it was over, it turned out that nobody had pressed record.
We hadn't recorded the entire reading.
And we actually then went back and did it again.
We did the second take of the entire film.
I guess I blocked all of this out.
You were there, Alan, but it's okay not to remember it.
It was a horrifying thing for us, we felt responsible and we were.
I think we were probably the ones who should have told someone to press record, but...
It's like nobody said action, so they didn't roll the film and they blew up the fort.
But at the same time, after it's going for an hour, it seemed like maybe someone might have wondered whether or not it was supposed to be recorded, but it didn't happen. 'Cause we had had table readings before that that affected the writing of the script and the casting of the characters a little bit.
But at that point, I think we got a sense of the actors playing off of each other more so than anything.
We were happy 'cause we usually hear the actors in isolation and don't hear them as much together in the same room.
And we got a good sense of Ken Mars really feeling like he could be her father, and the difference in voice quality between the crab and Ken and all that.
I think it came to life in the room, but I don't think that we really rewrote much based on that reading.
No, I don't think we did a lot of rewriting.
I know we were a little concerned at the time, because we may have been a little over-rehearsed at this point, which is the difference between Broadway and movies.
In animation, normally, we don't rehearse a lot.
The actor comes in kind of familiar, but there's a freshness to that.
As they're just doing the dialogue spontaneously, that we realized that the actors had learned this like a stage play.
But there's a certain slight sense of losing spontaneity that way, so that they almost had to work in the recording to try to get the spontaneity back.
Usually, the way we did the recording of the actors, Ron would be out in the recording studio with the actor helping prompt them and give them specific on-site direction.
I would be in the recording booth trying to hear it more the way an animator would hear it.
I didn't almost look at the actor, and I would just listen to the tracks and try and just listen to the vocal performance.
And Ron was doing that with Buddy, and Buddy didn't like having somebody breathing down his neck.
So, he did mention to Ron, "I'd like to do this again.
Alone." And I slumped out.
We did a little sound trick on her voice there when it's this disembodied voice, we made it sound a little bit more ethereal, and then as it comes back into her throat, then we dissolved off that effect to give it more of Jodi's natural voice.
In our first script, our first treatment even, it's very easy to write that she has the most beautiful singing voice anyone has ever heard.
And now comes the point...
Now, you've gotta find somebody who can live up to that.
But I think Jodi was the girl.
One thing I do remember is throughout the whole process, dreading the post-production in which we were going to have to thread that voice through, and orchestrate around it and somehow make it work.
It's very complicated.
I know that the earlier scene where Ariel loses her voice and it goes into the shell works beautifully.
And it seemed like it might be problematic, but you really have the sense that she's singing, and yet suddenly, the voice is now in the shell and it's not in her anymore.
And through the mixing and through the performance, everything, -that just really sold the idea.
Disney has great sound people.
Great mixers.
Mel Metcalfe was the music mixer on this.
Terry Porter was the head mixer and Mel did the music mix.
Terry Porter did all the dialogue mixing and made all the different recordings -to match perfectly with the rich vocals.
Fantastic guys. ...binding and completely unbreakable, even for you.
I remember we had big meetings, long meetings, all about hair, just about hair and how to handle hair.
Underwater, things need to move.
So, it made it a more complicated movie, in that we wanted the hair generally not to be at rest, just to keep alive the feeling that you are underwater.
It added a lot of complexity, because the hair had to move at all times in the underwater sequences.
Whereas in normal animation, characters go into holes, they rest.
That gives the animator a rest, too.
But in this case, there was a lot of extra work that the audience isn't really conscious of.
But it adds a lot to the underwater scenes.
We had a great story crew on this film, all the storyboard artists, Ed Gombert, who also did the Under the Sea sequence, and Roger Alters, who was a director on The Lion King, Gary Trousdale, who was a director on Beauty and the Beast.
We just had a fantastic storyboard crew.
Chuck Campbell, who did the sound effects on Roger Rabbit, his team, Lou Edemann and Rick Franklin particularly did a lot of the specific cutting for the film.
They were the team that really helped create the sound for the movie, trying to get a unique underwater sound and a fuller effects track than had ever been done on an animated film to that point that we had been involved with, certainly.
And they had to really try a lot of things to get variety in the underwater ambience.
And there was a lot of work done with that.
One thing I felt was good on Mermaid that we didn't have to deal with was we didn't have to really deal with comparisons, in the sense that nothing like this had been done before at all, really.
And certainly nothing had been done like this for years.
So, it was like, "This is a real musical!" "This is fresh.
These songs are so great and they tell the story." But then, say, like when Beauty and the Beast is done, you're now comparing music you're hearing for the first time with Mermaid, which is music that's become a part of you.
So, I've always noticed on the reviews that when the next film comes out, there were early reviews of Beauty and the Beast that would say, "Well, this score is good, but it's not Mermaid." And then Aladdin would come out and it would say, "This score is good," "but it's not Beauty and the Beast." How can you compare something that you're just hearing for the first time?
We had a different version of this earlier where the witch didn't grow huge, and Ariel stepped in the way of her bolt at the Prince and there was a whole different scenario here.
And our boss, Jeffrey Katzenberg, felt like it wasn't a big enough climax.
And at the time, the movie Die Hard had come out.
And he's like, "Guys, I want more Die Hard." "How do we get Die Hard into The Little Mermaid?" So, we wound up with this giant witch, which wasn't in the earlier draft, and tried to make her more of a formidable obstacle, 'cause she didn't seem formidable enough in the earlier version.
Also, I think it was always intended that she would be killed, which is tricky.
But by transforming her into this monstrous giant, maybe that made it more acceptable to do her in.
Although she still is done in in a fairly violent way.
These were all long sequences, and it was...
You're just pulling the music out of you. "Okay, another 20 bars." Are we done yet?
Another 20 bars of Sturm und Drang.
Every time I see the end of this movie, the general feeling that I get inside is exhaustion, I remember.
It was my first score.
And I had come through about two-thirds of the way just fine.
I get to the last third and it's...
Or last quarter...
And it's nonstop wall-to-wall action-adventure hits.
And this was actually in slightly pre-computer days.
So, it helps that you have, nowadays, in terms of synching cues and all that you didn't quite have then.
Well, it was a transitional time.
It was getting into MIDI stuff and all of that.
Right, we were just getting into it.
I was, I think, one of the first people to work exclusively in MIDI.
And it was an amazing help, because in the beginning of doing the score, I would write the score with the click track, and set up my measures and write the music.
And then I said, "I want to see how it sounds." So then, I play it into my computer in MIDI and play it back.
And at some point in the way, I said, "Duh!
Why don't I just write it right onto the computer" "and avoid this second step?" The mermaid on the rock was in the identical pose with the mermaid in Copenhagen.
That was our homage to the iconic statue there in Copenhagen of Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid.
And in terms of Howard's writing contributions, this one may be the biggest of all.
This scene was originally played more pantomime.
The same idea, but without words.
And then Howard, as we were going through it, I think, feeling that, "There should be some spoken words here to put this over." And Howard wrote this little scene with the King and the crab.
And the great thing he did is that he put it in subtext.
Obviously, the King is saying, "I'm going to change her into a human." But without ever saying that, he just says, "There's one problem left.
How much I'm going to miss her." And that says everything.
And that was Howard Ashman's line.
I remember talking to Howard, when we were down in Florida when the film was done, and there was, I think, a parade or something where they played music from Mermaid in this parade.
I remember Howard crying because he thought, "This movie is going to last beyond me." And I think that was his first feeling that this actually might move into the culture, move into something, that was going to go beyond his own life.
And so much of Mermaid is Howard, I think, obviously. -He got teary about that, huh?
Yeah.
But I think it was because he knew his days were numbered. -And that's for Howard.
He was so vulnerable.
A man who was so tough.
He could just tear you out of the room.
You come in, you go, "isn't this great?" And Howard would go, "Well." We did want to wrap up all the characters here. -Wedding bells and Louis.
So we brought Louis back.
Again, Jeffrey felt like the crab needed to give Louis his comeuppance.
And so, we story-boarded this rather late in the process and animated it.
We had an earlier idea where Louis and the crab become friends.
And shout, "Friends, schmiends!" I still wince slightly at this "yes" moment coming up on the crab, but...
Teeth coming out.
And to give Jeffrey his props, he wanted to add the line, "I love you, Daddy." Originally, we didn't have that in that scene.
We just had an over-the-shoulder shot. "And he was like," Well, you can put that over the shot 'just to cement the..." And so, here, the first Disney chorus probably for quite a few years.
At first, Howard wasn't so sure about using a Disney chorus.
And he was like, "Is that too old-fashioned?" But eventually, I think he thought, "No.
That actually aligns the movie" "with these great Disney classics." We had to reflect back to the classic Disney score.
Snow White and Pinocchio and all those things, and this was a chance to do it.
This particular shot right here is actually the first CAPS shot, which is Computer Animated Production System.
Yeah, rather than using cels in that shot, all the characters were painted in the computer, and that ship was all composited in the computer.
Then that process later went on to be used completely from The Rescuers Down Under to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King.
But that was its first test run.
It didn't work particularly.
We had a lot of problems with it just in that one scene.
Every aspect of this production, you could say we definitely tested the waters -with The Little Mermaid. -Right.
We were trying things that hadn't been done in a long time.
And we didn't know how to do it necessarily.
It was a stretch for all of us, I think.
That was fun for us to challenge ourselves.
But this established a new mold mandatory for every animated film after.
It established the idea of an "I Want" song, which was not a formula idea within this, but...
And it made the Disney choir okay again.
And definitely break into song was okay again.
And our attempt in all this was we wanted to make a film that reflected our sensibilities.
And it wasn't a film that you just found like it came from 1940, and you open the vault and there it was.
And I think it's a testament to the people, Howard and Alan and all of the artists, everyone involved in it, that they tried to put something of their own lives and their point of view into it.
So, they brought themselves into the movie.
And that spirit, I think, is what helped make it the success that it became.
It was also the film that kind of re-established the idea that animated films could be watched and enjoyed by adults and young people even without children.
It's hugely hip among theater audiences.
It became a date movie.
I don't know that anyone expected that, it wasn't made with that in mind.
But it was a film for audiences of all ages, and it lived up to that.
I think that it works on different levels, so that a little kid watching it can watch it in a certain way.
And an older person can watch it from a completely different perspective, but definitely get something out of it that's meaningful.
That's what Sebastian's there for.
A whole generation of kids are now interested in going into musical theater, going into film, going into animation because of The Little Mermaid.
And swimming.
Swimming became popular.
Sometimes I feel guilty.
I hope that they can all make a living.
Yeah.
I think the music is central to the movie's longevity.
And just the freshness of it, and the emotion that Alan and Howard got into this music.
And the relatability of the father-daughter story, as well as the characters and the fantasy, and the entertainment values of it.
I think musicals had sort of become out of fashion to some degree in film, and that this reminded people that there's something really wonderful when it's all mixed together -in a way that works.
Yeah.
We were sort of regarded as heroes for making this movie, in a way, in that the movie musical was dead and buried -and eulogized and gone.
Right.
It's still hard.
Right now, it's hard to get the movie musical back on its feet again.
But every generation has something that at least keeps the flame alive.
And it's interesting how beloved this is.
It trumps all the other projects.
It was the one that everyone attached to emotionally.
And when you think back, -how young and innocent we were.
Innocent is the word, I'd really say.
More so, at the time, I think, we were sort of, "Gee, this is kind of edgy for a Disney movie." "This has some things that's never been done," "and Louis the chef and those things." But you look at it again, and this is so sweet and so innocent.
But not even just the film, I think the atmosphere in which it was made, there was an atmosphere of "We're behind the eight ball, gotta get the movie done." It's usually, "Go faster, you're behind schedule." And yet, we didn't have the weight of Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, and all those other things, it was like, we wanted to do a fairytale, we had the weight of Disney fairytales behind us.
We'd all like to do something that lives up to that legacy, and that was imposing, but there wasn't cynicism about, "We have to repeat this, or we have to avoid this." It was just do what we felt seemed right for it.
And you just went with your gut, and I think it was very innocent that way.
And everybody was young.
So this is John Musker, thanking you for joining us on this little trip down memory lane, and hope you enjoyed The Little Mermaid as much as we enjoyed making it.
And this is Ron Clements, thanking you for listening to this and watching all this.
And hoping that you learned a little more about the making of this film that's certainly very special to me and to all of us who worked on it.
This is Alan Menken, and I want to tell you what a pleasure it's been for me to share this time with my collaborators here, and sharing memories about The Little Mermaid.
My name's Ralph, and I'm a bad guy.
Let's see.
I'm nine feet tall.
I weigh 643 pounds.
Got a little bit of a temper on me.
My passion bubbles very near the surface, I guess, not gonna lie.
Anyhoo, what else?
I'm a wrecker.
I wreck things.
Professionally.
I'm very good at what I do.
Probably the best I know.
The thing is, fixing is the name of the game.
Literally,  Fix-It Felix, Jr.
So, yeah, naturally, the guy with the name Fix-It Felix is the good guy.
He's nice enough as good guys go.
Definitely fixes stuff really well.
But if you've got a magic hammer from your father, how hard can it be?
If he was a regular contractor carpenter guy, I guarantee you would not be able to fix the damage that I do as quickly.
And when Felix does a good job, he gets a medal.
But are there medals for wrecking stuff really well?
To that I say, "Ha!" And, no, there aren't.
Thirty years I've been doing this and I've seen a lot of other games come and go.
Kind of sad.
I think about all those guys from  Asteroids.
Boom!
Gone.
Centipede?
Who knows where that guy is, you know?
Look, a steady arcade gig is nothing to sneeze at.
I'm very lucky.
It's just, I got to say, it becomes kind of hard to love your job when no one seems to like you for doing it.
All clear!
The arcade is closed!
Shoryuken!
Whoo!
What a day!
You want to head to Tappers, Ken?
If you're buying, buddy.
Quitting time!
I don't know.
Maybe I wouldn't be feeling this way if things were different after work.
But it is what it is.
Good job, everyone!
Felix and the Nicelanders go hang out in their homes which he's just fixed, and everyone, you know...
They go to their homes, I go to mine which happens to be a dump.
And when I say "a dump," I don't mean like a shabby place.
I mean an actual dump, where the garbage goes and a bunch of bricks and smashed building parts...
That's what I call home.
I guess I can't bellyache too much.
I got my bricks, I got my stump.
It looks uncomfortable.
It's actually fine.
I'm good.
But if I'm really honest with myself...
I see Felix up there getting patted on the back, people are giving him pie and thanking him and so happy to see him all the time.
Sometimes I think...
Man, it sure must be nice being the good guy.
Nice share, Ralph.
As fellow bad guys, we've all felt what you're feeling and we've come to terms with it.
Really?
Right here.
I am Zangief.
I am bad guy.
Hi, Zangief!
Hi, Zangief.
I relate to you, Ralph.
When I hit bottom, I was crushing man's skull like sparrow egg between my thighs.
And I think, "Why do you have to be so bad, Zangief? "Why can't you be more like good guy?" Then I have moment of clarity.
If Zangief is good guy, who'll crush man's skull like sparrow's egg between thighs?
And I say, "Zangief, you are bad guy, "but this does not mean you are 'bad' guy." Right.
I'm sorry.
You lost me there.
Zombie!
Bad guy!
Hi, Zombie.
Hi, Zombie.
Zangief saying labels not make you happy.
Good!
Bad!
You must love you.
Yeah!
Inside here!
Yes.
Okay.
All right, I get you.
Watch out.
It's dripping.
Question, Ralph.
We've been asking you to Bad-Anon for years now and tonight you finally show up.
Why is that?
I don't know.
I just felt like coming.
I suppose it has something to do with the fact that...
Well, today is the 30th anniversary of my game.
Well, happy anniversary, Ralph.
Thanks, Satan.
It's Sateen, actually.
Got it.
But here's the thing.
I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.
You can't mess with the program, Ralph.
You're not going Turbo, are you?
Turbo?
No, I'm not going Turbo!
Come on, guys!
Is it Turbo to want a friend?
Or a medal?
Or a piece of pie every once in a while?
Is it Turbo to want more out of life?
Yes!
Ralph, Ralph, we get it.
But we can't change who we are.
And the sooner you accept that, the better off your game and your life will be.
Hey.
One game at a time, Ralph.
Let's close out with the Bad Guy Affirmation.
I'm bad, and that's good.
I will never be good, and that's not bad.
There's no one I'd rather be than me.
Okay, gang, see you next week.
Listen, I can't do snacks next week.
Hang in there, Ralph.
Hey, Zombie, don't forget your hatchets.
There you go.
Step aside, sir.
Random security check.
Random my behind!
You always stop me.
I'm just a surge protector doing my job, sir.
Name?
Lara Croft.
Name?
Wreck-It Ralph!
And where are you coming from?
Pac-Man.
Did you bring any fruit with you?
No!
No.
No fruit.
Okay, then.
Where are you heading?
Fix-It Felix Jr.
Anything to declare?
I hate you.
I get that a lot.
Proceed.
Bad guy coming!
If you leave your game, stay safe, stay alert, and whatever you do, don't die.
Because if you die outside your own game you don't regenerate.
Ever.
Game over.
Here you go, buddy.
It's fresh.
Straight from Pac-Man's.
Hang in there, guys.
Name? "Happy 30th Anniversary"?
They're having a party without me.
Pac-Man?
They invited Pac-Man?
That cherry-chasing dot-muncher isn't even part of this game!
Great party, Felix.
Why, thank you, friend.
Felix.
You're needed on the dance floor!
Fix-It Felix!
Fix-It Felix!
I'll bet that's Mario.
Fashionably late, per the norm.
I'll get it, Felix.
It's Ralph!
He'll wreck the party!
Hide the stemware!
Get rid of him, Felix.
Oh, right.
I'll go talk to him.
Carry on, everyone.
Ralph, can I help you?
Hey, Felix.
Just wanted to check on you.
I saw a big explosion or something go over the building there.
Those were just fireworks.
Fireworks.
Okay.
Phewf.
Somebody's birthday, or...
Well, it's more of an anniversary.
The 30th anniversary of our game, actually.
What?
Is that today?
I know!
I'm such a dummy with dates.
Anyway, congratulations.
Thank you, Ralph.
And to you, too.
Just a heads-up, Felix.
They're bringing out the cake in a few shakes.
Hey, Glen.
Ralph.
Cake?
Heard about this cake stuff.
Never had it.
No one ever seems to throw it out so it never ends up in the dump.
I never actually tasted it.
I've always wanted to try cake.
I don't suppose you'd like to come in and have a slice, would you?
Hey-o, everybody!
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Fit as a fiddle.
Now, you all know Ralph.
Evening.
Evening, Nell, Lucy, Don, Dana...
Deanna.
Big Gene!
Why is he here?
He's just here for a slice of cake.
And I'm a big part of the game, technically speaking.
Why are you here, Gene?
Oh, look!
The cake!
Well, I'll be dipped.
You've really outdone yourself, Mary.
Oh, and look!
There's all of us at the top.
Each apartment is everyone's favorite flavor.
Norwood's is red velvet.
Guilty!
And lemon for Lucy, rum cake for Gene, and for Felix...
Hey, Mary.
What's the flavor of that mud that I'm stuck in there?
Oh.
Chocolate.
I've never been real fond of chocolate.
Well, I did not know that.
One other little thing.
I hate to be picky, but this angry little guy here...
My cake! ...might be a lot happier if you put him up here with everyone else.
See that?
Look at that smile.
No, no.
You see, Ralph, there's no room for you up here.
What about this?
We can make room.
Here.
We could take turns.
Easy.
How about we just eat the cake?
Hang on.
Felix needs to be on the roof because he's about to get his medal!
Then how about we just take that medal and give it to Ralph for once?
Would that be the end of the world, Gene?
Now you're just being ridiculous.
Only good guys win medals, and you, sir, are no good guy.
I could be a good guy if I wanted to, and I could win a medal!
And when you do, come and talk to us.
Then would you finally let me be on top of the cake with you guys?
If you won a medal, we'd let you live up here in the penthouse!
But it will never happen because you're just the bad guy who wrecks the building.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are.
All right, Gene.
You know what?
I'm going to win a medal.
Oh, I am going to win a medal!
The shiniest medal this place has ever seen!
A medal that will be so good that it will make Felix's medals wet their pants!
And good night!
Thank you for the party.
Is he serious?
Oh, please!
Where's a bad guy going to win a medal?
Of course he's not serious.
I've never been more serious about anything in my life.
That's why I came straight here, Tapper.
You've never given me a bum steer.
Now, come on.
Where can a guy like me go and win a medal?
I don't think such a game exists, Ralph.
Oh, come on.
You know people.
There's got to be...
Tapper, I need a root beer.
Coming!
Hold that thought.
Okay.
As you were saying.
I was saying, I can't spend another 30 years living alone in the garbage.
I'm not going back without a medal.
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe somebody left a medal here.
You're welcome to dig through the lost and found.
Okay, let's see what we got here.
Go on, get out of here.
Mushroom?
No.
What is this?
No.
Come on, Zangief!
Gross.
What am I doing?
Hey, excuse you!
We are humanity's last hope.
Our mission?
Destroy all Cy-Bugs.
We are humanity's last hope.
You okay there, space cadet?
We've only been plugged in a week and every day it's, "Climb the building, then fight bugs. "Climb the building, fight more bugs!" Yeah, yeah.
Right.
Look.
Easy on the overalls, spaceman.
It's tough all over, all right?
And all for what?
A lousy medal?
Medal?
You win a medal?
Yeah, Medal of Heroes.
Is it shiny?
Pretty shiny.
And it says "hero" on it?
Oh, yeah.
And you say you win it by climbing a building?
And fighting bugs!
Right, bugs.
Is there any chance I could go with you to your game and maybe get one of those medals?
Negatory.
Does that mean maybe?
No!
Look, only the bravest and the best serve in our corps.
Bug!
We are humanity's last hope.
Attention!
The arcade will open in five minutes.
Please report to your games.
I can't feel my legs.
What is all this stuff?
Smells like Ralph in here.
Okay.
All right.
What was it called again?
Hero's something.
Duty.
Hero's Duty.
There it is.
Sorry, Q*bert.
It's me, Ralph.
The wall.
Morning, kids.
Come on in.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
You, too, little fella.
Quarter alert!
Quarter alert!
This is not a drill.
Ooh!
Sweet golden medal!
On a planet with no name a top-secret experiment has gone horribly wrong.
You are humanity's last hope.
Rooting-tooting, ready for shooting!
All right.
Now listen up, because I'm only going to say this once.
Fear is a four-letter word, ladies.
If you want to go pee-pee in your big-boy slacks, keep it to yourself.
It's make your mamas proud time!
I love my mama!
Heads up!
First-person shooter, coming through!
Ooh, robot!
Game play in three, two, one.
We are humanity's last hope.
Our mission?
Destroy all Cy-Bugs.
You ready, rookie?
Let's find out.
Sweet Mother Hubbard!
No, no, no!
Wait a second!
Cy-Bug, twelve o'clock.
Take it, newbie.
No, no!
Wait, wait!
Watch it, rookie!
These monsters become what they eat.
My gun!
Give me that back.
Shoot the eggs before they hatch!
Oh, no!
Something's coming out of their bottom!
Oh, gross!
Markowski!
Get back in formation!
All right, ladies, the kitten whispers and tickle fights stop now.
The entrance to the lab is straight ahead.
I'll meet you guys inside!
No!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
I thought this was going to be like  Centipede!
When did video games become so violent and scary?
Please, get me out of here!
Take her!
What a rip-off!
Get off me!
It's game over.
Stop it!
Beacon up!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Attention!
Return to start positions.
Return to start positions.
Here, let me help you.
Sorry about that.
Yeah, you must be upset.
Markowski.
Who?
Yeah, me.
I'm Markowski.
What's the first rule of  Hero's Duty?
No cuts, no butts, no coconuts?
Never interfere with the first-person shooter.
Our job is to get the gamers to the top of that building so they can get a medal, and that's it!
So stick to the program, soldier!
Right.
Right.
Aye, aye.
Quarter alert!
Quarter alert!
All right, pussy willows.
Back to start positions!
Yeah, right.
No way I'm going through that again.
So that's where they keep the medal, huh? "New racers daily." Sweet!
I got next game.
Go away, kid!
We're going to play all nine of today's racers!
Yeah!
Sorry.
Where's the wrecking guy?
Where's Ralph?
He should be wrecking the building.
Stick with the program.
Fix it, Felix!
Ralph!
Quarter alert!
Game on!
Do something, Felix!
Just act natural.
I'll fix it.
Ralph!
Ralph!
What the...
Ralph?
Ralph!
Oh, my land!
Where is he?
Mr.
Litwak!
What's the trouble, sweetheart?
The game's busted.
I can fix it!
I can fix it!
Oh, boy.
Looks like the game's gone cuckoo, like my nana.
Sorry, sweetie.
Here's your quarter back.
But what about the game?
I'll have someone look at it tomorrow...
But if he can't fix it, it might be time to put old Ralph and Felix out to pasture.
Like my nana.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're out of order.
Sweet mercy!
Without Ralph, we're doomed!
They're going to pull our plug!
Okay, everybody, calm down.
Ralph probably fell asleep in the washroom of Tapper's again.
See?
There he is now.
Why, it's Q*bert.
What brings you here, neighbor?
What's he saying, Felix?
Stand by.
My Q*bert-ese is a little rusty.
Ralph's gone Turbo!
Shiny.
Attention!
The arcade is now closed.
Did you get a load of Markowski?
Shut your chew holes.
Cy-Bug.
Taste it!
Slick Tiddlywinking, pint-size.
I'm Fix-It Felix, Jr., ma'am.
From the game  Fix-It Felix, Jr.
Jiminey jaminey!
Look at that high definition.
Your face!
It's amazing!
Flattery don't charge these batteries, civilian.
Now, state your business.
I'm looking for my colleague, Wreck-it Ralph?
Never heard of him.
Well, Q*bert saw him come in here.
Impossible.
Nothing gets past me.
That came from the tower.
Nice eggs.
Nice eggs!
Okay.
That was easy.
Congratulations, soldier.
It is my honor to bestow upon you the Medal of Heroes.
Wow!
No way!
Ten-hut!
Wow!
History will long revere your courage and sacrifice.
Well, thank you!
You have etched in the rock of virtue a legacy beyond compare.
Thanks, guys.
At ease!
You are the universe's greatest hero.
The living embodiment of all this corps represents.
Bravery.
Integrity.
Grace under pressure.
And above all, dignity.
Escape pod activated.
Get off my face!
Incoming!
Ralph!
Cy-Bug!
Oh, no!
Sayonara,  sucker! "Sugar Rush"?
Oh, no!
This is that candy go-cart game over by the Whac-A-Mole.
I got to get out of here.
Oh, no!
My medal!
No, no, no, no, my medal!
No, no, my medal!
Hi, mister.
Hello.
Man, you scared me, kid.
I nearly soiled myself.
What's your name?
Ralph.
Wreck-It Ralph.
You're not from here, are you?
No, well, yeah.
I mean, not from right in this area.
I'm just doing some work here.
What kind of work?
Some routine candy tree trimming.
You probably want to stand back.
In fact, this whole area is technically closed while we're trimming.
Who's "we"?
Candy tree department.
Where is everybody else?
It's just me today.
So you just meant like the royal "we"?
Yep.
That's right.
Hey, are you a hobo?
No.
I'm not a hobo, but I am busy.
Okay?
So you go home.
What's that?
Didn't hear you.
Your breath is so bad it made my ears numb.
Listen, I tried to be nice.
I tried to be nice.
You're mimicking me.
You're mimicking me!
Okay.
Okay.
That is rude, and this conversation is over.
And this conversation is over.
I wouldn't grab that branch if I were you.
I'm from the candy tree department, so I know what...
It's a double stripe.
Double stripes break.
Why are your hands so freakishly big?
I don't know.
Why are you so freakishly annoying?
Why are you so freakishly...
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
A gold coin!
Don't even think about it.
That is mine.
Race you for it!
Hey!
I don't have to race for it because it's mine!
Double stripe!
Come back here!
The winner!
Give it back!
Give it!
Double stripe.
Thank you!
Wait!
Let me talk to you for one second.
Okay.
Here's the thing.
I'm not from the candy tree department.
Lying to a child.
Shame on you, Ralph.
But I wasn't lying about the medal.
That is my medal!
That's why I was climbing the tree.
It's mine!
It's precious to me.
That thing is my ticket to a better life.
Yeah, well, now it's my ticket.
What the...
See you, chump!
Come back!
I'll find you!
I will find you!
Double stripe!
Nowhere to hide!
Yeah, he banged around in here like some kind of hot shot, then he went barreling down into that sweet little game like a crazy person. "Sugar Rush." Cy-Bugs would chew up that game faster than a chicken hawk in a coop of crippled roosters.
What was that, now?
What are you, thick?
There was a Cy-Bug on that shuttle!
Do you even know what a Cy-Bug is?
I can't say that I do, ma'am.
Cy-Bugs are like a virus.
They don't know they're in a game.
All they know is eat, kill, multiply.
Without a beacon to stop them, they'll consume  Sugar Rush.
But do you think they'll stop there?
Yes!
Wrong!
Viruses do not stop!
Once those Cy-Bugs finish off  Sugar Rush, they'll invade every other game until this arcade is nothing but a smoking husk of forgotten dreams.
Kohut!
My cruiser.
Jeepers.
Is she always this intense?
It's not her fault.
She's programmed with the most tragic back-story ever.
The one day she didn't do a perimeter check...
Her wedding day.
Wait, ma'am!
I'm going with you.
Like fun you are, short stack.
If you die outside your game, you don't regenerate.
Well, neither do you, ma'am.
And it is my job to fix what Ralph wrecks.
And I cannot ask you to risk your life cleaning up his mess.
No flex on this one, ma'am.
I am coming along with you.
Citizens of Sugar Rush...
Just in time. ...all hail our rightful ruler, King Candy.
Hello, my royal subjects!
Have some candy!
Thank you for that stirring introduction, Sour Bill.
And thank you to today's avatars.
It was a wonderful day of racing.
It was.
But now the arcade is closed, so it's time to wipe the slate clean and race to decide our new roster.
The first nine racers across that finish line will represent Sugar Rush as tomorrow's avatars!
Race!
Race!
Race!
Okay, calm down.
Listen!
This event is pay-to-play.
We all know this.
The fee to compete is one gold coin from your previous winnings, if you've ever won, which I have.
Let me go first!
King Candy!
Taffyta Muttonfudge!
Stay sweet!
Adorabeezle Winterpop.
Gloyd Orangeboar!
Little stealer!
Wait till I catch that brat.
Minty Zaki.
Snowanna Rainbeau.
Rancis Fluggerbutter.
Jubileena Bing-Bing.
Swizzle Malarkey.
Candlehead.
Sour Bill, who's that last one?
Vanellope von Schweetz!
Yippee!
I'm in the race!
Vanellope?
The Glitch!
Now, now!
Everything is all right!
Security!
Come here, kid!
We're not going to hurt you, you little freak!
Get back here!
Slow down!
Slow down a little bit.
You!
Give me back my medal right now!
Ah, boy!
Go!
What is that?
Come on!
Go!
Roll!
Careful!
What are you doing?
Come back here!
I can't move!
Now we got him!
Oh, good, the cops.
She went that way!
Hold still!
Take that!
What are you doing?
Okay, folks.
Calm down!
Everything's all right.
The monster's been caught!
We'll repair all the damage.
Don't worry.
We will have our race before the arcade opens.
And I'm in it.
Yes!
There's no way that I am racing with a glitch.
Rancis, Candlehead, come on.
Sour Bill, that glitch cannot be allowed to race!
And bring that thing to my castle.
Guys!
She took...
Or-e-oh Oreo!
Or-e-oh Sour Bill, de-taffify this monster so we can see what we're up against here.
Mm-kay.
Milk my duds!
It's Wreck-It Ralph?
Yeah.
Who are you, the guy that makes the donuts?
Please.
No.
I'm King Candy!
I see you're a fan of pink.
Salmon.
Salmon, that's obviously...
What are you doing here?
Look, Your Candiness, this is just a big misunderstanding.
Just get me out of this cupcake, I'll get my medal, and I'll be out of your way.
Your medal?
Bad guys don't win medals.
Well, this one did.
I earned it over in  Hero's Duty.
You game-jumped?
Ralph, you're not going Turbo, are you?
What?
No, no.
Because if you think you can come in here to my kingdom and take over my game, you've got another thing coming!
Easy, Your Puffiness.
It's not my fault one of your children of the candy corn stole my medal. "Children of the candy corn"?
Who'd...
The Glitch!
The coin she used to buy her way into the race.
That was your medal?
She did what?
I need that back!
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you.
It's gone, you know.
It's nothing but code now.
It will stay that way until someone wins the cup at the end of the race.
Maybe I'll have to have a little talk with the winner then.
Is that a threat I smell?
Beyond the halitosis you so obviously suffer from.
Listen, Nilly-Wafer, I'm not leaving without my medal!
Yes, you are.
Wynnchel, Duncan, get him out of that cupcake and on the first train back home.
If I ever see you here again, Wreck-It Ralph, I'll lock you in my fungeon.
Fungeon?
Fun dungeon, you know?
It's a play on words.
It's the...
Never mind!
I've got a glitch to deal with, thanks to you.
Goodbye, Wreck-it Ralph!
It hasn't been a pleasure.
This thing is hard as a rock.
I can see that.
Get the tools.
What tools?
Quiet, you!
What?
No!
Take it easy, big boy!
Stay away from me!
He's getting away!
Quick!
Call out the Devil Dogs.
Chocolate.
I hate chocolate!
I got to get my medal back.
The pot goes to the winning racer!
Hey, kids!
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hello, fellow racers!
It's that little crumb snatcher.
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis, you're looking well.
Came by to check out the competition, huh?
Well, here it is, the Lickety-Split!
Sheesh.
Looks like she built it herself.
I built it myself.
Fastest pedal-power west of the Whac-A-Mole.
Check her out.
Vanellope, it's so...
You.
But you have to back out of the race.
Yeah.
No, I don't, because I paid my fee and I'm on the board...
So, yeah, I'm definitely racing.
Yeah, well, King Candy says glitches can't race.
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta.
I've just got pixslexia, okay?
The rules are there for a reason, Vanellope.
To protect us.
Say I'm you.
I'm in my weird little car and I'm driving and I actually feel kind of cool for once.
And then, all of a sudden, oh, no.
I'm glitching!
Hey!
See?
You're an accident just waiting to happen.
Oh, no!
I glitched, too!
Uncool.
Stop it!
Stop!
You're breaking it!
Please!
I just want to race like you guys.
You will never be a racer because you're a glitch.
And that's all you'll ever be!
Hey!
Leave her alone!
Let's get out of here!
Scram, you rotten little cavities!
Before I throw you in the mud!
What are you looking at?
You're welcome, you rotten little thief.
I'm not a thief!
I just borrowed your stupid coin.
I was going to give it back to you as soon as I won the race.
It's not a coin.
It is a medal.
Coin, medal, whatever.
Just go back to your own dumb game and win another one.
I can't.
I didn't win it in my game.
I won it in  Hero's Duty.
Hero's Doodie?
It's not that kind of duty.
I bet you really got to watch where you step in a game called  Hero's Doodie!
What did you win the medal for, wiping?
I hope you washed your hands after you handled that medal.
Listen!
One more, one more.
Why did the hero flush the toilet?
Say "why." Why?
Because it was his doodie!
How dare you insult  Hero's Duty?
You little guttersnipe!
I earned that medal and you better get it back for me toot-sweet, sister!
Well, unless you've got a go-cart hidden in the fat folds of your neck, I can't help you!
What a moron.
Hey, genius!
It's a jawbreaker.
You're never going to break...
Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper baby?
Leave me alone.
Look, you want that medal, right?
And I want to race.
So here's what I'm thinking.
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...
And I'll win the race and get you back your medal.
You want me to help you?
All you got to do is break something for me.
Come on.
What do you say, friend?
We are not friends.
Come on, pal.
You son of a gun.
Come on, buddy.
Let's shake on it.
Come on, chumbo.
Ralph, my man.
My main man.
Hey!
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?
You better win.
Well, I'll say this much, they don't call your friend "Wreck-It" for nothing.
There's the shuttle.
Is he in there?
Nope.
Lucky for him.
Otherwise I would have slapped his corpse.
No Cy-Bug, either.
Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs.
It came this way, but the sugar particles in the atmosphere are jamming my sensor.
Can't get a read on it.
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?
Why did he go AWOL?
I wish I knew, ma'am.
He was acting all squirrelly last night...
Going on about cake and medals...
But I never thought he'd go Turbo. "Go Turbo"?
That's right, you guys just got plugged in.
Well, back when the arcade first opened, Turbo Time  was by far the most popular game.
And Turbo...
Turbo-tastic!
He loved the attention.
Turbo-tastic!
So, when  RoadBlasters  got plugged in and stole Turbo's thunder...
New game.
All right!
Boy, was he jealous.
So jealous that he abandoned his game and tried to take over the new one.
These are the greatest graphics I've ever seen!
Turbo-tastic!
Hey.
Is that...
That looks like Turbo.
What's Turbo doing in this game?
Aw, come on!
Mr.
Litwak!
Turbo ended up putting both games and himself out of order, for good.
Yes, the selfish man is like a mangy dog chasing a cautionary tale.
I know, right?
That's why I have to get Ralph home or the same thing's gonna happen to my game.
What is this? "Nesquik Sand"?
Quicksand?
I'll hop out and grab you one of those vines.
I can't hop.
I'm hop-less.
This is hopeless!
We're going to drown here.
Stop thrashing.
Stop moving.
You're making us sink faster.
We're going to die!
Get ahold of yourself!
The vines.
They're Laffy Taffy.
They're attracted to whatever makes them laugh.
Here, hit me again.
That's not funny enough.
Harder!
Look, you're a nice guy.
I can't...
No, ma'am!
The arcade is depending on us.
Now do your duty.
That's an ord...
It's working!
Hit me again.
Your eye.
I can fix it.
Now...
San Fran-tastic!
Again!
You mean business!
Yikes on bikes!
Wow!
We're... killing... them!
Comedy gold!
All right, enough with the goo-goo eyes.
We've got work to do.
Let's go.
We lost the Cy-Bug.
Come on.
We'll get a better view from the air.
You think you can fix that shuttle?
Can do.
All right, do your thing, knuckles.
Bust it open!
What's this?
You're a full-on criminal, aren't you?
Hey, we shook on it.
Thank you, Jeeves.
What is this place?
Where are the carts?
You gotta make one.
What?
No, no.
Look, kid, bad idea.
Trust me.
I don't make things.
I break things.
Well, it looks like you're going to be stepping outside your comfort zone, then, Gladys.
This is a good one!
Welcome to the bakery!
Let's bake a kart!
What is this, another game?
Yeah, well, it's a mini-game.
You have one minute to win it.
What?
Come on, Ralph!
Go!
Mixing.
Put the ingredients in the bowl and throw away the trash.
Hairbrush.
No!
Underpants.
No, no!
You're getting all the wrong stuff, kid.
I'm trying!
Let me up there.
I'll do it.
No.
Yes.
Gross.
Milk.
Yes, yes, yes.
Batter up!
Come on!
No sleeping on the job!
Baking!
Pump up the heat and hold the perfect temperature.
Ralph, a little help here?
I'm on it.
Yeah, no problem.
Give me this thing here.
Okay, good.
Little more.
Yeah, that's it!
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Yes!
Come on.
Get up, Ralph!
Fifteen seconds!
Decorating!
Wheels first.
How many?
Four, doy!
Got it.
Now frosting.
A buttload of frosting!
No problem.
Time's up!
Congratulations.
You did it, and here's your cart!
Look, kid...
I tried to warn you.
I can't make things.
I just break...
I love it.
You do?
I love it.
I love it!
I love it!
I love it!
Look, it's got a real engine!
And look at these wheels.
I love it!
I finally have a real cart!
Come on.
A work of art like this must be signed.
Cream puffs.
This is Beard Papa.
The Glitch is in the bakery!
Get me King Candy!
What?
You have teeth?
I don't think I've ever seen you smile before.
I'm not smiling.
I was...
I'm gassy, okay?
Hold it right there, Glitch!
And Wreck-It Ralph?
Start the cart!
Start the cart!
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
Let's go!
I don't know how to drive a real cart.
You don't what?
Are you hurt, Sire?
No, he just glazed me.
Get them!
Gangway!
Stop, in the name of the king!
That's me!
Get off the road!
Head for Diet Cola Mountain!
Drive into the wall!
What?
Right there, between the two sugar-free lollipops!
Are you crazy?
Just do it!
Where did they go?
They should have just turned.
Find that glitch!
Destroy that cart!
She can't be allowed to race!
So let me get this straight.
You don't know how to drive.
Well, no, not technically.
I just thought that...
What did you think? "I'll just magically win the race "just because I really want to!" Look, wise guy.
I know I'm a racer.
I can feel it in my code.
That's it!
I'm never getting my medal back.
What is the big whoop about that crummy medal anyway?
The big whoop?
Well, this may come as a shock to you, but in my game, I'm the bad guy and I live in the garbage.
Cool.
No.
Not cool.
Unhygienic and lonely and boring.
And that crummy medal was going to change all that.
I go home with that baby around my neck and I'll get a penthouse.
Pies.
Ice sculptures.
Fireworks!
It's grown-up stuff.
You wouldn't understand.
No, I get it!
That's exactly what racing would do for me!
Well, guess what?
What?
News flash!
Neither one of us is getting what we want!
What was that?
Yeah!
Check it out.
Look!
You got to watch out for the splash.
That stuff is broiling hot.
Yeah, I got that.
Thank you.
What is this dump?
I think it's some sort of unfinished bonus level.
Yeah.
It's pretty cool, huh?
I found that secret opening, and now I live here.
See?
Look, look, look.
Welcome to my home!
I sleep in these candy wrappers.
I bundle myself up like a little homeless lady.
By yourself?
With all this garbage around you?
Well, yeah.
I mean, everyone here says I'm just a mistake and that I wasn't even supposed to exist.
What do you expect?
Listen, kid...
I know it's none of my business but why do you even stick around this game?
You really don't know anything, do you?
Glitches can't leave their games.
It's one of the joys of being me.
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on!
I know it's a dump, but it's all I got.
If you're going to be a racer, you're going to have to learn how to drive.
And you can't do that without a track.
All right, now.
Let's hustle up.
We've got some driving to do.
I'm going to learn to drive!
I'm going to learn to drive!
Wait.
Do you know how to drive?
Yeah!
I mean, I haven't done it, but...
Look, I flew a spaceship today, okay?
You crashed it.
Just get in.
How hard can it be?
Okay...
Start it up.
There we go.
So there are some buttons on the floor.
Pedals.
Pedals.
Right.
Now, that's the go pedal.
That I believe is the stopper.
And this...
Wait.
What is this?
That doesn't do anything.
What does this joystick do?
Okay, good.
Let's try that again.
Now shift it.
That's good.
Keep going!
Shift it again!
I told you, racing's in my code!
I got that medal in the bag!
Hey, Ralphie, watch this!
Look out!
Hot cola!
So how did I do?
Well, you almost blew up the whole mountain.
Right, right.
That's a good note.
You got to get that glitch under control, kid.
Okay, I will, I will.
And then you think I got a chance?
Tiny.
Yes, I'm going to win!
I'm going to win!
I'm going to win!
Top shelf.
Top shelf.
Did you find her?
Tell me you found her.
You didn't?
Go.
Leave me.
Up, up, down, down...
Start!
The code.
It's the sweet lifeblood of the game.
Where are you?
Let's see...
Stadium, no.
Jumbotron.
There it is.
The winner's cup.
One of these things is not like the others...
It's you!
We're going to give you a nice new home.
Success!
Sour Bill, I'm going out.
You're in charge of the castle until I get back.
Your face is still red.
You might want to hit it again with your hammer.
That's not blunt force trauma, ma'am.
That's just the honey glow in my cheeks.
Okay.
Ma'am, I just got to tell you...
You are one dynamite gal.
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.
One dynamite gal.
Dynamite gal.
Dynamite gal.
Dynamite...
Get out.
All I said is you're a dynamite gal.
I said get out!
Jiminey jaminey.
Yes?
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr., sir, from the game  Fix-It Felix Jr.
Have you seen my friend Ralph?
Wreck-It Ralph?
Yes.
Yes, that's him!
We should have locked him up when we had the chance.
Locked him up?
I'm not making the same mistake with you.
Hurry, hurry!
Let's go.
Time's a-wastin'.
Come on, Ralph!
This is it.
This is really happening.
I almost don't believe it.
I mean, I have dreamt about it for so long, and now...
And now...
Now I think I'm going to puke, actually.
I mean, I think I might puke.
You know, like a "vurp." A what?
Vomit and a burp together, and you can taste it, and it's just like rising up.
This is so exciting!
Yes, it is.
It's exciting.
Am I ready to be a real racer?
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?
Who doesn't love a brat with dirty hair?
Come on.
Those people are going to love you.
You know why?
Because you're a winner.
I'm a winner.
And you're adorable!
I'm adorable!
And everyone loves an adorable winner!
Yeah!
Okay, come on.
Listen to me.
If you get nervous, just keep telling yourself, "I must win Ralph's medal or his life will be ruined." And have fun.
Got it?
Got it.
Oh, wait!
Hold on!
Where are you going?
I forgot something!
I'll be right back!
Kids.
Ralph!
There you are.
Hello!
You!
I come alone, unarmed.
I've had enough of you, pillow pants!
Please.
Calm down!
Please, look.
Don't!
I'm going to beat the filling out of you!
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's...
Well played.
What do you want, Candy?
Listen, I just want to talk to you.
I'm not interested in anything you have to say.
How about this?
Are you interested in this?
My medal.
How did you...
It doesn't matter.
It's yours!
Go ahead, take it.
All I ask is that you hear me out.
About what?
Ralph, do you know what the hardest part about being a king is?
Doing what's right, no matter what.
Get to the point.
Point being, I need your help.
Sad as it is, Vanellope cannot be allowed to race.
Why are you people so against her?
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!
If Vanellope wins that race she'll be added to the race roster.
Then gamers can choose her as their avatar.
And when they see her glitching and twitching and just being herself, they'll think our game is broken.
We'll be put out of order for good.
All my subjects will be homeless.
But there's one who cannot escape because she's a glitch.
Help!
Somebody, help!
Help!
And when the game's plug is pulled...
No! ...she'll die with it.
You don't know that will happen.
The gamers could love her.
And if they don't?
I know it's tough, but heroes have to make the tough choices, don't they?
She can't race, Ralph, but she won't listen to me.
So can I count on you to talk a little sense into her?
Very good.
I'll give you two some time alone.
I'm back!
Did you miss me?
Yeah...
Can we talk for a second?
Wait.
First, kneel down.
What?
No, we really...
Will you just do it?
Okay.
Now, close your eyes.
Vanellope...
Shush!
Close them!
Okay.
Open them up. "To Stinkbrain." Gee, thanks.
Turn it over.
I made it for you.
Just in case we don't win.
Not that I think there's even a remote chance we're not going to win.
Thanks, kid.
Listen...
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.
Ralph, come on.
Move your molasses.
I've been thinking.
That's dangerous.
Who cares about this stupid race anyway?
Right?
That's not very funny, Ralph.
No, I'm serious, and it was really fun to build the car and everything...
But maybe you shouldn't do it.
Hello?
Is Ralph in there?
I'd like to speak to him, please.
Look, what I'm saying is you can't be a racer.
What?
Why would you...
Wait a minute.
No!
Where did you get this?
Look, I'm going to be straight with you, kid.
I've been talking to King Candy.
King Candy?
Yeah.
You sold me out?
No, I didn't...
Listen.
You don't understand.
No, I understand plenty.
Traitor!
I'm not a traitor.
Listen.
You're a rat!
And I don't need you, and I can win the race on my own.
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid!
Put me down!
Let me go!
No, you listen to me.
Do you know what's going to happen when the players see you glitching?
They'll think the game's broken.
I don't care!
You're a liar!
You better care, because if your game goes out of order, you go down with the ship, little sister!
I'm not listening to you!
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!
No, you're not!
Take me down from here, Ralph, right now!
No.
I'm doing this for your own good!
Wait, wait, wait.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no, no!
Please, Ralph!
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
No!
You really are a bad guy.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Felix?
Mary?
Well, you actually went and did it.
Gene.
Where is everybody?
They're gone.
After Felix went to find you and then didn't come back...
Everyone panicked and abandoned ship.
But I'm here now.
It's too late, Ralph.
Litwak's pulling our plug in the morning.
But never let it be said that I'm not a man of my word.
The place is yours, Ralph.
Enjoy.
Gene, wait!
Wait!
Listen, this is not what I wanted!
Well, what did you want, Ralph?
I don't know.
I just...
I was just tired of living alone in the garbage.
Well, now you can live alone in the penthouse.
Hey, cough drop.
Explain something to me.
If Vanellope was never meant to exist, then why is her picture on the side of the game console?
What's going on in this candy-coated heart of darkness?
Nothing.
Talk!
No.
I'll lick you.
You wouldn't.
Oh, yeah?
That's like sandpaper!
Wonder how many licks it will take to get to your center.
I'll take it to my grave!
Fair enough.
They call you Sour Bill for a reason.
Had enough yet?
Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk!
Vanellope was a racer until King Candy tried to delete her code!
Tried to delete her code?
So that's why she's a glitch!
Why is he doing this to her?
I don't know!
Suit yourself.
No, no, no!
I swear I don't know!
He literally locked up our memories and I cannot remember!
Nobody can!
But I do know this.
He'll do anything to keep her from racing.
Because if she crosses the finish line, the game will reset and she won't be a glitch anymore!
Where is she now?
In the fungeon with Fix-It Felix.
Felix?
I'm sorry!
That's all I know, I swear!
Now, please, don't put me back in your filthy mouth again!
Stick around.
Yes, okay, I will.
I will.
Thank you!
Come on.
I know you're out there.
Saccharine-saturated nightmare!
But...
Where?
Doomsday and Armageddon just had a baby and it is ugly!
Hello?
Hello?
Somebody!
Anybody!
Please let me out!
What's he say?
I'm gonna wreck it!
Why do I fix everything I touch?
Felix!
Ralph!
I'm so glad to see you!
Wait.
No, I'm not.
What do you have to say for yourself!
Wait!
I don't want to hear it.
I'm not talking to you!
Okay, don't talk.
That's fine.
But you have to fix this go-cart for me pronto.
I don't have to do boo!
Forgive my potty mouth.
I'm just so, so cross with you!
Do you have any idea what you put me through?
I ran higgledy-piggledy all over creation looking for you.
I almost drowned in chocolate milk-mix!
And then...
I met the most dynamite gal.
She gives me the honey glow something awful.
But she rebuffed my affections.
And then I got thrown in jail!
Felix, pull yourself together.
No!
You don't know what it's like to be rejected and treated like a criminal!
Yes, I do.
That's every day of my life.
It is?
Which is why I ran off and tried to be a good guy, but I'm not!
I'm just a bad guy, and I need your help.
There's a little girl whose only hope is this cart.
Please, Felix, fix it.
And I promise I will never try to be good again.
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.
And?
And a real numskull.
And?
A selfish diaper baby.
And?
And...
A stinkbrain?
The stinkiest brain ever.
My sweet subjects, I can without a pinch of hesitation assure you that I have never been so happy in all my life to say the following words, let the Random Roster Race commence!
Okay, remember, you don't have to win.
Just cross that finish line, and you'll be a real racer.
I'm already a real racer.
And I'm going to win.
Have some candy.
Behind you!
In front of you!
It's The Glitch!
The Glitch?
Light them up, Candlehead.
What's this?
Cherry bombs!
I told you.
You're just an accident waiting to happen.
My candle!
All right.
Gotta keep it under control.
No more glitching.
Okay, kid.
Let's finish this thing without any more surprises.
Hope you're happy, junkpile.
This game is going down, and it's all your fault.
My lady, you came back.
Can it, Fix-It!
That Cy-Bug you brought with you multiplied.
No.
It died in the taffy swamp.
Believe me, I...
Bullroar.
Listen up, people.
Head to Game Central Station now!
Move it!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
No!
Get off of my track!
Hey!
What, are you crazy!
I forbid you to cross that finish line!
Knock it off!
Ralph, look!
Kid!
Stop it!
I'm not letting you undo all my hard work!
Is that...
No way!
What the...
Who are you?
I'm Turbo, the greatest racer ever!
And I did not reprogram this world to let you and that halitosis-riddled warthog take it away from me!
Turbo-tastic.
End of the line, Glitch!
Glitch.
That's it.
Come on, Vanellope.
I know you said you wouldn't do it again but you're going to do it one more time.
Just focus and concentrate and glitch!
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
I did it!
No!
Bring it home, kid!
The finish line is wide open!
No!
Kid!
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Let's finish this race!
Oh, my land.
All right.
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.
But I didn't cross the finish line!
There is no finish line!
Move it or lose it, people.
Everybody, out.
Now!
Ralph, it's not going to work!
We got to try!
Kid!
Ralph, I told you I can't leave the game.
Come on.
Get through.
Ralph!
Stop!
It's got to work!
Stop, it's no use.
It's okay, Ralph.
All right, Fix-It.
That's everyone.
Now, we've got to blow up this exit.
Just go.
Go without me.
But what about this game?
Nothing we can do about it.
Without a beacon, there's no way to stop these monsters.
Beacon?
Stay with Felix.
Let me borrow that thing, lady.
Ralph!
Where are you going?
I got some wrecking to do!
I'll meet you at the finish line!
No!
Wait!
Fix-It, get behind me!
Come on!
One more!
One...
Welcome to the boss level!
Turbo.
Because of you, Ralph, I'm now the most powerful virus in the arcade!
I can take over any game I want.
I should thank you but it would be more fun to kill you.
Get back here, little guy!
Have some candy!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm not through with you yet.
Up we go!
No!
Ralph!
Fall back.
Kid!
Vanellope!
Look at that.
It's your little friend.
Let's watch her die together, shall we?
No!
It's game over for both of you.
No.
Just for me!
Ralph!
Vanellope!
I'm bad, and that's good.
I will never be good, and that's not bad.
There's no one I'd rather be... ...than me.
Kid!
Don't worry.
I got it under control.
You fools!
Why are you going into the ligh...
No!
No, no, no.
Yes...
No!
Yes...
No!
Go into the light!
Chocolate?
It's chocolate!
I love chocolate!
Oh, beautiful chocolate!
Yeah!
You did it, Ralph!
Way to go, brother!
I...
Excuse...
All fixed.
You ready for this?
As ready as I'll ever be.
What's with all the magic sparkles?
Princess Vanellope?
Now I remember.
All hail the rightful ruler of  Sugar Rush...
Princess Vanellope.
I remember.
She's our princess!
Oh, that's right!
We are so sorry about the way we treated you.
Yeah, those were jokes!
I was just doing what Taffyta told me to do!
Tut-tut.
As your merciful princess, I hereby decree that everyone who was ever mean to me shall be executed.
What?
No, please!
Oh, my land.
This place just got interesting.
I don't want to die!
I'm just kidding.
Stop crying, Taffyta.
I'm trying, but it won't stop.
Wow.
So this is the real you.
Princess.
Aw, Ralph, what are you, nuts?
Come on.
This isn't me.
This is me.
Look, the code may say I'm a princess but I know who I really am, Ralph, I'm a racer with the greatest superpower ever.
I was here, I was there.
I was glitching through the walls.
I'm not giving that up.
Pardon me for asking, but without a princess, who's going to lead us?
Yeah.
Who?
Me.
I'm thinking more along the lines of a constitutional democracy.
President Vanellope von Schweetz.
Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?
Fix-It, Wreck-It, the arcade's about to open.
Let's move 'em out.
You could just stay here and live in the castle.
You'd have your own wing where no one would ever complain about your stench or treat you bad ever again.
You could be happy.
I'm already happy.
I've got the coolest friend in the world.
And besides, I've got a job to do, too.
It may not be as fancy as being president but it's my duty.
And it's a big duty!
Ralph, are you coming, brother?
See you later, President Fart Feathers.
Au revoir,  Admiral Underpants.
And farewell, Baroness Boogerface.
Goodbye, Major Body Odor!
Hasta la vista,  you...
Ralph!
All right.
To be continued.
Yeah!
Hooray!
I'm gonna wreck it!
Hey!
Ralph's back!
Isn't that great!
The gang's all here!
So, I'm happy to report, and you'll be happy to hear, I'm taking life one game at a time.
All right!
Yeah, Ralph!
Of course, the job hasn't changed.
But, news flash, the Nicelanders are being nice to me!
And that got me thinking about those poor guys left without a game.
So here's what we did.
We're gonna wreck it!
We asked them to help us out on the bonus levels.
We can fix it!
I'm telling you, guys, we haven't been this popular in years.
It's crazy.
Wow!
The gamers say we're "retro," which I think means "old but cool." How come we never noticed this game?
And I decided that living in the dump wasn't making me feel very good, so I cleaned it up, built myself a little shack and a couple for the new guys, too.
Well, with a little help from Felix.
And guess who was the best man at his and Calhoun's wedding.
That's right, my friends, old Ham Hands himself.
Very elegant affair.
You should've seen it.
Lot of grandeur.
And not a single bug.
Let's just say, some tears were shed.
But I got to say, the best part of my day is when I get thrown off the roof.
Because when the Nicelanders lift me up, I get a perfect view of  Sugar Rush.
And I can see Vanellope racing.
Yes!
The kid's a natural.
And the players love her, glitch and all.
Just like I knew they would.
Turns out I don't need a medal to tell me I'm a good guy. 'Cause if that little kid likes me...
How bad can I be?
FLYNN".
This is the story of how I died.
But don't worry, this is a fun story, and the truth is, it isn't even mine.
This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel.
And it starts with the sun.
Once upon a time, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.
And from this small drop of sun grew a magic golden flower.
It had the ability to heal the sick and injured.
Oh, you see that old woman over there?
You might want to remember her.
She's kind of important.
Centuries passed and a hop, skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.
The kingdom was ruled by a beloved king and queen.
And the queen was about to have a baby.
But she got sick.
Really sick.
She was running out of time, and that's when people start to look for a miracle.
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.
Ah!
I told you she'd be important.
Instead of sharing the sun's gift, this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded its healing power and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.
And all she had to do was sing a special song.
Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine What once was mine You get the gist.
She sings to it, she turns young.
Creepy, right?
We found it!
The magic of the golden flower healed the queen.
A healthy baby girl, a princess was born, with beautiful golden hair.
FLYNN".
I'll give you a hint, that's Rapunzel.
To celebrate her birth, the king and queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.
And for that one moment, everything was perfect.
And then that moment ended.
Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine Make the clock...
Gothel broke into the castle, stole the child, and just like that, gone!
The kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the princess.
For deep within the forest, in a hidden tower, Gothel raised the child as her own.
Save what has been lost Bring back what once was mine What once was mine Gothel had found her new magic flower, but this time, she was determined to keep it hidden.
Why can't I go outside?
The outside world is a dangerous place, filled with horrible, selfish people.
You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
Yes, Mommy.
But the walls of that tower could not hide everything.
Each year, on her birthday, the king and queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky in hope that one day their lost princess would return.
Ha!
Hmm.
Well, I guess Pascal's not hiding out here.
Gotcha!
That's 22 for me.
How about 23 out of 45?
Okay.
Well, what do you want to do?
Yeah.
I don't think so.
I like it in here, and so do you.
Oh, come on, Pascal.
It's not so bad in there.
Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup Start on the chores And sweep till the floor's all clean Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up Sweep again and by then it's, like, 7:15 And so I'll read a book Or maybe two or three I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery I'll play guitar and knit and cook and basically Just wonder when will my life begin?
Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking Papier-méché, a bit of ballet and chess Pottery and ventriloquy, candle-making Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch Take a climb, sew a dress And I'll reread the books If I have time to spare I'll paint the walls some more I'm sure there's room somewhere And then I'll brush and brush and brush and brush my hair Stuck in the same place I've always been And I'll keep wondering and wondering and wondering and wondering When will my life begin?
Tomorrow night the lights will appear Just like they do on my birthday each year What is it like out there where they glow Now that I'm older Mother might just let me go Wow!
I could get used to a view like this.
Rider, come on!
Hold on.
Yep.
I'm used to it.
Guys, I want a castle.
We do this job, you can buy your own castle.
Hay fever?
Yeah.
Huh?
Wait!
Hey, wait!
Can't you picture me in a castle of my own?
Because I certainly can.
All the things we've seen, and it's only 8:00 in the morning!
Gentlemen, this is a very big day!
This is it!
This is a very big day, Pascal.
I'm finally going to do it.
I'm going to ask her.
Rapunzel!
Let down your hair!
It's time!
I know, I know.
Come on.
Don't let her see you.
Rapunzel!
I'm not getting any younger down here!
Coming, Mother!
Hi.
Welcome home, Mother.
Rapunzel, how you manage to do that every single day without fail.
It looks absolutely exhausting, darling.
Oh,  it's nothing.
Then I don't know why it takes so long.
Oh, darling, I'm just teasing.
All right.
So, Mother, as you know tomorrow is a very big day...
Rapunzel, look in that mirror.
You know what I see?
I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.
Oh, look, you're here, too.
I'm just teasing.
Stop taking everything so seriously.
Okay.
So, Mother, as I was saying, tomorrow is...
Rapunzel, Mother's feeling a little run-down.
Would you sing for me, dear?
Then we'll talk.
Oh!
Of course, Mother.
Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine Heal what has been hurt Change the Fates' design Save what has been lost Bring back what once was mine Rapunzel!
So, Mother, earlier I was saying tomorrow is a big day, and you didn't respond.
So, I'm just going to tell you, it's my birthday!
Ta-da!
No, no, no.
Can't be.
I distinctly remember.
Your birthday was last year.
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.
Mother, I'm turning 18, and I wanted to ask...
What I really want for this birthday...
Actually what I wanted for quite a few birthdays now...
Rapunzel, please, stop with the mumbling.
You know how I feel about the mumbling.
Blah-blah-blah-blah.
It's very annoying!
I'm just teasing.
You're adorable.
I love you so much, darling.
I want to see the floating lights.
What?
I was hoping you would take me to see the floating lights.
Oh!
You mean the stars.
That's the thing.
I've charted stars, and they're always constant.
But these, they appear every year on my birthday, Mother.
Only on my birthday.
And I can't help but feel like they're meant for me.
I need to see them, Mother.
And not just from my window, in person.
I have to know what they are.
You want to go outside?
Why, Rapunzel...
Look at you, as fragile as a flower Still a little sapling, just a sprout You know why we stay up in this tower I know, but...
That's right.
To keep you safe and sound, dear Guess I always knew this day was coming Knew that soon you'd want to leave the nest Soon but not yet Shh!
Trust me, pet Mother knows best Mother knows best Listen to your mother It's a scary world out there Mother knows best One way or another Something will go wrong I swear Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand Cannibals and snakes, the plague No!
Yes.
Also large bugs Men with pointy teeth And stop!
No more, you'll just upset me Mother's right here Mother will protect you Darling, here's what I suggest Skip the drama Stay with Mama Mother knows best Mother knows best Take it from your mumsy On your own, you won't survive Sloppy, underdressed Immature, clumsy Please, they'll eat you up alive Gullible, naive Positively grubby Ditsy and a bit...
Well, hmm, vague Plus, I believe, getting kind of chubby I'm just saying 'cause I wuv you Mother understands Mother's here to help you All I have is one request Rapunzel?
Yes?
Don't ever ask to leave this tower again.
Yes, Mother.
Oh.
I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Don't forget it You'll regret it Mother knows best Ta-ta!
I'll see you in a bit, my flower!
I'll be here.
Oh, no.
No,no,no,no,no.
This is bad.
This is very, very bad.
This is really bad.
They just can't get my nose right.
Who cares?
It's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.
All right.
Okay.
Give me a boost and I'll pull you up.
Give us the satchel first.
I just...
I can't believe that after all we've been through together, you don't trust me?
Ouch.
Now help us up, pretty boy!
Sorry, my hands are full.
What?
Rider!
Retrieve that satchel at any cost!
Yes, sir!
We got him now, Maximus.
Come on, fleabag!
Forward!
No.
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Give it to me!
Give me that!
Ha!
Alone at last.
Huh.
Huh? %GAsPs) Hmm.
Huh?
Okay, okay, okay.
I've got a person in my closet.
I've got a person in my closet.
I've got a person in my closet!
Too weak to handle myself out there, huh, Mother?
Well, tell that to my frying pan.
Huh?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Rapunzel!
Oh!
Let down your hair!
One moment, Mother!
I have a big surprise!
Uh...
I do, too!
Ooh, I bet my surprise is bigger!
I seriously doubt it.
I brought back parsnips.
I'm going to make hazelnut soup for dinner.
Your favorite.
Surprise!
Well, Mother, there's something I want to tell you.
Oh, Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight.
Especially when I've clone absolutely nothing wrong.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said earlier.
I hope you're not still talking about the stars. "Floating lights," and, yes, I'm leading up to that.
Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart.
No, Mother, I'm just saying, you think I'm not strong enough to handle myself out there.
Oh, I know you're not strong enough to handle yourself out there.
But if you just...
We're done talking about this.
Trust me!
I know what I'm...
Rapunzel.
Oh, come on!
Enough with the lights!
You are not leaving this tower!
Ever!
Great.
Now I'm the bad guy.
All I was going to say, Mother, is that...
I know what I want for my birthday now.
And what is that?
New paint.
The paint made from the white shells you once brought me.
That is a very long trip, Rapunzel.
Almost three days' time.
I just thought it was a better idea than the stars.
You'll be all right on your own?
I know I'm safe as long as I'm here.
I'll be back in three days' time.
I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Okay.
Huh.
Huh?
What...
FLYNNI Is this hair?
Struggling...
Struggling is pointless.
Huh?
I know why you're here, and I'm not afraid of you.
What?
Who are you?
And how did you find me?
Who are you, and how did you find me?
I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you.
But may I just say...
Hi.
How you doing?
The name's Flynn Rider.
How's your day going?
Huh?
Who else knows my location, Flynn Rider?
All right, blondie.
Rapunzel.
Gesundheit.
Here's the deal.
I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest.
I came across your tower and...
Oh!
Oh, no.
Where is my satchel?
I've hidden it.
Somewhere you'll never find it.
It's in that pot, isn't it?
Huh?
Would you stop that?
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.
So, what do you want with my hair?
To cut it?
What?
Sell it?
No!
Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair is to get out of it, literally.
You...
Wait.
You don't want my hair?
Why on earth would I want your hair?
Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it.
End of story.
You're telling the truth?
Yes!
Hmm.
I know.
I need someone to take me.
I think he's telling the truth, too.
He doesn't have fangs.
But what choice do I have?
Okay, Flynn Rider, I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
Deal?
Look this way.
Do you know what these are?
You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?
Lanterns?
I knew they weren't stars.
Well, tomorrow evening, they will light the night sky with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely.
Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you.
That is my deal.
Yeah.
No can do.
Unfortunately the kingdom and I aren't exactly simpatico at the moment, so I won't be taking you anywhere.
Something brought you here, Flynn Rider.
Call it what you will, fate, destiny...
A horse.
So I have made the decision to trust you.
A horrible decision, really.
But trust me when I tell you this.
You can tear this tower apart brick by brick, but without my help, you will never find your precious satchel.
Let me get this straight.
I take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home, and you'll give me back my satchel?
I promise.
And when I promise something, I never, ever break that promise.
Even All right, listen.
I didn't want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice.
Here comes the smolder.
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.
Fine!
I'll take you to see the lanterns.
Really?
Oops.
You broke my smolder.
Are you coming, blondie?
Look at the world so close And I'm halfway to it Look at it all so big Do I even dare Look at me, there at last I just have to do it Should I?
No Here I go Just smell the grass, the dirt Just like I dreamed they'd be Just feel that summer breeze The way it's calling me For, like, the first time ever I'm completely free I could go running and racing And dancing and chasing And leaping and bounding Hair flying, heart pounding And splashing and reeling and finally feeling That's when my life begins I can't believe I did this!
I can't believe I did this.
I can't believe I did this!
Mother would be so furious.
But that's okay.
What she doesn't know won't kill her, right?
Oh, my gosh!
This would kill her.
This is so fun!
I am a horrible daughter.
I'm going back.
I am never going back!
I am a despicable human being!
Best day ever!
You know, I can't help but notice you seem a little at war with yourself here.
What?
I'm only picking up bits and pieces.
Overprotective mother, forbidden road trip.
This is serious stuff.
But let me ease your conscience.
This is part of growing up.
A little rebellion, a little adventure, that's good.
Healthy, even.
You think?
I know.
You're way over-thinking this, trust me.
Does your mother deserve it?
No.
Would this break her heart and crush her soul?
Of course.
But you've got to do it. "Break her heart"?
In half. "Crush her soul"?
Like a grape.
She would be heartbroken.
You're right.
I am, aren't I?
Oh, bother.
All right.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm letting you out of the deal.
What?
That's right, but don't thank me.
Let's turn around and get you home.
Here's your pan, here's your frog.
I get back my satchel, you get back a mother-daughter relationship based on mutual trust, and voila', we part ways as unlikely friends.
No.
I am seeing those lanterns.
Oh, come on!
What is it going to take for me to get my satchel back?
I will use this.
Is it ruffians?
Thugs?
Have they come for me?
Stay calm.
It can probably smell fear.
On!
Sorry.
Guess I'm just a little bitjumpy.
Probably be best if we avoid ruffians and thugs, though. (CHUCKLES SELF-CONSCIOUSLY) Yeah, that would probably be best.
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.
Where?
Oh, don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.
A palace horse.
Where's your rider?
Rapunzel.
Rapunzel!
Rapunzel!
Let down your hair!
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel!
I know it's around here somewhere.
Ah, there it is!
The Snuggly Duckling.
Don't worry.
Very quaint place.
Perfect for you.
Don't want you scaring and giving up on this whole endeavor now, do we?
Well, I do like ducklings.
Yay!
Gargon, your finest table, please!
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.
Really let that seep in.
What are you getting?
To me, it's part man-smell and the other part is really bad man-smell.
I don't know why, but overall it smells like the color brown.
Your thoughts?
That's a lot of hair.
She's growing it out.
Is that blood in your mustache?
Goldie, look at all the blood in his mustache!
Good sir, that's a lot of blood!
You don't look so good, blondie.
Maybe we should get you home, call it a day.
Probably better off.
This is a five-star joint.
If you can't handle this place, maybe you should be back in your tower.
Is this you?
Now they're just being mean.
It's him, all right.
Greno, go find some guards.
That reward is going to buy me a new hook.
I could use the money.
What about me?
I'm broke!
Get back!
Mine!
Ruffians, stop!
We can work this out!
Hey!
Leave him alone!
Gentlemen, please!
Give me back my guide!
Ruffians!
Not the nose!
Not the nose!
Put him down!
I don't know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns because I've been dreaming about them my entire life!
Find your humanity!
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?
I had a dream once.
I'm malicious, mean and scary My sneer could curdle dairy And violence-wise my hands are not the cleanest But despite my evil look And my temper and my hook I've always yearned to be a concert pianist Can't you see me on the stage performing Mozart Tickling the ivories till they gleam Yep, I'd rather be called deadly For my killer show tune medley Thank you! 'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream He's got a dream He's got a dream See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem Though I do like breaking femurs You can count me with the dreamers Like everybody else I've got a dream I've got scars and lumps and bruises Plus something here that oozes And let's not even mention my complexion But despite my extra toes And my goiter and my nose I really want to make a love connection Can't you see me with a special little lady?
Rowing in a rowboat down the stream Though I'm one disgusting blighter I'm a lover not a fighter 'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream - I've got a dream He's got a dream - I've got a dream He's got a dream And I know one day romance will reign supreme Though my face leaves people screaming There's a child behind it dreaming Like everybody else, I've got a dream Thor would like to quit and be a florist Gunther does interior design - Ulf is into mime Attila's cupcakes are sublime Bruiser knits, Killer sews Fang does little puppet shows And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns What about you?
I'm sorry, me?
What's your dream?
No, no, no.
Sorry, boys.
I don't sing.
I have dreams like you No, really Just much less touchy-feely They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny On an island that I own Tanned and rested and alone Surrounded by enormous piles of money - I've got a dream She's got a dream - I've got a dream She's got a dream I just want to see the floating lanterns gleam And with every passing hour I'm so glad I left my tower Like all you lovely folks I've got a dream She's got a dream He's got a dream They've got a dream We've got a dream So our differences ain't really that extreme We're one big team - Call us brutal Sick - Sadistic And grotesquely optimistic 'Cause way down deep inside we've got a dream - I've got a dream I've got a dream Yes, way down deep inside I've got a dream I found the guards!
Where's Rider?
Where is he?
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him.
Turn the place upside down if you have to!
Go.
Live your dream.
I will.
Your dream stinks.
I was talking to her.
Thanks for everything.
Ibefieve this is the man you're looking for.
You got me!
Sir, there's no sign of Rider.
Maximus!
What's he doing?
A passage!
Come on, men.
Let's go.
Conli!
Make sure those boys don't get away.
Play it safe or go get the crown?
I got a dream I got some dreams Oh!
Somebody get me a glass!
Because I just found me a tall drink of water.
Oh, stop it, you big lug.
Where does that tunnel let out?
Knife!
I didn't know you had that in you back there.
That was pretty impressive.
I know!
I know.
So...
Flynn?
Where are you from?
Whoa!
Sorry, blondie, I don't do back-story.
However, I am becoming very interested in yours.
I know I'm not supposed to mention the hair.
Nope.
Or the mother.
Uh-uh.
I'm too scared to ask about the frog.
Chameleon.
Nuance.
Here's my question, though, if you want to see the lanterns so badly why haven't you gone before?
Uh...
Well...
Uh, Flynn?
Flynn?
Rider?
Run.
Run!
Who's that?
They don't like me.
Who's that?
They don't like me either.
Who's that?
Let's assume that everyone in here doesn't like me.
Here. {CHUCKUNG) 4GASPS) I waited a long time for this.
Oh, mama!
I have got to get me one of these!
Ha!
You should know that this is the strangest thing I've ever done!
How about two out of three?
Flynn!
Flynn, look out!
Ha!
You should see your faces, because you look... ...ridiculous.
Come on, blondie!
Jump!
It's no use.
I can't see anything.
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch-black down there.
This is all my fault.
She was right.
I never should have done this.
I'm so...
I'm so sorry, Flynn.
Eugene.
What?
My real name is Eugene Fitzherbert.
Someone might as well know.
I have magic hair that glows when I sing.
What?
I have magic hair that glows when I sing!
Flower gleam and glow Let your power shine (BOTH couemwe) We made it.
Her hair glows.
We're alive.
I'm alive!
I didn't see that coming.
Eugene?
The hair actually glows.
Why does her hair glow?
Eugene!
What?
It doesn't just glow.
Why is he smiling at me? (MEN couemwe) (couemwe) I'll kill him.
I'll kill that Rider!
We'll cut him off at the kingdom and get back the crown.
Come on!
GOTHELI Or...
Perhaps you want to stop acting like wild dogs chasing their tails and think for a moment.
Oh, please, there's no need for that.
Well, if that's all you desire, then be on your way.
I was going to offer you something worth 1,000 crowns.
Would have made you rich beyond belief, and that wasn't even the best part.
Oh, well.
C'est Ia vie.
Enjoy your crown!
What's the best part?
It comes with revenge on Flynn Rider.
You're being strangely cryptic as you wrap your magic hair around my injured hand.
Sorry.
Just don't...
Don't freak out.
Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine Heal what has been hurt Change the Fates' design Save what has been lost Bring back what once was mine What once was mine Please don't freak out!
I'm not freaking out.
Are you freaking out?
I'm just interested in your hair and the magical qualities it possesses.
How long has it been doing that exactly?
Forever, I guess.
Mother says when I was a baby, people tried to cut it.
They wanted to take it for themselves.
But once it's cut, it turns brown and loses its power.
A gift like that, it has to be protected.
That's why Mother never let me...
That's why I never left and...
You never left that tower.
And you're still going to go back?
No!
Yes.
It's complicated.
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?
Ah, yeah.
Well...
I'll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert.
It's a little bit of a downer.
There was this book I used to read every night to all the younger kids.
The Tales of Flynnagan Rider.
Swashbuckling rogue, richest man alive, not bad with the ladies either.
Not that he'd ever brag about it, of course.
Was he a thief, too?
Uh...
Well, no.
He had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do.
He could go anywhere that he wanted to go.
And for a kid with nothing, I don't know, I...
Just seemed like the better option.
You can't tell anyone about this, okay?
It could ruin my whole reputation.
Ah.
We wouldn't want that.
A fake reputation is all a man has.
Well, I should...
I should get some more firewood.
Hey.
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than Flynn Rider.
Well.
Then you'd be the first.
But thank you.
Well, I thought he'd never leave.
Mother?
Hello, dear. (RAPUNZEL STAMMERING NERVOUSLY) How did you find me?
Oh, it was easy, really.
I just listened for the sound of complete and utter betrayal and followed that.
Mother...
We're going home.
Now.
You don't understand.
I've been on this incredible journey, and I've seen and learned so much.
I even met someone.
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.
Come on.
Mother, wait.
I think...
I think he likes me.
Likes you?
Please, Rapunzel, that's demented!
This is why you never should have left Dear, this whole romance that you've invented Just proves you're too naive to be here Why would he like you?
Come on now, really Look at you!
You think that he's impressed?
Don't be a dummy, come with Mummy Mother...
No!
No?
Oh, I see how it is Rapunzel knows best Rapunzel's so mature now Such a clever grown-up miss Rapunzel knows best Fine, if you're so sure now - Go ahead, then give him this!
How did you...
This is why he's here Don't let him deceive you Give it to him, watch, you'll see I will!
Trust me, my dear That's how fast he'll leave you I won't say I told you so No, Rapunzel knows best So, if he's such a dreamboat Go and put him to the test Mother, wait!
If he's lying, don't come crying Mother knows best So, can I ask you something?
Is there any chance that I'm going to get super strength in my hand?
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.
Hey, you all right?
Oh!
Sorry, yes.
Just lost in thought, I guess.
Here's the thing, superhuman good looks, I've always had them.
Born with it.
But superhuman strength.
Can you imagine the possibilities of this?
Patience, boys.
All good things to those who wait.
Huh?
Well, I hope you're here to apologize.
No, put me down.
Stop it!
No!
Let me go!
Give me him!
Stop, stop, stop!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, boy.
Easy!
Settle down.
Easy, boy.
Easy.
Easy.
That's it.
Now sit. sit; What?
Now drop the boot.
Drop it. (coonue) Aw!
You're such a good boy!
Yes, you are!
You all tired from chasing this bad man all over the place?
Excuse me?
Nobody appreciates you, do they?
Do they?
Oh, come on.
He's a bad horse!
Oh, he's nothing but a big sweetheart.
Isn't that right...
Maximus?
You've got to be kidding me.
Look.
Today is kind of the biggest day of my life, and the thing is, I need you not to get him arrested.
Just for 24 hours, and then you can chase each other to your heart's content.
Okay?
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Thank you!
It's for the lost princess.
To the boats!
Hey, Max!
What?
I bought them.
Most of them.
Where are we going?
Best day of your life?
I figured you should have a decent seat.
You Okay?
I'm terrified.
Why?
I've been looking out a window for 18 years, dreaming about what it might feel like when those lights rise in the sky.
What if it's not everything that I dreamed it would be?
It Will be.
And what if it is?
What do I do then?
That's the good part, I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.
All those days watching from the windows All those years, outside looking in All that time, never even knowing Just how blind I've been Now I'm here, blinking in the starlight Now I'm here, suddenly I see Standing here, it's, oh, so clear I'm where I'm meant to be And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright And the world has somehow shifted All at once, everything looks different Now that I see you I have something for you, too.
I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared.
And the thing is, I'm not scared anymore.
You know what I mean?
I'm starting to.
FLYNN".
All those days chasing down a daydream All those years, living in a blur All that time, never truly seeing Things the way they were Now she's here, shining in the starlight Now she's here, suddenly I know If she's here, it's crystal clear I'm where I'm meant to go And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright And the world has somehow shifted All at once, everything is different Now that I see you Now that I... see you ls everything okay?
Huh?
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
I just...
I'm sorry.
Everything is fine.
There's just something I have to take care of.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
It's all right, Pascal.
Ah!
There you are!
I've been searching everywhere for you guys since we got separated.
The sideburns are coming in nice, huh?
Got to be excited about that.
Anyhow, I just wanted to say I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.
I'll miss you, but I think it's for the best Holding out on us again, eh, Rider?
What?
We heard you found something.
Something much more valuable than a crown.
We want her instead.
I was starting to think you ran off with the crown and left me.
He did.
What?
No.
He wouldn't.
See for yourself.
Eugene?
Eugene!
A fair trade.
A crown for the girl with the magic hair.
How much do you think someone would pay to stay young and healthy forever?
No.
Please.
No!
No!
Rapunzel!
Mother?
Oh, my precious girl!
Mother.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
How did you...
I was so worried about you, dear.
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you and...
Oh, my.
Let's go before they come to!
You were right, Mother.
You were right about everything.
I know, darling.
I know.
Look!
The crown!
Rapunzel.
Rapunzel!
No!
Wait, guys!
Rapunzel!
Let's get this over with, Rider.
Where are we going?
Oh.
There.
It never happened.
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazelnut soup.
I really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you what was out there.
The world is dark and selfish and cruel.
If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine, it destroys it.
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!
It wasn't us!
It was the old lady!
Om lady?
Wait.
No!
Wait!
You don't understand!
She's in trouble!
Wait!
Rapunzel?
What's going on up there?
Are you all right?
I'm the lost princess.
Please speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.
I am the lost princess.
Aren't I?
Did I mumble, Mother?
Or should I even call you that?
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?
Why would you ask such a ridiculous question?
It was you!
It was all you!
Everything I did was to protect you.
Rapunzel!
I've spent my entire life hiding from people who would use me for my power...
Rapunzel! ...when I should have been hiding from you!
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.
What did you do to him?
That criminal is to be hanged for his crimes.
No.
Now, now, it's all right.
Listen to me.
All of this is as it should be.
No!
You were wrong about the world.
And you were wrong about me!
And I will never let you use my hair again!
You want me to be the bad guy?
Fine, now I'm the bad guy.
What's this?
Open up!
What's the password?
What?
Nope.
Open this door!
Not even close!
You have three seconds!
One...
Two...
Three.
Huh?
Frying pans!
Who knew, right?
Head down.
Head down.
Arms in.
Arms in.
Knees apart.
Knees apart.
Knees apart?
Why do I need to keep my knees apart...
Max!
You brought them here?
Thank you.
No, really.
Thank you.
I feel maybe this whole time, we've just been misunderstanding one another, and we're really just...
You're right, we should go.
Max?
Max!
Max!
Okay, Max.
Let's see how fast you can run.
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel, let down your hair!
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never see you again.
Huh?
Now look what you've done, Rapunzel.
Oh, don't worry, dear.
Our secret will die with him.
And as for us...
We are going where no one will ever find you again.
Rapunzel, really!
Enough already!
Stop fighting me!
No!
I won't stop!
For every minute of the rest of my life, I will fight!
I will never stop trying to get away from you!
But if you let me save him, I will go with you.
No!
No, Rapunzel.
I'll never run.
I'll never try to escape.
Just let me heal him and you and I will be together, forever, just like you want.
Everything will be the way it was.
I promise.
Just like you want.
Just let me heal him.
In case you get any ideas about following us. (couemwe) Eugene! (couemwe) I'm so sorry.
Everything is going to be okay, though.
No, Rapunzel.
I promise.
You have to trust me.
Come on.
Just breathe.
I can't let you do this.
And I can't let you die.
But if you do then you will die.
Hey.
It's going to be all right.
Rapunzel.
Wait.
Eugene...
No!
What have you done?
What have you done?
No!
No!No.No!
No,no,no.Eugene.
No!
Look at me.
I'm right here.
Don't go.
Stay with me.
Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine Rapunzel.
What?
You were my new dream.
And you were mine.
Heal what has been hurt Change the Fates' design Save what has been lost Bring back what once was mine What once was mine Rapunzel?
Eugene?
Did I ever tell you I've got a thing for brunettes?
Eugene!
FLYNN".
Well, you can imagine what happened next.
The kingdom rejoiced, for their lost princess had returned.
The party lasted an entire week, and honestly I don't remember most of it.
Dreams came true all over the place.
That guy went on to become the most famous concert pianist in the world, if you can believe it!
And this guy?
He eventually found true love.
As for this guy, I assume he's happy.
He's never told me otherwise.
Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom disappeared almost overnight.
As did most of the apples.
Pascal never changed.
At last Rapunzel was home.
And she finally had a real family.
She was a princess worth waiting for.
Beloved by all, she led her kingdom with all the grace and wisdom that her parents did before her.
And, as for me, I started going by Eugene again, stopped thieving and turned it all around.
But I know what the big question is.
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?
I'm pleased to tell you that after years and years of asking and asking and asking...
I finally said yes.
RAPUNZEL'.
Eugene.
FLYNN".
All right, I asked her.
RAPUNZEL".
And we're living happily ever after.
Yes, we are.
English - US - SDH
Read the charges.
Dr.
Jumba Jookiba, lead scientist of Galaxy Defense Industries, you stand before this council accused of illegal genetic experimentation.
How do you plead?
Not guilty!
My experiments are only theoretical, completely within legal boundaries.
We believe you actually created something.
Created something?
But that would be irresponsible and unethical.
I would never, ever, make more than one.
What is that monstrosity?
Monstrosity?
What you see before you is the first of a new species.
I call it Experiment 626.
He is bulletproof, fireproof and can think faster than supercomputer.
He can see in the dark and move objects 3,000 times his size.
His only instinct, to destroy everything he touches!
So it is a monster.
Hey, just a little one.
It is an affront to nature.
It must be destroyed!
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.
Experiment 626, give us some sign you understand any of this.
Show us that there is something inside you that is good.
So naughty!
I didn't teach it that.
Place that idiot scientist under arrest!
I prefer to be called "evil genius"!
And as for that abomination, it is the flawed product of a deranged mind.
It has no place among us.
Captain Gantu, take him away.
With pleasure.
Uncomfortable?
Good!
The council has banished you to exile on a desert asteroid.
So relax, enjoy the trip, and don't get any ideas.
These guns are locked onto your genetic signature.
They won't shoot anyone but you.
Why, you...
May I remind the Captain that he is on duty?
Secure the cell!
Aye, Captain.
Captain on deck.
All ahead full.
Does this look infected to you?
Quiet, you.
Gunfire in the cell bay!
Open a channel.
He's loose on Deck C!
Red alert.
Seal off the deck!
Security, converge on Door 7!
Deadly force authorized.
Fire on sight!
Fire on sight!
There he is!
Security to Bridge.
It's in the ventilation system.
He's headed for the power grid.
What was that?
I don't think he's on the ship anymore.
Confirmed.
He's taken a police cruiser.
Yeah, he took the red one.
That's it!
We've got it.
We've got it!
Hyperdrive activated.
System charging.
He's engaged his H-drive!
Warning, guidance is not functional.
Pursuit Commander, that crazy trog is about to make a jump!
Break formation!
Get clear of that ship!
Navigation failure.
Do not engage...
Get me Galactic Control.
Where is he?
He's still in hyperspace.
Where will he exit?
Calculating now.
Quadrant 17, section 005, area 51.
A planet called Ee-arth.
I want an expert on this planet in here now!
What is that?
Water.
Most of the planet is covered in it.
He won't survive in water.
His molecular density is too great.
No.
Of course.
How much time do we have?
We have projected his landing at three hours, 42 minutes.
We have to gas the planet.
Hold it!
Hold everything!
Earth is a protected wildlife reserve.
Yeah.
We've been using it to rebuild the mosquito population, which, need I remind you, is an endangered species!
Am I to assume you are the expert?
I don't know about "expert." Agent Pleakley at your service.
Can we not simply destroy the island?
No!
Crazy head!
The mosquito's food of choice, primitive humanoid life forms, have colonies all over that planet.
Are they intelligent?
No, but they're very delicate.
In fact, every time an asteroid strikes their planet, they have to begin life all over.
It's fascinating, isn't it?
With this, I've been able to study...
What if our military forces just landed there?
Well, that'd be a bad idea!
These are extremely simple creatures, miss.
Landing there would create mass mayhem and planet-wide panic!
A quiet capture would require an understanding of 626 that we do not possess.
Who, then, Mr.
Pleakley, would you send for his extraction?
Does he have a brother?
Close grandmother, perhaps?
Friendly cousin?
Neighbor with a beard?
He got away?
I'm sure this comes as no surprise to you.
I designed this creature for to be unstoppable.
Which is precisely why you must now bring him back.
What, me?
And to reward you, we are willing to trade your freedom for his capture. 626 will not come easily.
Maybe direct hit from plasma cannon might stun him long enough to...
Plasma cannon granted.
Do we have a bargain, Dr.
Jumba?
But it's a delicate planet!
Who's going to control him?
You will.
Very good, Your Highness.
I didn't quite...
You're not joking!
So, tell me, my little one-eyed one, on what poor, pitiful, defenseless planet has my monstrosity been unleashed?
Stop.
Stop.
Lilo, why are you all wet?
It's sandwich day.
Every Thursday, I take Pudge the fish a peanut-butter sandwich.
Pudge is a fish?
And today we were out of peanut butter.
So I asked my sister what to give him, and she said a tuna sandwich.
I can't give Pudge tuna!
Do you know what tuna is?
Fish?
It's fish!
If I gave Pudge tuna, I'd be an abomination!
I'm late because I had to go to the store and get peanut butter, 'cause all we have is stinking tuna!
Lilo, Lilo, why is this so important?
Pudge controls the weather.
You're crazy.
Please!
Please!
Everybody calm down!
Girls.
Lilo...
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I won't do it again!
Maybe we should call your sister.
No!
I'll be good!
I want to dance.
I practiced.
I just want to dance.
I practiced.
She bit me.
I called your sister.
She said to wait for her here on the porch.
We'll try again on Sunday.
Does this look infected to you?
Yeah.
You better not have rabies.
If you have rabies, the dogcatcher is going to have to cut...
Are you going to play dolls?
You don't have a doll.
This is Scrump.
I made her, but her head is too big.
So I pretend a bug laid eggs in her ears, and she's upset, because she only has a few more days to...
Lilo!
Lilo?
Lilo?
Oh, no.
You better be home.
Hey!
Watch where you're going!
Stupid head!
Lilo!
Lilo!
Open the door, Lilo!
Go away.
Lilo?
We don't have time for this.
Leave me alone to die.
Come on, Lilo, that social worker's going to be here any minute!
You are so finished when I get in there!
I'm going to stuff you in the blender, push "purée," then bake you into a pie and feed it to the social worker!
And when he says, "This is great.
What's your secret?" I'm going to say, "Love and nurturing." Hi.
You must be the...
The stupid head.
You know, I'm really sorry about that, and if I'd known who you were, of course I never would've...
I can pay for that.
It's a rental.
Are you the guardian in question?
Yes.
I'm Nani.
Nice to meet you, Mister...
Bubbles.
Mr.
Bubbles.
That's a strange...
Yes, I know.
Are you going to invite me in, Nani?
I thought we could sit out here and talk.
I don't think so.
Right.
This way.
Wait here.
Hey!
So, lemonade?
Do you often leave your sister home alone?
No.
Never.
Well, except for just now.
I had to run to the store to get some...
You left the stove on while you were out?
Low heat!
Just a simmer.
It's coming along great.
I found that this morning.
Lilo!
There you are.
Honey face, this is Mr.
Bubbles.
Nice to meet you.
Your knuckles say "Cobra." Cobra Bubbles.
You don't look like a social worker.
I'm a special classification.
Did you ever kill anyone?
We're getting off the subject.
Let's talk about you.
Are you happy?
I'm adjusted.
I eat four food groups and look both ways before crossing the street and take long naps and get disciplined.
Disciplined?
Yeah.
She disciplines me real good.
Sometimes five times a day.
No.
With bricks.
Bricks?
In a pillowcase.
Okay!
That's enough sugar for you.
Why don't you run along, you little cutie?
The other social workers just thought she was a scream.
Thirsty?
Let me illuminate to you the precarious situation in which you have found yourself.
I am the one they call when things go wrong, and things have indeed gone wrong.
My friends need to be punished.
Call me next time you're left here alone.
Yep.
In case you're wondering, this did not go well.
You have three days to change my mind.
Lilo!
Why didn't you wait at the school?
You were supposed to wait there!
Lilo!
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?
Answer me!
No!
No, you don't understand?
No!
No, what?
No!
You're such a pain!
So why don't you sell me and buy a rabbit instead?
At least a rabbit would behave better than you!
Go ahead!
Then you'll be happy, because it'll be smarter than me, too!
And quieter!
You'll like it, 'cause it's stinky, like you!
Go to your room!
I'm already in my room!
Hey.
I brought you some pizza, in case you were hungry.
We're a broken family, aren't we?
No.
Maybe a little.
Maybe a lot.
I shouldn't have yelled at you.
We're sisters.
It's our job.
Yeah, well, from now on...
I like you better as a sister than a mom.
Yeah?
And you like me better as a sister than a rabbit, right?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.
You hit her?
Before I bit her.
You bit her.
Lilo, you shouldn't...
People treat me different.
They just don't know what to say.
I'll tell you what.
If you promise not to fight anymore, I promise not to yell at you, except on special occasions.
Tuesdays and bank holidays would be good.
Yeah?
Would that be good?
My camera's full again.
Aren't they beautiful?
A falling star!
I call it!
Get out!
Get out!
I have to make a wish!
Can't you go any faster?
Oh, no!
Gravity is increasing on me.
No, it's not!
It is, too, Lilo.
The same thing happened yesterday.
You rotten sister!
Your butt is crushing me!
Why do you act so weird?
It's me again.
I need someone to be my friend, someone who won't run away.
Maybe send me an angel, the nicest angel you have.
What we when hit?
There it is.
It stayed jammed under the fender.
We better call somebody.
We're looking for something that can defend itself, something that won't die, something sturdy, you know?
Like a lobster.
Lilo, you                 lolo.
Do we have a lobster door?
No.
We have a dog door.
We are getting a dog.
So nice to see your pretty face again!
Jumba?
We need your name and address at the bottom of the form...
The kennel's back this way.
Go.
Pick someone out.
Hello?
Hello?
Are there any "aminals" in here?
Hello!
Hi.
Hi.
Wow!
Yes.
All of our dogs are adoptable.
Except that one!
What is that thing?
A dog, I think, but it was dead this morning.
It was dead this morning?
Well, we thought it was dead.
It was hit by a truck.
I like him!
Come here, boy.
Wouldn't you like a different dog?
We have better dogs, dear.
Not better than him.
He can talk!
Say hello.
Dogs can't talk, dear.
He did.
Does it have to be this dog?
Yes, he's good.
I can tell.
You'll have to think of a name for him.
His name is Stitch.
Now, that's not a real name in Iceland, but here it's a good name.
Stitch it is.
And there's a $2 license fee.
I want to buy him!
Can I borrow $2?
He's all yours.
You're all mine.
Well, what's he doing?
Keep quiet.
He's listening for us.
How good is his hearing?
I mean, can he...
Why don't you run?
Coming!
I'm coming!
Stop!
I have just determined this situation to be far too hazardous!
Don't worry, I won't hit her.
No!
That girl is a part of the mosquito food chain.
Here!
Educate yourself.
Using a little girl for a shield.
This is low even for you!
Tear him apart with all both my bare hands!
Have you lost your mind?
What is it, Stitch?
We cannot be seen!
Bad dog, barking at nothing!
You can't shoot, and you can't be seen.
Look at you!
You look like a monster.
We have to blend in.
Okay, I got to get to work.
Stick around town and stay out of the roads, okay?
I'll meet you at 1:00.
Okay, I guess we should be going.
What about Stitch?
My friends!
What do you want?
I'm sorry I bit you and pulled your hair and punched you in the face.
Apology not accepted.
Now get out of my way before I run you over.
I got a new dog.
His name is Stitch.
That is the ugliest thing I have ever saw.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Get it away from me!
I'm gonna get a disease!
Somebody do something!
Oh, great!
He's loose.
His destructive programming is taking effect.
He will be irresistibly drawn to large cities where he will back up sewers, reverse street signs and steal everyone's left shoe.
It's nice to live on an island with no large cities.
Are you okay?
Hey, over here, little buddy.
When you're ready to give up, just let us know.
Yeah!
This is you.
This is your badness level.
It's unusually high for someone your size.
We have to fix that.
Lilo!
Your dog cannot sit at the table.
Stitch is troubled.
He needs desserts.
You didn't even eat your sweet potato.
I thought you liked them.
Desserts!
David!
I got a new dog.
You sure it's a dog?
He used to be a collie before he got ran over.
Hey.
How's it, Nani?
Did you catch fire again?
Nah, just the stage.
Listen, I was wondering if you're not doing anything this...
David, I told you, I can't.
I...
I got a lot to deal with right now.
I know.
I just figured you might need some time...
You smell like a lawn mower.
Look, I got to go.
The kid at Table 3's throwing                 poi                 again.
Maybe some other time, okay?
Don't worry.
She likes your butt and fancy hair.
I know.
I read her diary.
She thinks it's fancy?
Look what I find!
Get restraints!
Right.
Take that!
Hurry!
Hold still just a...
Hey, Nani!
Is that your dog?
All is well.
Please, go about your business.
I'm okay.
Your head looks swollen.
Actually, she's just ugly.
Darling.
He's joking.
Ugly, look at me.
This is not working out.
But...
Yeah?
Well, who wants to work at this stupid fakey                 luau                 anyway?
Come on, Lilo.
Did you lose your job because of Stitch and me?
Nah.
The manager's a vampire, and he wanted me to join his legion of the undead.
I knew it.
This is a great home.
You'll like it a lot.
See?
Lilo...
Comfy.
Hey!
Hey!
What is the matter with you?
Be careful of the little angel!
It's not an angel, Lilo.
I don't even think it's a dog.
We just have to take him back.
He's just cranky because it's his bedtime.
He's creepy, Lilo.
I won't sleep knowing he's loose in the house.
You're loose in the house all the time, and I sleep just fine!
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop that, Stitch!
Hey!
Look at him, Lilo.
He's obviously mutated from something else.
We have to take him back.
He was an orphan, and we adopted him!
What about                 'ohana?
He hasn't been here that long.
Neither have I.
Dad said                 'ohana                 means "family." 'Ohana                 means "family." "Family" means...
Nobody gets left behind.
Or?
Or forgotten.
I know.
I know.
I hate it when you use                 'ohana                 against me.
Don't worry, you can sleep right next to me.
Look how curious the puppy is.
This is my room, and this is your bed.
This is your dolly and bottle.
See?
Doesn't spill.
I filled it with coffee.
Good puppy.
Now get into bed.
Hey!
That's mine!
Down!
Be careful of that!
You don't touch this!
Don't ever touch it!
No!
Don't pull on her head!
She's recovering from surgery.
No!
That's from my blue period.
There.
You know, you wreck everything you touch.
Why not try and make something for a change?
Wow.
San Francisco.
Save me!
No more caffeine for you.
This little girl is wasting her time. 626 cannot be taught to ignore its destructive programming.
Push that over.
What are you doing?
Nothing!
Say, I want to try it on.
No!
Share!
Hey!
You're just jealous 'cause I'm pretty!
Don't move.
A mosquito has chosen me as her perch.
She's so beautiful.
Look, another one.
And another one!
Why, it's a whole flock.
And they like me!
They're nuzzling my flesh with their noses.
Now, they're, they're...
I think it might be a koala, an evil koala.
I can't even pet it.
It keeps staring at me, like it's going to eat me.
Hello?
Nani?
Hello?
Are you there?
Now, this is interesting.
What? 626 was designed to be a monster, but now he has nothing to destroy.
You see, I never gave him a greater purpose.
What must it be like to have nothing, not even memories to visit in the middle of the night?
Nah!
That's the Ugly Duckling.
See?
He's sad because he's all alone and nobody wants him.
But on this page, his family hears him crying and they find him.
Then the Ugly Duckling is happy, because he knows where he belongs.
Want to listen to the King?
You look like an Elvis fan.
Nani.
Nani!
Yeah?
Look.
Heard you lost your job.
Well, actually, I just quit that job, because, you know, the hours are just not conducive to the challenges of raising a child...
Hey!
I am so sorry about that.
What is that thing?
That's my puppy.
Really?
Thus far, you have been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience, but I cannot ignore you being jobless.
Do I make myself clear?
Perfectly.
And next time I see this dog, I expect it to be a model citizen,                 capisce?
Yes?
New job.
Model citizen.
Good day.
Mrs.
Hasagawa?
I'm here to answer your newspaper ad.
Elvis Presley was a model citizen.
I've compiled a list of his traits for you to practice.
Number one is dancing.
I can't talk now, dear.
I'm waiting for someone to answer my ad.
That's why I'm here.
Hands on your hips.
Now follow my lead.
That's my want ad.
I know!
Why is everything so dark?
I am all about coffee.
Let's move on to step two.
Elvis played guitar.
Here.
Hold it like this, and put your fingers here.
See?
Now you try.
And I make great cappuccinos and lattes with...
I wish I could, Nani, but I just hired Teddy, and with tourist season ending...
Concierge-er-ing is my life.
I just love to answer phones...
This is the face of romance.
She looks like she could use some loving.
We might have something.
Good.
Now kiss her.
I'm sure Elvis had his bad days, too.
I'm all about saving people.
Actually, I do think we have an opening.
Really?
Okay, this is it.
Time to bring it all together.
That'd be so great!
You have no idea how badly I need this job.
It's all you!
Knock them dead!
Don't crowd him!
Hey, knock it off!
Hey, Lilo!
How's it, Nani?
We've been having a bad day.
Hey, I might not be a doctor, but I know that there's no better cure for a sour face than a couple of boards and some choice waves.
What you think?
I think that's a great idea.
Yeah!
Can't complain, Mom.
I'm camping out with a convicted criminal, and I had my head chewed on by a monster!
Wait, something is not right. 626 is returning willingly to water.
Hold on, Mom, another call.
Mr.
Pleakley, you are overdue.
I want a status report.
Things are going well.
He cannot swim!
Things are going well.
Jumba, aren't they going well?
Why will he risk drowning?
Jumba?
Jumba, help me out here.
I would have expected you back by now with 626 in hand.
Just a few things left to pack, and we'll be...
Hang up.
We are going swimming.
Yeah!
Lilo!
What happened?
Some                 lolo                 must have stuffed us in the barrel.
Where's Stitch?
Get off of her!
What happened?
Stitch dragged her down.
We lost Stitch!
Lilo?
Lilo, look at me.
Look at me, baby.
Are you hurt?
No.
He's unconscious, but I think he's alive.
David, take Lilo.
This isn't what it looks like.
We were...
It's just that...
I know you're trying, Nani, but you need to think about what's best for Lilo, even if it removes you from the picture.
I'll be back tomorrow morning for Lilo.
I'm sorry.
Nani?
Is there something I can do?
No, David.
I need to take Lilo home now.
We have a lot to talk about, you know.
Thanks.
You know, I really believed they had a chance.
Then you came along.
Lilo, honey, we have to...
Don't worry.
You're nice, and someone will give you a job.
I would.
Come here.
One fond embrace Until we meet again That's us before.
It was rainy, and they went for a drive.
What happened to yours?
I hear you cry at night.
Do you dream about them?
I know that's why you wreck things and push me.
Our family's little now, and we don't have many toys, but if you want, you could be a part of it.
You could be our baby, and we'd raise you to be good. 'Ohana                 means "family." "Family" means nobody gets left behind, but if you want to leave, you can.
I'll remember you, though.
I remember everyone that leaves.
I...
Lost.
I'm lost.
Help!
I don't like the ocean!
Look, a friendly little dolphin.
They helped sailors in the war...
It's a shark!
It's a shark, and it ain't friendly!
It looks like a dolphin.
Tricky fish!
Tricky fish!
Octopus, come and help me?
The octopus is worse than the shark!
I hate this planet!
Little monster!
Agent Pleakley here.
I have lost patience with you both.
Have you captured 626 or not?
Consider yourselves fired and prison-bound.
Your incompetence is nothing short of unspeakable!
But...
We're fired!
Now we do it my way!
Your way?
Wait!
It seems I have overestimated Jumber and Blinkley.
Jumba and Pleakley.
Whatever.
The mission is in jeopardy.
This could be your chance to redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.
How soon will you be prepared to leave?
Immediately.
Don't run.
Don't make me shoot you.
You were expensive.
Yes.
Yes, that's it.
Come quietly.
Waiting.
For what?
Family.
You don't have one.
I made you.
Maybe I could.
You're built to destroy.
You can never belong.
Now come quietly, and we will take you apart.
No, no, no, no, don't, don't run!
Don't run!
Lilo.
I didn't hear you get up.
Baby, what's wrong?
Stitch left.
Really?
It's good he's gone.
He didn't want to be here, anyway.
We don't need him.
Lilo, sometimes you try your hardest, but things don't work out the way you want them to.
Sometimes things have to change, and maybe sometimes they're for the better, even if...
Nani!
David!
I think I found you a job.
You what?
Old man Kuakini's store, but we got to hurry.
Okay.
Lilo?
Baby, this is really important.
I need you to stay here for a few minutes.
I'm going to be right back.
Lock the door and don't answer it for anyone, okay?
Things are finally turning around.
David, I owe you one.
That's okay.
You can just date me, and we'll call it even.
Come back here, you little...
Stitch?
What is it?
Hiding behind your little friend won't work anymore.
Didn't I tell you?
We got fired this morning.
New rules.
What are we going to do?
I love this song!
Pliers.
Screwdriver.
Check.
Come out, my friend, from whomever you're hiding behind.
What the...
Come on!
What's the big deal?
I'll put you back together again.
I'll make you taller and not so fluffy!
I like fluffy!
No.
No.
No!
Leave my mother out of this!
You could do with a makeover.
I tried to give you my good looks, but let's face it, something went wrong.
No!
Quick!
Follow me!
If we make it to...
You're alive!
They're all over the place!
Running away?
Here, let me stop you.
You always get in the way!
Where's the girl?
What have you done to the girl?
Hello?
Cobra Bubbles?
Aliens are attacking my house.
No, no, no!
No aliens!
Blue punch buggy!
No punch back.
They want my dog!
There's no need to alert the authorities.
Everything's under control.
Lilo, who was that?
Good, my dog found the chainsaw.
Lilo!
Don't hang...
You shouldn't play with guns.
Okay.
Thank you.
I just remembered.
It's your birthday!
Happy birthday!
Merry Christmas!
It's not Christmas.
Happy Hanukkah!
We're leaving Stitch?
Trust me.
This is not going to end well.
One potato.
Two potato.
Three potato.
Four.
Five potato.
Six potato.
Seven potato, more.
My...
Mother...
Told...
Me...
You...
Are...
It.
I win!
Thanks.
Mahalo                 plenty.
You won't be disappointed.
I'll show up early to help with the morning...
Don't turn left.
No.
One of them had a giant eye in the middle of his face.
Lilo!
Please don't do this.
You know I have no choice.
No!
You're not taking her!
I'm the only one who understands her!
You take that away, she won't stand a chance!
You're making this harder than it needs to be.
But you don't know what you're doing!
She needs me!
Is this what she needs?
It seems clear to me that you need her a lot more than she needs you.
Lilo!
Lilo!
Lilo!
Lilo!
Lilo!
Lilo!
Lilo!
You ruined everything.
You're one of them?
Get out of here, Stitch.
Surprise!
And here I thought you'd be difficult to catch.
Silly me.
Lilo?
Lilo!
There you go, all buckled up for the trip.
And, look, I even caught you a little snack.
No!
Stop!
Lilo.
Okay, talk.
I know you had something to do with this.
Now where is Lilo?
Talk!
I know you can.
Okay, okay.
Where's Lilo?
Lilo...
Now all your washing is up!
You're under arrest!
Read him his rights.
Listen carefully.
Hello?
Galactic Command?
Experiment 626 is in custody.
We'll wait right here.
Don't interact with her.
Where's Lilo?
Who?
What?
Lilo, my sister.
Sorry, we do not know anyone by this...
Lilo!
She's a little girl, this big!
She has black hair and brown eyes, and she hangs around with that thing!
We know her.
Bring her back.
We can't do that.
That would be a misuse of Galactic resources.
See, problem is we're just here for him.
So she's gone?
Look at the bright side.
You won't have to yell at anyone anymore.
Come. 'Ohana.
Hey!
Get away from her.
No!
What did you say? 'Ohana                 means " family." "Family" means nobody...
Nobody gets left behind.
Or forgotten.
Yeah.
Hey.
What?
After all you put me through, you expect me to help you just like that?
Just like that?
Fine.
Fine?
You're doing what he says?
He's very persuasive.
Persuasive?
What exactly are we doing?
Rescue.
We're going to get Lilo?
Good!
I was hoping to add theft, endangerment and insanity to my list of things I did today.
You, too?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What?
Did you think we walked here?
This is Gantu, requesting hyperspace clearance.
Stand by for clearance.
Clearance is granted on vector C-12.
Connect me to the Grand Councilwoman.
Gantu, what's going on?
I thought you'd like to know that the little abomination is...
Yes, Captain?
I'll call you back.
How did you get out of there?
So what exactly are we doing?
Don't worry, is all part of plan.
We are professionals.
Hey!
Get that out of your mouth!
Hold on!
Okay, is show time!
This is it!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Little savage!
Get off my ship!
Stitch!
Computer, locate Experiment 626. 626 located.
We finish this now.
Stitch is unconscious.
What do we do now?
We stay close.
Hope for a miracle.
That's all we can do.
No!
Don't leave me, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Target 626 is in motion.
Speed is 84.
Impossible!
Stitch!
Abomination.
Stupid head.
You're vile!
You're foul!
You're flawed!
Also cute and fluffy!
You came back.
Nobody gets left behind.
Lilo!
Good dog.
David!
Hey, Lilo.
Can you give us a ride to shore?
Sure, but I have to make two trips.
So you're from outer space?
I heard the surfing's choice.
We have 626.
Take him to my ship.
Leave him alone.
Hold on.
Grand Councilwoman, let me explain.
Silence!
I am retiring you, Captain Gantu.
Actually, credit for the capture goes to...
Goes to me.
You'll be lucky if you end up on a Fluff Trog farm after we sort this thing out.
I think I should...
You!
You're the cause of all this!
If it wasn't for your Experiment 626, none of this...
Stitch.
What?
My name Stitch.
Stitch, then.
If it wasn't for Stitch...
Does Stitch have to go in the ship?
Yes.
Can Stitch say goodbye?
Yes.
Thank you.
Who are you?
This is my family.
I found it all on my own.
It's little and broken, but still good.
Yeah.
Still good.
Does he really have to go?
You know as well as I that our laws are absolute.
I cannot change what the council has decided.
Lilo, didn't you buy that thing at the shelter?
Hey!
Three days ago, I bought Stitch at the shelter.
I paid $2 for him.
See this stamp?
I own him.
If you take him, you're stealing.
Aliens are all about rules.
You look familiar.
CIA.
Roswell. 1973.
Yes.
You had hair then.
Take note of this.
This creature has been sentenced to life in exile, a sentence that shall be henceforth served out here on Earth.
And as caretaker of the alien life form, Stitch, this family is now under the official protection of the United Galactic Federation.
We'll be checking in now and then.
I was afraid you were going to say that.
This won't be easy to explain back at headquarters.
I know what you mean.
Don't let those two get on my ship.
CIA?
Former.
Saved the planet once.
Convinced an alien race that mosquitoes were an endangered species.
Now, about your house...
Wait.
Through the snow and sleet and hail, through the blizzard, through the gales, through the wind and through the rain, over mountain, over plain, through the blinding lightning flash, and the mighty thunder crash, ever faithful, ever true, nothing stops him, he'll get through.
Look out for Mr.
Stork That persevering chap He'll come along and drop a bundle in your lap You may be poor or rich It doesn't matter which Millionaires, they get theirs like the butcher and the baker So look out for Mr.
Stork and let me tell you, friend Don't try to get away He'll find you in the end He'll spot you out in China or he'll fly to County Cork So, you better look out for Mr.

Yeah, well...
Oh, Mrs.

This is still part of the service.

I'm just dying to see.
Look at him.
Look at him.
Oh, you sweet little thing.
He is cute, isn't he?
Oh, he is a darling little angel.
Adorable.
Simply adorable.
Did you ever see anything so cunning?
Isn't he a darling?
Is it possible?
Isn't there some mistake?
Just look at those... ...E-A-R-S.
Those what?
Oh, ears!
These!
Aren't they funny?
Oh, my!
My, what a temper.
What did I do?
Tell me, did I say anything?
A perfectly harmless remark.
I just said they're funny.
They certainly are.
After all, who cares about her precious little Jumbo?
Jumbo?
You mean Dumbo!
Dumbo!
That's good.
Dumbo, that's good!
I think I can, I think I can.
I think I can, I think I can.
I think I can, I think I can.
I think I can.

Step right up and get your tickets... ...the big side show before you go into the big top.
Fifteen big attractions that you can't see anywhere else in the world.
The greatest collection in the entire world.
The greatest congress of freaks ever assembled...
Ain't that the funniest thing you ever saw?
Look at his ears!
Hey, guys, look-it, Skinny's an elephant.
You can't hide him.
His ears are still sticking out.
Come on.
Let's see him.
We want a laugh.
That's what we came for.
Biggest slingshot in the world!
Hey!
Cut that out.
Let's get out of here.
You're hurting me.
Help!
Murder!
What's going on?
Mrs.
Jumbo, down!
Surround her.
Tie her down.
Calm down!
Calm down!
Tie her down!
It was so funny!
My dear, can you bear it?
When she doused the ringmaster, I just thought I'd die.
Well, personally, I think she went a bit too far.
After all, one mustn't forget one is a lady.
You're right, dear.
Well, I suppose that's mother love.
It's no excuse for what she did.
Mother love might cover a multitude of sins.
It's true, my dear...
A guy can't eat in peace.
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossiping.
Girls, girls!
Listen!
Have I got a trunkful of dirt.
Darling, tell us.
Go on!
Well, I heard today that they have put her in solitary confinement.
No!
You don't mean it!
How awful for her.
Well, I must say, I don't blame her for anything.
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little F-R-E-A-K.
Yes, him with those ears that only a mother could love.
What's the matter with his ears?
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.
She's right, girls.
Don't forget that we elephants have always walked with dignity.
His disgrace is our own shame.
That's true.
Indeed, it is.
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat at the same bale of hay with him.
Nor I.
I should say so.
That's just how I feel about it.
Here he comes now.
Pretend you don't see him.
How do you like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.
Poor little guy.
There he goes, without a friend in the world.
Nobody to turn to.
I'll do something about this.
A mouse!
You like to pick on little guys?
Why don't you pick on me?
A proud race.
Overstuffed hay bags.
Still afraid of a mouse!
Boy, wait till I tell the little guy.
Where is he?
Hey, Dumbo.
You can come out now.
Golly, maybe I scared him too.
Look, Dumbo, I'm your friend.
Come on out, won't you?
You're not really afraid of little me, are you?
You are?
I must have overdid it in there.
I don't know my own strength sometimes.
Dumbo, look what I got for you.
You gotta come out first.
Too bad you don't trust me. 'Cause I thought you and me, we might get your mother out of the clink.
But I guess you wouldn't be interested.
So long, Dumbo.
Well, that's more like it.
You know, your ma ain't crazy.
She's just brokenhearted.
It ain't nobody's fault you got them big ears.
Oh, boy.
I stepped in it that time.
Gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.
Sure.
As a matter of fact, I think they're very decorative.
You know, lots of people with big ears are famous.
Oh, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.
Make you a star!
A headliner!
Dumbo the Great!
The great what?
You know, Dumbo, we gotta get an idea.
Not just any idea, something colossal.
Like...
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!
He never had an idea in his life.
Just visualize.
One elephant climbs up on top of another elephant, until, finally, all 17 elephants have constructed an enormous pyramid of pachyderms.
I step out.
I blow the whistle.
The trumpets are trumpeting.
Yeah.
And now... ...comes the climax!
Yeah?
What is the climax?
I don't know.
I knew he never had nothin'.
Well, maybe it comes to me in a vision while I dream.
Good night, Joe.
Good night, boss.
Climax?
Climax!
Dumbo, you're a climax.
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.
I am the voice of your subconscious mind.
Your inspiration.
Now, concentrate.
Remember, your pyramid of elephants are in the ring, waiting for a climax.
Climax.
You are now getting that climax.
Climax.
How's the reception?
Coming through OK?
Good.
Suddenly, from the sidelines comes your climax.
Galloping across the arena, he jumps from a springboard to a platform at the very pinnacle of your pyramid.
He waves a flag for a glorious finish.
And who is your climax?
The elephant with the big ears.
The world's mightiest midget mastodon, Dumbo!
Dumbo.
Dumbo...
Dumbo.
Dumbo!
Dumbo.
Dumbo!
I got it!
I got it!
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now present for your entertainment the most stupendous, magnificent, super-colossal spectacle!
On this tiny, little, insignificant ball, we will construct for you a pyramid, not of wood, not of stone...
To hear him talk, you'd think he was going to do it. ...a living, breathing pyramid The stuffed shirt. of ponderous, pulsating, pulchritudinous pachyderms.
I give you the elephants.
Aren't we a bit clumsy?
Gaining a little weight, aren't you, honey?
You're no cream puff yourself, dearie.
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.
Take your foot out of my eye.
Clumsy ox.
Steady, girls.
Boy, that was a close one.
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.
OK, OK.
Don't wave it no more.
I saw you.
Now look, all you gotta do is run out, jump on the springboard.
All right.
Now show me just how you're gonna do it.
That's it.
Thattaboy.
That's the stuff.
Come on.
Oh, Dumbo!
Oh, those ears.
We got to do something, quick.
Ladies and gentlemen, you have now seen the impossible accomplished in front of your faces.
Seven jungle giants, each one weighing not one ounce less...
That windbag.
Why doesn't he come to the point? ...than 4,500 pounds.
And now I present the world's smallest little elephant, who will spring from this springboard, in one spring, to the top of this pyramid, waving his little flag for a grand climax.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Dumbo.
Go on!
Get going.
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo, that's your cue.
You're on, Dumbo.
Out of my way, assassin.
I never thought I'd live to see the big top fall.
Because of that Dumbo, I never can show my face there again.
Look at my beautiful tail.
I'd just like to spank the daylights out of him.
That won't be necessary, dearie.
They fixed him good.
What do you mean?
What did they do?
Did they beat him?
What is it?
Tell us.
Come, come, I demand to know.
Oh, well, they've gone and made him...
Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
Out with it! ...made him a clown.
A clown!
No!
Yes.
Oh, the shame of it.
Let us take the solemn vow.
From now on, he is no longer an elephant.
Mr.
Fireman, save my poor baby!
Save my child!
Save my baby!
Come on, jump.
We'll save ya!
Hurry up.
We'll save you.
Come on, jump.
Jump!
Boy, did we wow 'em out there.
What a performance.
We're good.
Thirteen curtain calls!
Thirteen!
It sure brought down the house.
Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me.
You said it, we rolled them in the aisles.
Boy, what an act.
What an act is right.
Stupendous, I calls it.
They'll have respect for clowns now.
Yeah, you bet.
Boys, this calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.
Am I thirsty!
I could use one of them.
This one's on Dumbo.
Yeah, Dumbo.
There's plaster in his eyes.
See?
They're drinking a toast to you.
Yeah, you're a big hit.
You're terrific.
You're colossal, stupendous.
Come on, alley-oop.
I gotta wash behind your ears.
You ought to be proud.
You're a success.
Look!
A peanut.
Come on, eat it.
It's got lots of vitamins.
It'll give you a lot of... pep.
I forgot to tell you, we're going to see your mother.
I made an appointment.
Didn't I tell you?
Just like me.
I must have forgot.
Come on, get your hat.
Right over there.
Cozy little place, ain't it?
Mrs.
Jumbo.
I hope she's in.
Someone to see you.
Baby mine, don't you cry Baby mine, dry your eye Rest your head close to my heart Never to part, baby of mine Little one, when you play Don't you mind what they say Let those eyes sparkle and shine Never a tear, baby of mine From your head to your toes Baby mine You're so sweet, goodness knows Baby mine You are so precious to me Cute as can be, baby of mine Baby mine Baby mine There you are.
Pour it in me slipper, Joey.
Boy, I can't get over the way we rolled them in the aisles.
Wait till we hit the big top.
This gives me an idea.
Raise the platform the elephant jumps off of.
Yeah.
If they laugh when he jumps 20 feet, they'll laugh twice as hard if he jumps 40 feet.
Yeah, that's right.
Simple mathematics.
Let's make it 80 feet.
Don't be a piker.
Hundred and eighty.
Make it 300.
A thousand.
Yeah, that's good.
Be careful.
You'll hurt the little guy.
Go on.
Elephants ain't got no feelings.
They're made of rubber.
This idea's sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.
Yeah, let's go!
Hey, let's hit him for a raise.
Yeah, sure!
This is worth real dough.
Oh, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise Yes, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise Oh, we're gonna get more money 'cause we know that we're funny We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise I know how you feel, Dumbo.
But you gotta pull yourself together.
What would your mother think of you if she saw you crying like this?
Remember, you come of a proud race.
You're a... ...a pachyderm.
And pachyderms don't cry.
What's crying get you, anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.
There.
You see?
Well, ain't nothing a little water won't cure.
Upsadaisy.
We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy.
Come on.
Here.
Take a trunkful.
Listen, little fella, we may have had a lot of hard luck up till now, but you and me is gonna do big things together.
Hold your breath.
Why, your mother's gonna be so proud of you.
I'm gonna be proud of you too.
The circus is gonna be proud of you.
What do you think of that?
Swallow it.
They can't keep us down.
I guess you had one little one left over.
We'll bounce back so hard...
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What kind of water is this, anyhow?
Balloonies.
Hiya, George.
That's a pretty "strick shlick." All right.
Let's see you blow a square one, pal.
Say, that's very, very clever.
Now blow a great big one.
It's a pretty...
Hey!
Dumbo!
Do you see what I see?
Look out Look out Pink elephants on parade Here they come, hippity-hoppity They're here and there Pink elephants everywhere Look out Look out They're walking around the bed On their head, clippity-cloppity Arrayed in braid Pink elephants on parade What'll I do?
What'll I do?
What an unusual view I can stand the sight of worms and look at microscopic germs But Technicolor pachyderms is really too much for me I am not the type to faint when things are odd or things are quaint But seein' things you know that ain't can certainly give you an awful fright What a sight Chase them away Chase them away I'm afraid, need your aid Pink elephants on parade Pink elephants Pink elephants Pink elephants Well, looky here.
My, my.
Why, this is most irregular.
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.
They ain't dead, is they?
No, dead people don't snore.
Or do they?
What's all the ruckus?
Come on, step aside, brother.
What's cookin' around here?
What's the good news?
What's frying?
Just look down there, brother.
And prepare yourself for a shock.
Well, hush my beak.
Go ahead, wake them up, brother.
Yeah, find out what they're doing.
Yeah.
Ask them what they want.
OK, boys, leave it to me.
Those pink elephants!
Pink elephants!
What's so funny?
What are you boys doing down here?
What are we doing down here?
Well, hear him talk.
Fly up a tree, where you belong.
Say, look here, brother rat.
Brother rat!
Listen, I ain't your brother, and I ain't no rat!
See?
And I suppose you and no elephant ain't up in no tree either!
No!
Me in no tree and I'm no...
Tree?
Dumbo.
Dumbo.
Wake up, Dumbo!
Don't look now, but I think we're up in a tree.
Don't pay attention to them scarecrows.
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.
So long, boy.
But I wonder how we ever got up in that tree anyway.
Now, let's see.
Elephants can't climb trees, can they?
No, that's ridiculous.
Couldn't jump up.
It's too high.
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...
That's it!
Dumbo, you flew!
Am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?
Your ears.
Just look at them, Dumbo.
They're perfect wings.
The very things that held you down are gonna carry you up and up and up!
I can see it all now.
Dumbo, the ninth wonder of the universe!
The world's only flying elephant.
Did you ever see an elephant fly?
Well, I've seen a horsefly.
And I've seen a dragonfly.
I seen a housefly.
I've seen all that too.
I seen a peanut stand And heard a rubber band I seen a needle that winked its eye But I be done seen about everything When I see a elephant fly What you say, boy?
I said, when I see a elephant fly I seen a front porch swing Heard a diamond ring I seen a polka-dot railroad tie But I be done seen about everything When I see a elephant fly I saw a clothes horse a-rear up and buck And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck I didn't see that, I only heard Just to be sociable, I'll take your word I heard a fireside chat I saw a baseball bat I just laughed till I thought I'd die But I be done seen about everything When I see a elephant fly But I be done seen about everything When I see a elephant fly With the wind When I see a elephant Fly All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough!
Quiet, gentlemen.
The Reverend Rodent is gonna address you.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
A bunch of big guys like you, picking on a poor little orphan like him.
Suppose you was torn away from your mother when you was just a baby.
Nobody to tuck you in at nights.
No warm, soft, caressing trunk to snuzzle into.
How would you like to be left out alone in a cold, cruel, heartless world?
And why?
I ask you, why?
Just because he's got those big ears, they call him a freak.
The laughingstock of the circus.
Then when his mother tried to protect him, they threw her into the clink.
And on top of that, they made him a clown.
Socially, he's washed up.
But what's the use of talking to you cold-hearted birds?
Go ahead, have your fun.
Laugh at him.
Kick him now that he's down.
Go on!
We don't care.
Come on, Dumbo.
Hey, brother, wait a minute.
Don't go away feeling like that.
We done seen the light.
You boys is OK.
Please.
You've done enough.
But we's all fixin' to help you.
Ain't that the truth, boys?
Yeah, that's right.
You want to make the elephant fly, don't you?
Well, you gotta use a lot of "cology." You know, psychology.
Here's what you do.
First you...
Then, right after that, you...
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?
The magic feather!
Yeah.
I got you.
Dumbo, look!
Have I got it!
The magic feather.
Now you can fly!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Heave-ho.
Heave-ho.

Heave-ho.
Heave-ho.

One, two!
Faster!
Get up flying speed!
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.
Take off!
It's no use.
I guess it's just another one of their...
Look!
Hot diggety!
You're flying!
You're flying!
Why, he flies just like an eagle.
Better than an airplane!
Well, now I've seen everything.
Well, I've clean done seen about everything When I see a elephant fly With the wind When I see an elephant Fly Dumbo, I knew you could do it!
Wait till we get to the big town!
Boy, them city folks is sure in for a surprise!
My baby!
Come on, jump.
Jump!
We'll save you.
Come on, jump.
Look at that house.
Dumbo, you're standing on the threshold of success.
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Got the magic feather?
Good.
OK.
Contact!
Take off!
The magic feather!
Dumbo!
Come on, fly!
Open them ears!
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly!
Honest, you can.
Hurry, open them up!
Hurry!
We did it!
Let's show 'em, Dumbo!
Power dive!
Now, loop the loop.
You're making history!
I seen a peanut stand Heard a rubber band I seen a needle that winked its eye But I be done seen about everything When I seen a elephant fly Oh, my When I see When I see When I see an elephant fly Look at him go!
When I see an elephant fly Happy landing, son!
When I see an elephant fly I wish I'd have got his autograph.
Man, I got his autograph.
So long, glamour boy.
Frozen.
Born of cold and Winter air And mountain rain combining, This icy force both foul and fair.
Has a frozen heart worth mining.
Cut through the heart, Cold and Clear.
Strike for love And Strike for fear.
See the beauty Sharp and Sheer.
Split the ice apart.
And break the frozen heart.
Hup!
Ho!
Watch your step!
Let it go!
Hup!
Ho!
Watch your step!
Let it go!
Beautiful!
Powerful!
Dangerous!
Cold!
Ice has a magic Can't be controlled.
Stronger than one, Stronger than ten.
Stronger than a hundred men!
Born of cold and winter air And mountain rain combining.
This icy force both Foul and Fair.
Has a frozen heart worth mining.
Cut through the heart, Cold and Clear.
Strike for love and strike for fear.
There's beauty and there's Danger here.
Split the ice apart!
Beware the frozen heart.
Come on, Sven!
Elsa.
Psst Elsa!
Wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Anna, go back to sleep.
I just can't.
The sky's awake, so I'm awake, so we have to play. ...Go play by yourself.
Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Do the magic!
Do the magic!
Ready?
Uhhm...
This is amazing!
Watch this!
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.
I love you, Olaf.
Al'right.
Catch me! - Gotcha!
Again!
Wait!
Slow down!
Anna!
Anna?
Mama!
Papa!
You Ok, Anna.
I Got you.
Elsa, what have you done?
This is getting out of hand!
It was an accident.
I'm sorry, Anna.
She's ice cold.
I know where we have to go.
Ice?
Faster, Sven!
Sven!
Please...
Help!
My daughter!
He is the King!
Trolls...?
Shush.
I'm trying to listen.
Cuties.
I'm gonna keep you.
Your Majesty!
Born with the powers or cursed?
Born.
And they're getting stronger.
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
The heart is not so easily changed, But the head can be persuaded.
Do what you must.
I recommend we remove all magic, even memories of magic to be safe...
But don't worry, I'll leave the fun.
She will be okay.
But she won't remember I have powers?
It's for the best.
Listen to me, Elsa, your power will only grow.
There is beauty in it...
But also great danger.
You must learn to control it.
Fear will be your enemy.
No.
We'll protect her.
She can learn to control it.
I'm sure.
Until then, we'll lock the gates.
We'll reduce the staff.
We will limit her contact with people and keep her powers hidden from everyone... including Anna.
Elsa?
Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on let's go and play.
I never see you anymore.
Come out the door.
It's like you've gone away.
We used to be best buddies.
And now we're not.
I wish you would tell me why.
Do you want to build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman.
Go away, Anna. ...Okay bye.
The gloves will help.
See...
Conceal it.
Don't feel it.
Don't let it show.
Do you want to build a snowman?
Or ride our bike around the hall?
I think some company is overdue...
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls.
Hang in there, Joan.
It gets a little lonely all these empty rooms.
Just watching the hours tick by.
I'm scared.
It's getting stronger.
Getting upset only makes it worse.
Calm down.
No.
Don't touch me.
Please.
I don't want to hurt you.
See you in two weeks.
Do you have to go?
You'll be fine, Elsa.
Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there.
People are asking where you've been, They say have courage and I'm trying to...
I'm right out here for you.
Just let me in.
We only have each other.
It's just you and me.
What are we gonna do?
Do you want to build a snowman?
Three Years Later.
Welcome to Arendelle!
Thank you, Sir!
Watch your Steps please.
The Gates Will opening Soon.
Why do I have to wear this?
Because the Queen has come of age.
It's Coronation Day!
That's not my fault.
What do you want, Sven?
Give me a snack!
What's the magic word?
Please!
A..a... a... a!
Share!
I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates!
And for a whole day!
Faster, Persi!
Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner.
Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches. ...Did I just say that out loud?
Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to.
See the Queen and the Princess.
I bet they're absolutely lovely.
I bet they are beautiful.
Princess Anna...? ...Huh?
Yeah?
Sorry to wake you, ma'am but...
No, no, no.
You didn't.
I've been up for hours.
Who is it?
It's still me, ma'am.
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.
Of course!
Ready for what?
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.
My sister's cor-neration...
It's coronation day!
It's coronation day!
The window is open!
So's that door!
I didn't know they did that anymore.
Who knew we owned 8000 salad plates...?
For years I have roamed these empty halls.
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally, they're opening up the gates!
There'll be real, actual people It'll be totally strange.
But wow am I so ready for this change!
For the first time in forever, There'll be music, there'll be light.
For the first time in forever, I'll be dancing through the night.
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy, But I'm somewhere in that zone. 'Cause for the first time in forever, I won't be alone.
I can't wait to meet everyone...
What if I meet "the one"?
Tonight, imagine me gown and all.
Fetchingly draped against the wall.
The picture of sophisticated Grace.
I suddenly see him standing there, a beautiful stranger tall and fair.
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!
But then we laugh and talk all evening, Which is totally bizarre.
Nothing like the life I've led so far.
For the first time in forever, There'll be magic, There'll be fun.
For the first time in forever, I could be noticed by someone.
And I know it is totally crazy.
To dream I'd find romance.
But for the first time in forever, At least I've got a chance!
Don't let them in.
Don't let them see.
Be the good girl You always have to be.
Conceal.
Don't feel.
Put on a show.
Make one wrong move and everyone will know.
But it's only for today.
It's only for today!
It's agony to wait.
It's agony to wait.
Tell the guards to open up the...
The gate!
For the first time in forever.
Don't let them in don't let them see I'm getting what I'm dreaming of.
Be the good girl you always have to be.
A chance to change my Only world.
Conceal.
Conceal.
Don't feel.
A chance to find true love Don't See, Don't Feel, Don't Let them know.
I know it all ends tomorrow, So it has to be today! 'Cause for the first time in forever...
For the first time in forever!
Nothing's in my way!
Hey!
I'm so sorry.
Are you hurt?
Hey!
I-ya, no.
No.
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I was going.
But I'm great, actually.
Oh, thank goodness.
Oh...
Umm...
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
Princess Anna of Arendelle.
Princess...?
My Lady.
Hi... again.
Oh boy.
Ha.
This is awkward.
Not you're awkward, but just because we're...I'm awkward.
You're gorgeous.
Wait, what?
I'd like to formally apologize for hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...
And for every moment after.
No.
No-no.
It's fine.
I'm not THAT Princess.
I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be... 'Cuz, you know...
Hello.
But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.
Just you? ...The bells.
The coronation.
I...
I...
I better go.
I have to...I better go.
Bye!
Your Majesty, The gloves. (formal, in Old Norse) Sehm hon hell drr in-um hell-gum Ayg-num Ok krund ee thes-um hellgah Stahth, ehk teh frahm fur-ear Uthear... ...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Princess Anna of Arendelle!
Here?
Are you sure?
I do not think I suppose to...Okay.
Hi.
Hi me...?
Oh.
Um.
Hi.
You look beautiful...Thank you.
You look beautifuller.
I mean, not Fuller.
You don't look Fuller, but more beautiful.
Thank you.
So, this is what a party looks like?
It's warmer than I thought.
And what is that amazing smell? ...
Chocolate.
Your Majesty.
The Duke of Weaseltown.
Weselton.
The Duke of Weselton..
Your Majesty, As your closest partner in trade, It seems only fitting that I offer you.
Your first dance as Queen.
Thank you...
Only I don't dance.
But my sister does.
Lucky you...Oh, I don't think...
If you swoon, let me know, I'll catch you.
Sorry.
Like an agile peacock...
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.
Why did they shut them in the first place?
Do you know the reason?
Hmm?
No.
No...
Oh, all right.
Hang on.
They don't call me "the little dipper" for nothing.
Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey...
I fly.
Let me know when you're ready for another round, M'Lady.
Well, he was sprightly.
Especially for a man in heels.
Are you okay?
I've never been better.
This is so nice.
I wish it could be like this all the time.
Me too...
But it can't.
Why not?
If...It just can't.
Excuse me for a minute.
Glad I caught you.
Hans!
I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide...Oops.
Sorry. ...
Your physique helps I'm sure too.
What's this?
I was born with it, Although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll.
I like it.
Yeah, The whole thing!
You got it.
Okay wait, wait.
So you have how many brothers?
Twelve older brothers.
Three of them pretended I was invisible... literally... for two years.
That's horrible.
It's what brothers do. ...
And sisters.
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.
But then, one day she just shut me out, and...
And I never knew why.
I would never shut you out.
Okay, can I just say something crazy?
I love crazy.
All my life has been a series of doors in my face.
And then suddenly I bump into you.
I was thinking the same thing, because like...
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place.
And maybe it's the party talking, Or the chocolate fondue.
But with you...
I found my place.
I see your face.
And it's nothing like I've ever known before.
Love is an open... door!
Love is an open... door...Door...
Love is an open... door...
With you!
With you!
Love is an open door.
I mean it's crazy.
What?
We finish each other's...Sandwiches!
That's what I was gonna say!
I've never met someone...Who thinks so much like me.
Jinx... jinx again.
Our Mental Synchronization Can have but one explanation, You and I were just meant to be.
Say goodbye.
To the pain of the past.
We don't have to feel it anymore!
Love is an open... door!
Love is an open door!
Life can be so much more...with you!
With you!
Love is an open... door.
Can I say something crazy...?
Will you marry me?
Can I just say something even crazier?
Yes.
Oops!
Pardon.
Sorry.
Can we just get around you there?
Thank you.
Oh, there she is.
Elsa!
I mean...
Queen...
Me again.
May I present, Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
Your Majesty.
We would like...your blessing... of... our marriage!
Marriage...?
Yes!
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Well, We haven't worked out all the details ourselves.
We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony.
Of course we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream and then...
Wait.
Would we live here?
Here?
Absolutely!
Anna...
Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us...
What?
No, no, no, no, no.
Of course we have the room.
I don't know.
Some of them must...
Wait.
Slow down.
No one's brothers are staying here.
No one is getting married.
Wait, what?
May I talk to you, please.
Alone.
No.
Whatever you have to say, you... you can say to both of us.
Fine.
You can't marry a man you just met.
You Can if it's true love.
Anna, what do you know about true love?
More than you.
All you know is how to shut people out.
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.
Now, Excuse me.
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...
No, you may not.
And I-I think you should go.
The party is over.
Close the gates.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What?
Elsa, no.
No, wait!
Give me my glove!
Elsa, please.
Please.
I can't live like this anymore. ...
Then leave. ...
What did I ever do to you?!
Enough, Anna.
No.
Why?
Why do you shut me out?!
Why do you shut the world out?!
What are you so afraid of?!
I said, enough!
Sorcery.
I knew there was something dubious going on here.
Elsa...?
There she is.
Your Majesty!
Long live the Queen!
Queen Elsa...
Come drink with us.
Queen Elsa.
Your Majesty?
Are you all right?
There she is!
Stop her!
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away!
Monster...
Monster!
Elsa!
Elsa...
Wait, Please!
Elsa, Stop!
Anna!
No.
The Fjord.
Snow?
Yes, snow!
Are you all right?
No.
Did you know?
No.
Look!
It's snowing!
It's snowing!
The Queen has cursed this land!
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her...Wait, no!
You!
Is there sorcery in you, too?
Are you a monster, too?
No.
No.
I'm completely ordinary.
That's right she is. ...
In the best way.
And my sister's not a monster.
She nearly killed me.
You slipped on ice...Her ice!
It was an accident.
She was scared.
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this...
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.
So I'm the one that needs to go after her.
What?
Yeah.
Bring me my horse, please.
Anna, no.
It's too dangerous.
Elsa's not dangerous.
I'll bring her back, And I'll make this right.
I'm coming with you...No.
I need you here to take care of Arendelle.
On my honor.
I leave Prince Hans in charge!
Are you sure you can trust her?
I don't want you getting hurt.
She's my sister, She would never hurt me.
The Snow glows white on the mountain tonight, Not a footprint to be seen.
A kingdom of isolation.
And it looks like I'm the Queen.
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried...
Don't let them in, Don't let them see, Be the good girl you always have to be.
Conceal, Don't feel, Don't let them know.
Well, Now they know.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Can't hold it back anymore.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Turn away and Slam the door.
I don't care what they're going to say.
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anyway.
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small.
And the fears that once controlled me.
Can't get to me at all.
It's time to see what I can do, To test the limits and Break through.
No right, No wrong, No rules for me...
I'm free!
Let it go!
Let it go!
I am one with the wind and sky.
Let it go!
Let it go!
You'll never see me cry.
Here I Stand And...
Here I'll stay.
Let the storm rage on...
My power flurries through the air into the ground.
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around.
And one thought crystallizes like An icy blast...
I'm never going back, The Past is in the Past!
Let it go!
Let it go!
And I'll rise like the break of Dawn.
Let it go!
Let it go!
That perfect girl is gone.
Here I stand in the light of day.
Let the storm rage on!
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Elsa!
Elsa!
Elsa, It's me, Anna...
Your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer.
I'm sorry.
It's all my f-f-fault.
Of course, none of this would have happened if she'd just told me her secret... ha...
She's a stinker.
Oh no.
No.
No.
No.
Come back.
No.
Oooo-Kay.
Snow, it had to be snow, She couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm...
Fire!
Whoa!
Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.
Ooh!
And Sauna...
Big summer blow out.
Half off swimming suits, clogs, And a sun balm of my own invention, yah?
Oh, great.
For now, how about boots, Winter boots... and dresses?
That would be in our winter department.
Oh.
Um, I was just wondering; Has another young woman, The Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here?
Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear.
You and this fellow...
Hoo hoo.
Big summer blow out.
Carrots.
Hah?
Behind you.
Oh, right.
Excuse me.
A real howler in July, Yes?
Where ever could it be coming from?
The North Mountain.
North Mountain.
That'll be forty.
Forty?
No, ten.
Oh dear, that's no good.
See.
These are from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem.
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem?
I sell ice for a living.
Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now.
I mean, that is really...
Ahem.
That's unfortunate.
Still forty.
But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna.
Hoo hoo!
Hi, family.
Ten's all I got.
Help me out.
Ten will get you this and no more.
Okay, just tell me one thing...What was ...happening on the North Mountain?
Did it seem magical?
Yes!
Now, back up while I deal with this crook here.
What did you call me?
Okay.
Okay, I'm-Ow!
Whoa!
Bye bye.
No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.
But I did find us a place to sleep.
And it's free.
I'm sorry about this violence.
I will add a quart of lutefisk, So We'll have good feelings.
Just the outfit and boots, yah?
Reindeers are better than people.
Sven, Don't you think that's true?
Yeah, People will beat you & Curse you & Cheat you.
Every one of em's bad, Except you.
Oh, Thanks, Buddy.
But People smell better than Reindeers.
Sven, Don't you think I'm right?
That's once again true, For all Except you.
You got me.
Let's call it a night.
Good night.
Don't let the Frostbite bite.
Nice duet.
Oh, it's just you.
What do you want?
I want you to take me up the North Mountain.
I don't take people places.
Let me rephrase that...
Take me up the North Mountain...
Please.
Look, I know how to stop this winter.
We leave at Dawn...
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.
Oops.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't...
We leave now.
Right now.
Hang on!
We like to go fast!
I like fast!
Whoa, whoa!
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?
Ew.
No, I was raised in a castle.
So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?
Oh well, it was all my fault.
I got engaged but then she freaked out because...
I'd only just met him, you know, that day.
And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage...
Wait.
You got engaged to someone you just met?
Yeah.
Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad.
And then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove...
Hang on.
You mean to tell me.
You got engaged to someone you just met?!
Yes.
Pay attention.
But the thing is... she wore the gloves all the time, So I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
Yes, they did...
But Hans is not a stranger.
Oh yeah?
What's his last name? ...Of-the-Southern-Isles?
What's his favorite food?
Sandwiches.
Best friend's name?
Probably John.
Eye color...Dreamy.
Foot size?
Foot size doesn't matter.
Have you had a meal with him yet?
What if you hate the way he eats?
What if you hate the way he picks his nose?
Picks his nose?
And eats it.
Excuse me, Sir.
He's a Prince.
All men do it.
Ew.
Look it doesn't matter, it's true love.
Doesn't sound like true love.
Are you some sort of love expert?
No.
But I have friends who are.
You have friends who are love experts?
I'm not buying it...Stop talking.
No, no, no.
I'd like to meet these...
No, I mean it.
SHHH.
Sven, go.
Go!
What are they?
Wolves.
Wolves?
What do we do?
I've got this.
You just... don't fall off and don't get eaten.
But I wanna help...No.
Why not?
Because I don't trust your judgment.
Excuse me?!
Who marries a man she just met?
It's true love!
Christopher!
It's Kristoff!
Duck!
You almost set me on fire!
But I didn't.
Get ready to jump, Sven!
You don't tell him what to do!
I do!
Jump, Sven!
But I just paid it off.
Uh-oh.
No, no, no.
Grab on!
Pull, Sven!
Pull!
I'll replace your sled and everything in it.
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.
Of course I don't want to help her anymore.
In fact, this whole thing has ruined me.
For helping anyone ever again.
But she'll die on her own.
I can live with that.
But you won't get your new sled if she's dead.
You know sometimes I really don't like you.
Hold up.
We're coming.
You are?!
I mean, sure.
I'll let you tag along.
Arendelle...It's completely frozen.
But it'll be fine.
Elsa will thaw it.
Will she?
Yeah.
Now come on.
This way to the North Mountain?
More like this way.
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
YEAH...
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
But it's so white.
You know, how about a little color?
I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse...
How 'bout yellow...no, not yellow.
Yellow and snow?
Brrrr... no go.
Am I right?
Hi!
You're creepy.
I don't want it!
Backatchya!
Please don't drop me.
Come on, it's just a head.
Don't!
All right, we got off to a bad start.
Ew, ew, the body!
Wait, what am I looking at right now?
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat? ...Al'right.
Wait one second.
Oooh!
Thank you!
You're welcome.
Now I'm perfect.
Well, almost.
It was like my whole life got upside down.
Oh!
Too hard.
I'm sorry!
I was just...
Woo!
Head Rush!
Are you okay?
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!
I've always wanted a nose.
So cute.
It's like a little baby unicorn.
What?
Hey!
Whoa.
Oh, I love it even more!
Hah...
All right, let's start this thing over.
Hi everyone.
I'm Olaf.
And I like warm hugs.
Olaf?
That's right, Olaf.
And you are?
Oh, um...
I'm Anna.
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
That's Sven.
Uh-huh.
And who's the reindeer?
Sven.
They're...oh, okay...Makes things easier for me.
Ha.
Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose.
I like you, too!
Olaf, Did Elsa build you?
Yeah.
Why?
You know where she is?
Yeah.
Why?
Do you think you could show us the way?
Yeah.
Why?
How does this work?
Stop it, Sven.
Trying to focus here.
Yeah, Why?
I'll tell you Why.
We need Elsa to Bring back Summer.
Summer?
Uhum.
Oh, I don't know why but.
I've always loved the idea of summer, And Sun, and all things hot.
Really?
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
Nope!
But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.
Bees'll Buzz, Kids'll blow dandelion fuzz.
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer.
A drink in my hand, My snow up against the burning sand.
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in Summer.
I'll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm.
And find out what happens to solid water, When it gets warm.
And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me.
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer!
The hot and the cold are both so intense, Put 'em together, It just makes sense!
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle, But put me in summer and I'll be a...
Happy Snowman!
When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream of relaxing in the summer sun just letting off steam!
Oh the sky will be Blue...
And you guys'll be there too.
When I finally do what frozen things do in Summer!
I'm gonna tell him.
Don't you dare.
In Summer!
So, Come on!
Elsa's this way.
Let's go bring back summer!
I'm coming!
Somebody's got to tell him.
No.
No.
You've got the bark facing down.
The bark needs to be face-up.
Bark down is drier.
Bark up...Bark down.
Cloak.
Does anyone need a cloak?
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.
The castle is open.
There's soup and hot glogg in the Great Hall.
Here.
Pass these out.
Prince Hans, are we just expected to sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle's Tradable goods?
Princess Anna has given her orders and...
And that's another thing, has it dawned on you that your Princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress... to destroy us all?
Do not question the Princess.
She left me in charge, and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason.
Treason?!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa, boy.
Easy.
Easy.
Princess Anna's horse.
What happened to her?
Where is she?
Princess Anna is in trouble.
I need volunteers to go with me to find her!
I volunteer two men, my Lord!
Be prepared for anything, And should you encounter the Queen, You are to put an end to this winter.
Do you understand?
So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?
Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.
That's your plan?
My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister.
Yup.
So you're not at all afraid of her?
Why would I be?
Yeah.
I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest, Warmest person ever.
Oh, look at that.
I've been impaled.
What now?
It's too steep.
I've only got one rope, And you don't know how to climb mountains.
Says who?
What are you doing?
I'm going to see my sister.
You're going to kill yourself.
I wouldn't put my foot there.
You're distracting me...Or there.
How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?
I'm just blocking you out 'cause I gotta concentrate here.
You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone.
Nobody wants to be alone.
Except maybe you...
I'm not alone...I have friends, remember?
You mean the love experts?
Yes, the love experts!
Please tell me I'm almost there.
Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?
Hang on...Hey, Sven?
Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.
Ha ha.
Thank goodness.
Catch!
Thanks!
That was like a crazy trust exercise.
Now that's ice.
I might cry.
Go ahead.
I won't judge.
All right, take it easy.
Come here, I gotcha.
Okay.
You stay right here, buddy.
Flawless.
Knock...
Just knock...
Why isn't she knocking...?
Do you think she knows how to knock?
It opened.
That's a first.
You should probably wait out here.
What?
Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.
But.
But...Oh come on, It's a palace made of ice.
Ice is my life...Bye, Sven.
You too, Olaf.
Me?
Just give us a minute.
Okay.
One... two...
Three... four...
Elsa?
It's me...
Anna.
Anna?
Wow...
Elsa, you look different...
It's a good different...And this place.
Is amazing...Thank you.
I never knew what I was capable of.
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd known...
No, it's okay.
You don't have to apologize.
But you should probably go, please.
But I just got here.
You belong in Arendelle.
So do you...No, Anna.
I belong here.
Alone.
Where I can be who I am, Without hurting anybody.
Actually, about that...58... 59... 60.
Wait.
What is that?
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.
Olaf?
You Built me.
You remember that?
And You're alive?
Um...
I think so?
He's just like the one we built as kids.
Yeah!
So we were so close.
We can be like that again.
Slow Down...
Anna!
No, We can't.
Goodbye, Anna...Elsa, wait...
No, I'm just trying to protect you.
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.
Please don't shut me out again.
Please don't slam the door.
You don't have to keep your distance anymore. 'Cause for the first time in forever, I finally understand.
For the first time in forever, We can fix this hand in hand.
We can head down this mountain Together.
You don't have to live in fear. 'Cause for the first time in forever, I will be right here.
Anna, Please go back home.
Your life awaits.
Go enjoy the sun And open up the gates.
Yeah, But...I know!
You mean well, But leave me be.
Yes, I'm alone.
But I'm alone and Free.
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me.
Actually, We're not.
What do you mean You're not?
I get the feeling you don't know?
What do I not know?
Arendelle's in deep deep deep deep snow.
What?
You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.
Everywhere?
It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.
No, I can't.
I don't know how...Sure you can.
I know you can! 'Cause for the first time in forever, I'm such a Fool!
I can't be Free!
You don't have to be afraid.
No escape From the storm inside of me!
We can work this out together.
I can't control the curse!
We'll reverse the storm you've made.
Anna, Please, You'll only make it worse!
Don't panic.
There's so much fear!
We'll make the sun shine bright.
You're not safe here!
We can face this thing together...
I can't!
Anna.
Are you okay?
I'm okay...
I'm fine...Who's this?
Wait, it doesn't matter.
Just...You have to go.
No, I know we can figure this out together...
How?
What power do you have to stop this winter?
To stop me?
Anna, I think we should go.
No.
I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.
Yes, you are.
Stop.
Put us down!
Go away!
Heads up!
Watch out for my butt!
It is not nice to throw people!
Wow, Wow, Wow Feisty pants.
Ok, Relax.
Just Calm down.
Calm down.
All Right.
I'm Okay.
Just let the snow man be.
I'm Calm...Great.
Oh...
Come on!
Uh-oh.
See.
Now you made him mad!
I'll distract him.
You guys go.
No, no, not you guys.
This just got a whole lot harder.
What are you doing?
I got him!
It's a hundred foot drop.
It's two hundred.
What's that for?
I'm digging a snow anchor.
Okay.
What if we fall?
There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there.
It'll be like landing on a pillow...
Hopefully.
Okay, Anna.
On three.
One...Okay.
You tell me when...
Two...I'm ready to go...I was born ready!
Yes!
Calm down.
Tree!
What the...
Whoa!
That happened.
Ah.
Ah.
Man, am I out of shape.
There we go.
Hey, Anna!
Sven!
Where'd ya guys go?
We totally lost Marshmallow back there!
Hey.
We were just talking about you.
Ll good things, all good things.
No!
This is not making much of a difference!
Is it?
Olaf!
Hang in there, guys!
Go Faster!
Wait, what?
Kristoff!
Don't come back!
We won't.
Hey, you were right.
Just like a pillow.
Olaf!
I can't feel my legs!
Those are my legs.
Ooh.
Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.
Oh, That feels better.
Hey, Sven!
He found us.
Who's my cute little reindeer?
Don't talk to him like that.
Here.
You okay?
Thank you.
Um...
How's your head?
I mean, It's fine.
Ah...
I'm good.
Ha.
I've got a thick skull.
I don't have a skull...Or bones.
So...
So Now what?
Now what?
Now what?!
Oooh!
What am I gonna do?
She threw me out.
I can't go back to.
Arendelle with the weather like this.
And then there's your ice business...
Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business...
Worry about your hair?
What?
Just fell off a Cliff.
You should see your hair.
No, yours is turning white.
White?
It's... what?
It's because she struck you, isn't it?
Does it look bad?
No.
You hesitated.
No, I didn't.
Anna, you need help.
Okay?
Come on.
Okay!
Where are we going?
To see my friends.
The love experts?
Love experts?!
And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this.
How do you know?
Because I've seen them do it before.
I like to consider myself a love expert.
Get it together.
Control it.
Don't feel.
Don't feel.
Don't feel!
Look, Sven.
The sky's awake.
Are you cold?
A little.
Wait.
Come here.
So, About my friends...
Well, I say friends, they're more like family...
Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven until you know, they took us in.
They did?
Yeah.
I don't want to scare you, they can be a little bit inappropriate...
And loud... very loud...
They're also stubborn at times, And a little.
Overbearing.
And heavy.
Really, really heavy.
Which you...
But You know, you okay.
They're fine.
They mean well.
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.
Okay then...
Meet my family.
Hey, guys!
They're rocks.
He's crazy.
Hey, Wow...I pretty Recognize you, What's so much Weigh?
I'll distract them while you run.
Hi, Sven's family!
It's nice to meet you!
Anna, because I love you, I insist you run.
Understand you're love experts!
Why aren't you running?
Okay.
Um...
I'm gonna go...
No, no, no.
Anna, wait!
Kristoff!
Kristoff's home!
Kristoff!
Kristoff's home!
It's been too long!
Kristoff's home!
Wait?
Kristoff?
Yeah...Oh, let me look at you!
Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff, I wash them.
Ah!
No.
I'm gonna keep my clothes on, Look.
Great to see you all.
But where's grand Pabbie?
He's napping.
But look, I grew a mushroom.
And I earned my fire Crystal.
I passed a kidney Stone.
Kristoff, Pick me up.
You're getting big...Good for you.
Trolls?
They're trolls.
He's brought a girl!
What's going on?
I've learned to just roll with it.
Let me see.
Bright eyes.
Working nose.
Strong teeth.
Yes, yes, yes.
She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.
Wait.
Oh.
Um.
No.
You've got the wrong idea.
That's not why I brought her here.
Right.
We're not.
I'm not...
What's the issue, dear?
Why are you holding back from such a man?
Is it the clumpy way he walks?
What?
Or the Grumpy way he talks?
No.
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped ...weirdness of his feet?
Hey!
And though we know he washes well he always ends up Sorta smelly.
But You'll never meet a fella who's as sensitive and sweet.
That's nice.
So he's a bit of a fixer upper, So he's got a few flaws, His peculiar brain, Dear.
His thing for the reindeer.
That outside a few of nature's laws.
This is not about me!
So he's a bit of a fixer upper, But this we're certain of...
You Can fix this fixer upper up with a little bit of love.
Can we just stop talking about this?!
We've got a real, actual problem here.
I'll Say...So tell me dear, Is it the way that he runs scared?
Or that he's Socially Impaired?
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the Woods?
I do not need to know that.
Are you holding back your fondness.
Due to his unmanly blondeness?
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods?
He's just a bit of a fixer upper.
He's got a couple a' bugs.
No, I don't.
His isolation is confirmation of his desperation for healing hugs.
So he's a bit of a fixer upper, But we know what to do.
The way to fix up this fixer ...upper is to fix him up with you.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Enough!
She's engaged to someone else.
Okay?!
So she's a bit of a fixer upper, That's a minor thing.
This quote “engagement” Is a flex arrangement.
And by the way, I don't see no Ring.
So she's a bit of a fixer upper, Her brain's a bit betwixt.
Get the fiance out of the way And the whole thing will be fixed!
We aren't saying you can change him. 'Cause people don't really change.
We're only saying that love's a force.
That's powerful and strange.
People make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed.
But throw a little love their way... throw a little love their way.
And you'll bring out their best!
True love brings out the best!
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper, That's what it's all about.
Father, Sister, Brother We need each other to raise us up and round us out.
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper, But when push comes to shove.
The only fixer upper fixer that can fix a fixer upper is.
True, True, True, True, Love.
Love, Love, Love, True Love...True-e-e-e-e-e.
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded...
Wait, what?!
You're getting married.
She's as cold as ice.
There's strange magic here!
Grand Pabbie!
Bring her to me.
Anna, your life is in danger.
There is ice in your heart, put there by your sister.
If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.
What ...?
No.
But you can remove it, Right?
I can not, I'm sorry Kristoff...
If it was her head that would be easy.
But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.
An act of true love?
A true love's kiss, perhaps?
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.
Hans.
Pull us out, Sven.
Olaf!
Come on.
I'm coming!
Let's go kiss Hans!
Who is this Hans?!
We are here to find Princess Anna.
Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the Queen.
Do you understand?
Yes, Sir.
The Queen.
Up there!
Come on!
No, Please.
Stay away!
Fire!
Fire.
Get her!
Get her!
Queen Elsa!
Don't be the monster they fear you are.
No...
What have I done?
Why did you bring me here?
I couldn't just let them kill you.
But I'm a danger to Arendelle.
Get Anna.
Anna has not returned...
If you would just stop the winter, bring back summer... please.
Don't you see...
I can't.
You have to tell them to let me go.
I will do what I can.
Just hang in there.
Come on, buddy, faster!
I'll meet you guys at the castle!
Stay out of sight, Olaf!
I will!
It's Princess Anna!
Are you g-gonna be okay?
Don't worry about me.
Anna!
Oh, you had us worried sick...My Lady.
Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately.
We will.
Thank you.
Make sure she's safe!
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.
You cannot risk going out there again.
If anything happens to her...
If anything happens to the Princess, you are all Arendelle has left.
He's in here.
Prince Hans.
Anna.
You're so cold.
Hans, you have to kiss me...What?
Now.
Now.
We'll give you two some privacy.
What happened out there?
Elsa struck me with her powers.
You said she'd never hurt you.
I was wrong.
Anna?
She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.
A true love's kiss.
Oh, Anna...
If only there was someone out there who loved you.
What?
You said you did.
As thirteenth in line in my own ...kingdom, I didn't stand a chance.
I knew...
I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere...
What are you talking about?
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.
But no one was getting anywhere with her.
But you...Hans?
You were so desperate for love, You were willing to marry me, just like that.
I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.
Hans.
No, stop.
But then she doomed herself, and you were ...dumb enough to go after her.
Please.
All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.
You're no match for Elsa.
No, you're no match for Elsa.
I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.
You won't get away with this.
Oh, I already have.
Please, somebody help.
Please, please!
It's getting colder by the minute.
If we don't do something soon, We'll all freeze to death.
Prince Hans...Princess Anna is...
Dead.
What...?
What happened to her?
She was killed by Queen Elsa.
Her own sister.
At least we got to say our marriage vows... before she died in my arms.
There can be no doubt now, Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger.
Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you.
With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death.
Hurry Up!
She's dangerous.
Move quickly and be careful.
The Door not open!
What is it, buddy?
Hey, watch it.
What's wrong with you?
I don't understand you when you talk like that.
Ah!
Stop it!
Put me down!
No, Sven!
We're not going back!
She's with her true love.
What the...
Anna!
Help.
Anna.
Oh no.
Olaf?
Olaf.
Get away from there.
So this is heat...
I love it.
Ooh!
But don't touch it!
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.
Huh.
But we ran all the way here?
Please Olaf, you can't stay here, you'll melt.
I am not leaving here until we find ...some other act of true love to save you.
Do you happen to have any ideas?
I don't even know what love is.
That's okay, I do...Love is... putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever.
Kristoff loves me?
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?
Olaf, you're melting.
Some people are worth melting for.
Just maybe not right this second.
Don't worry, I've got it!
We're going to get through...
Oh, wait.
Hang on.
I'm getting something.
It's Kristoff and Sven!
They're coming back this way.
They-they are?
Wow, he's really moving fast.
Huh...I guess I was wrong.
I guess Kristoff doesn't love ...you enough to leave you behind.
Help me up, Olaf.
Please.
No, no, no, no, no.
You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.
I need to get to Kristoff.
Why?
Oh, oh, oh, I know why.
There's your act of true love right there, Riding across the fjords like a Valiant, pungent reindeer King!
Come on!
Look out!
Back this way!
We're trapped.
Slide, Anna.
We made it!
Go, Go, Go, Go...
Come on, buddy, faster.
Kristoff!
Kristoff!
Sven!
Good boy.
Kristoff.
Anna!
Elsa.
You can't run from this!
Just take care of my sister...Your sister?
She returned from the mountain weak and cold.
She said you froze her heart.
I tried to save her, but it was too late.
Her skin was ice.
Her hair turned white...
Your sister is dead... because of you.
No!
Kristoff?
Anna!
Elsa?
No!
Anna!
Oh, Anna... no... no, please no.
Anna.
Anna?
Anna?
Oh, Elsa.
You sacrificed yourself for me?
I love you.
An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.
Love... will thaw...
Love...
Of course.
Elsa?
Love.
I knew you could do it.
Hands down, this is the best day of my life... and quite possibly the last.
Oh, Olaf.
Hang on, little guy.
Hey, my own personal flurry.
Anna?
But she froze your heart.
The only frozen heart around here is yours.
I will return this scoundrel to his country.
We shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior.
Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.
This is unacceptable.
I am innocent.
I'm a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.
Ow!
My neck hurts.
Is there a doctor I could...
No?
I demand to see the Queen!
I have a message from the Queen.
Arendelle will henceforth and forever ...no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown.
Weselton.
It's Weselton!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Ow, Okay, Okay...
Pole...Oops.
So Sorry.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we are.
I owe you a sled.
Are you serious?
Yes.
And it's the latest model.
No.
I can't accept this...
You have to.
No returns.
No exchanges.
Queen's orders.
She's named you the official.
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.
What?
That's not a thing...Sure it is.
And it even has a cup holder...Do you like it?
Like it?
I love it...
I could kiss you!
I could.
I mean I'd like to.
I'd... may I?
We me...
I mean, may we?
Wait, what?
We may.
Summer!
Hello.
Are you ready?
I like the open gates.
We are never closing them again.
What?
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't ska...
Come on, you can do it!
Hey, girls!
Hey, Guys
Now, where to begin?
How 'bout, "Once upon a time“?
How many times have you heard that to begin a story?
Let's do somethin' else.
I got it, I got it, here we go.
Here's how to open a movie!
No, I don't think so.
It sounds familiar.
Doesn't it, to you?
Oh, no, no, not the book.
How many have seen "opening the book" before?
Close the book.
We 're not doing that.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Why don't I just go back to the day things took a turn for the worse?
Run for your lives!
Everyone run for cover!
SOS!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Code red!
Duck and cover!
You're all in danger!
Ah!
Run for cover!
Run for your lives!
Emergency!
Emergency!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Aaah!
Look out!
Take cover!
Run for cover!
Chicken Little!
What is it?
What's going on?
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling?
Are you crazy?
No, no, no!
It's true!
Come with me!
No.
Son?
What?
It happened under the old oak tree!
I'm not making this up.
It's here.
There's a piece of the sky somewhere... ...somewhere on the ground.
It was shaped like that!
It looks like a stop sign?
Yes!
Only it doesn't say "stop" and it's blue and it has a cloud on it.
And it hit me on the head!
It looked like a stop sign.
Wait!
What's that?
Son, is this what hit you?
What?
Oh, no, Dad.
It was definitely a piece of the sky!
Piece of the sky.
It's OK, everyone!
Dad, no.
There's been, like, a little mistake.
It was just an acorn that-that hit my son.
A little acorn.
No!
Dad, no.
Quiet, son.
This is embarrassing enough already.
Chicken Little!
What were you thinkin'?
Why put your town's safety in jeopardy?
How could you mistake a stop sign for an acorn?
But it... a big acorn level fluh.
What did he say?
A big acorn level fluh...
It was a big acorn?
An ape throwing coleslaw?
A big acorn level fluh...
Gesundheit!
Ladies and gentlemen, it's just gibberish, gibberish of an insane person.
Come on, Buck!
Your kid went and scared us all half to death!
Well, what can I tell you, folks, my son, you know...
Kids do crazy stuff.
You have kids.
It's...
No, Dad.
It wasn't an acorn.
It was... it was a piece of the sky.
Really, it was.
You gotta believe me.
A movie.
A movie.
They're makin' a movie.
When?
When will everybody forget your big mistake?
First it was all over the papers, then they wrote a book about it, then the book on tape, then the board game, the spoons with your face on it... ...and the Web site, the commemorative plates.
You saw them, right?
Yeah.
I saw them.
Can't eat off 'em.
They're not microwave-safe.
You saw the billboards?
I saw them.
Ha!
There's a bumper sticker.
I knew it was only a matter of time.
Billboards I could live with.
Posters I could even live with.
But a bumper sticker.
It's... it's like glued on forever.
It doesn't matter.
You know why?
Because I've got a plan.
Yeah, about that.
Well, remember how I told you it would be better for you to lay low, don't call attention to yourself?
Yes, but I...
See, it's like a game.
Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek, except the goal is never to be found, ever!
Great!
Now, we've got a plan, right?
I'll see ya later!
Remember, lay low.
Yeah.
OK.
Bye.
Look, Mama!
There's the crazy chicken!
Yes, it is!
Crazy chicken.
You're so smart.
We don't make eye contact.
Bye!
That's it.

Oh, man.
Pump it up!
Pump it, pump it, pump it!
Split into two teams.
Popular versus unpopular.
Coach?
Yeah, unpopular?
Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?
Sure!
Hit the pig, kids!
Aaah!
Look out!
Calm down, Runt.
Just...
Just do what Fish is doing. ♪ Everybody dance now 5' Whew!
Tough morning?
A run-in with my old nemesis.
Gum in the crosswalk?
He won this round.
Your old foe!
Mm-hmm.
Incoming on your right.
Thank you!
Aah!
Yeah, I heard about the movie.
Tough break.
Yeah.
Maybe it'll just go straight to video.
That's the least of my problems.
This morning... this morning my dad told me I should basically disappear.
But that's not gonna get me down.
I've got a plan.
You want to hear about it?
Uh-oh.
No, no, no!
This one's good.
Look, one moment destroyed my life, right?
One moment.
Warthog at 3:00!
I see him!
Yes!
So I figure all I need is a chance...
All I need is a chance to do something great to make everyone forget the "sky falling" thing once and for all.
And then my dad'll finally have a reason to be proud of me.
Time out!
Nurse!
Hi, Tiffany!
Hey, man, what's goin' on?
So, what do you think?
OK, listen.
You said the sky was falling.
Your dad didn't support you.
I...
And you have been hurting inside ever since, right?
It's hurt.
It stung.
OK?
It's hurt, but...
Yes.
That's the nutshell.
OK.
Yes, but...
No.
Buh-buh...
But, it's...
What's got to happen now is the nut needs to be cracked open.
And not one little chip at a time, but... bam!
Smash!
Bits of emotion flying everywhere!
Anger!
Frustration!
Denial!
Fear!
Deep depression, in fact!
You see what I'm saying?
Uh...
All right, forget the nut part.
Here's the main thing.
You have got to stop messing around, and deal with the problem.
OK, yes, but...
Here's the real solution.
You and your dad talk-talk-talking... closure!
Closure?
Closure, talking about something until it's resolved.
Wait!
Hold on!
See?
Look.
There's a whole section about it in this month's Modern Mallard.
Incredibly appropriate!
I told you, I have a plan.
Yeah, but according to Cosmo Duck, you should "stop the squawk and try the talk." Beautiful Duckling says, "Avoiding closure with your parents can cause early molting." See?
Closure.
Repeat after me.
You, your dad, talk-talk...
Abby, listen!
Talking's a waste of time.
I got to do something great so my dad doesn't think I'm such a loser.
Come on.
You are not a loser.
You're inventive and resourceful and funny and cute and...
What?
Yeah... uh, Runt!
Should Chicken Little have a good talk with his dad and clear the air or keep searching for Band-Aid solutions and never deal with the problem?
Band-Aid solutions!
Runt!
Well, I'm sorry!
I'm very bad at reading facial cues.
Fish, help me out here.
Men. 'Twas beauty that killed the beast.
I guess only girls are good at honest communication and sensitivity.
That does it!
We were in a time-out, Foxy!
Prepare to hurt.
And I don't mean emotionally, like I do.
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!
Whoa!
We will save you!
Fall back!
Mad goose!
Chicken Little!
Not showing up for class, inappropriate school attire, picking fights in gym class and the fire alarm?
Ever since that "sky falling" incident, he's been nothing but trouble!
Now look, Buck.
You know I have the utmost respect for you.
I mean, you were Buck "Ace" Cluck, our school baseball star.
But let's face the facts.
Your kid, he's nothing like you at all.
OK.
Thank you for talking to me.
I'll take care of my son.
I...
Dad, it wasn't my fault.
It was Foxy.
She's always...
All right.
It's fine.
You don't have to explain anything.
Uh...
Uh...
Hey, Dad?
I was thinkin'.
Yeah, what if I...?
What if...?
What if I joined the baseball team?
Hey, why don't you watch where you're going?!
Sorry, there, buddy!
Sorry, sorry.
Baseball?
Son, we talked about this.
Yeah, right.
But, you know, that was when I was small.
I put on five ounces this year.
I've really bulked up.
Really, son?
Baseball.
Are you sure?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I mean, you know, hey, why not, right?
Yeah, why not, but why?
Well, Dad, you were such a big baseball star in high school.
You could give me some pointers.
But, son, you know, I'm just wondering...
Maybe baseball isn't exactly your thing, you know?
Have you considered the chess team or the glee club?
And some teenagers, you know, they get quite a rush from stamp collecting.
No.
Wanna stop?
We'll get some stamps.
I don't like stamps.
Colors, colorful things...
No, I was thinkin' baseball!
I can't wait to see the look on your face when I smack that ball in for a touchdown!
Dad...
Um, I'm kidding.
That was a... that was a joke.
Just do me one favor, son.
Why, sure, Dad.
Anything.
Just please try not to get your hopes too high.
Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...
I mean, I think I can...

Go, Acorns!
There's excitement in the air, ladies and gentlemen.
It's been two decades since Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals the Spud Valley Taters.
Down by only a single run, and with a player in scoring position, we finally have a chance again.
This excitement isn't about the fun of baseball, it's not about the prize.
It's about gloating and rubbing their noses in it, the "Nah-nah-na-na-na!
We beat you!" taunting, if you will, that comes with the winning.
Yeah!
That's right.
Oakey Oaks and the Honorable Mayor Turkey Lurkey will finally have bragging rights again for one full year!
But this battle has taken a heavy toll on our hometown heroes.
After nine grueling innings and several players out with injuries, the Acorns are scraping the bottom of the roster.
Hopefully, there's just enough muscle on the bench to pull out a win.
Up next...
Chicken Little.
Clearly a long shot, folks.
Little hasn't been up to bat once since joining the team.
He's gonna lose the game for us!
Wait!
If he can get a walk and advance to first, that powerhouse Foxy Loxy can step up and save us all.
She's had a terrific game so far.
A shoo-in for the MVP trophy.
OK, kid, listen up.
You have an itty-bitty, teeny-tiny strike zone.
There's no way he can throw you out!
Take the walk.
Don't swing.
I have a good feeling...
Look at me.
Don't swing.
Take the walk.
You hear me?
Just take the walk!
But, coach, wait!
Don't swing!
Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold the pine, Little advances to the box.
He's going to bat from the right.
Make it the left.
No, the right.
The right.
Easy out!
Left field's found something better to do, center field's got a hunger pang in his second stomach and right field's digging for grubs.
Play ball!
Why him?
Why now?
I won't embarrass you, Dad.
Not this time.
Here's the wind-up, the pitch!
It's a high cutter.
Ball!
Uh...
Strike one!
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.
The catcher lays down the signals.
Here's the pitch.
Curve ball low and outside, he swings!
Stee-rike two!
Ohh!
I said, don't swing!
Don't swing!
No!
Batter up!
That's two in the hole!
One more strike, it's a punch out, folks, and we're all going home.
Today is a new day.
Don't swing!
Well, take away my squeaky toy!
It's a hit!
A hit?
A hit?
A hit?
The batter is unbelievably at home plate.
He's standing in a daze.
Run, kid, run!
Go, son!
Run!
Run!
Run!
There he goes, the wrong way.
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no!
Not that way!
Run the other way!
Turn around!
He's turned!
I've never said these words before, but he's actually rounding home plate!
Goosey steps on home...
A new day!
A tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.
Looks like Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the center fielder!
Mayhem in the outfield, as Rodriguez is fired to second.
Catch is complete, but where's the ball?
Little touches the bag and keeps going.
A hunt for the rock.
The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!
It's stuck!
It's stuck!
Tip the cow!
It's the old tip-the-cow play.
He heads for the hot corner, a stand-up triple!
Yes!
Hold up!
No!
He's going for the whole enchilada!
The ball of wax, kit and caboodle!
Go back!
You're never gonna make it!
Tries to lighten his load!
The outfield behind, Little's on all cylinders!
He slides for the dish!
It's going to be a photo finish at home!
You're out!
Oh, folks.
Folks, what a heartbreaker.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait a cotton-picking second.
Hold your horses, here, and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over.
He...
He's...
Safe!
The runner is safe!
It's all over, folks!
The Acorns have done the impossible!
For the first time in 20 years, we won the pennant!
Mothers, kiss your babies!
You've witnessed a miracle!
Remember where you were at this moment.
The smells!
The sounds!
There's a new winner in town and his name is Chicken Little!
That was just a lucky hit!
Yes, Chicken Little, it's all yours!
The victory, the triumph, the glory!
And getting doused with a sticky drink that soaks into your undies and chafes for hours!
This is one memory you'll savor forever!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yes, yes, yes!
We won!
We won!
That's my boy out there!
That's my boy! ♪ I am the champion My friend ♪ And I'll keep on fightin' till the end ♪ I am the champion ♪ I am the champion ♪ But gone is the loser ♪ 'Cause I am the champion ♪ Of the world A“ Yow!
Here's the wind-up and the pitch!
A knuckleball!
He swings!
Crack!
It's going.
He rounds first, to second!
Hits high off the wall!
He flies past third and heads for the plate!
It's a scramble for the ball!
It's gonna be close!
He is safe!
The mighty Acorns win!
Yes!
Acorns win!
The mighty Acorns win!
Yeah!
Jeez, you know, I guess that puts the whole "sky is falling" incident behind us once and for all.
Hey, kiddo?
You bet, Dad.
I...
Unless you think we need... closure?
Closure?
What's to close here?
Unless you think we need to close...
Not me.
It's closed!
I agree.
Vacuum sealed.
Shut tight!
OK, great, Dad.
You...
Closure, I dunno.
All right.
Enough fun.
Good talk.
Good talk, son.
Here, I'll give you a push.
Rock me a little.
Help me.
OK.
OK, I'm up.
Hey.
Good night, Ace.
Here's the wind-up... and the pitch!
Whoo-hoo!
Thanks.
Thanks for the chance.
Oh...
No!
A piece of the sky?!
Shaped like a stop sign?!
Not again!
Hey!
Son!
You all right?
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
I'm comin' upstairs!
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You sure?
I thought I heard you yell.
No.
Uh, I, uh...
I fell out of bed.
Huh?
How'd you get over there?
Over where?
There.
There!
Where?
How'd you get over there?
Who're we talking about?
Never mind.
What's the difference?
Look, the past is behind us, right?
Mmm.

Watch this.
Bizarre.
OK.
Lemme guess.
You haven't told your dad yet.
Well...
I knew it!
Why haven't you told him?
There hasn't been "you, your dad, talk-talk-talking." There was talking.
There was definitely talking.
Really?
What did he say?
Uh...
What?
All right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!
You have got to stop messing around and deal with the problem!
She's right!
Abby, please.
This is exactly what fell on me the first time.
There's no way I'm bringing this up again.
No, he's not.
Runt!
Sorry!
I'm a gutless flip-flapper.
OK.
I'm sure there's a simple, logical explanation.
I mean, it could be a piece of weather balloon, or maybe it's part of some experimental communications satellite.
I don't care.
I want it out of my life, gone for good.
Everything back to normal.
Hey, remember when that icy blue stuff fell from the sky?
Everybody thought it was from space and stuff?
And it just turned out to be frozen pee from a jet airplane.
Yeah, that's right.
It's frozen pee.
Yeah.
It's frozen pee.
Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.
Could you stop saying that?
What?
Pee?

Tell him.
He can handle it.

Uh...
Gotta go, Dad!

I don't know.
Uh, yeah.
OK.
I know this looks bad, but there's an invisible spaceship right there with aliens who are here to invade Earth!
Let me show you.
Ooh, bad throw.
OK, let me try again.
Bad throw.
We all know I don't have a good arm, but there's these cloaking panels on the bottom.
They make it disappear.
One fell out of the sky and hit me right on the head.
Oh, it's the acorn thing all over again.
Eh, there's no story here.
At least we can sell the video to Chickens Gone Wild.
I'm telling ya, it was here!
No, wait!
There were aliens!
It's true!
They had eyes...
They're glowing and then tentacles!
And maps with planets with X's through them!
Aah!
Runt, that's enough!
Don't make Mommy take away your Streisand collection!
Mom?
You leave Barbra out of this!
Why can't you keep that child of yours under control?
What kind of parent are you?
I'm telling the truth.
Dad!
Dad!
I'm not making this up!
You gotta believe me this time.
No, son.
I don't.
I can't tell you how embarrassed I am, folks.
I'm really sorry about this, everyone.
Looks like this is just a big, crazy misunderstanding.
Well, other than the penny, this whole evening was a wash!
Mr.
Cluck, don't take it so hard.
No one blames you.
Reports of panic and mayhem are pouring in after yet another Chicken Little incident last night.
In one instance, a family of lemmings was sent running in fear, but unable to find a cliff, they instead began throwing themselves - From the nearest park bench.
Hello?
I'm sorry.
Hello?
I apologize.
Hello?
Give me a break!
What?
You were trampled?
That's terrible.
I thought rabbits' feet were supposed to be lucky.
You have hate mail.
Sorry.
That wasn't very funny.
You have more hate mail. - Hi.
What are you saying, sir?
Your hate mail box is full.
Oh, yes.
I do see the skywriting there.
Thank goodness the cloud blocked the last letter.
Hello?
Hey!
Watch your mouth.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'd like to see you try.
OK, I love you too, Mom.
Bye.
Hello?
Really.
Well...
If there was ever a time to talk to your dad... ...it's now.
It's too late for that.
It's too late, baby, now it's too late.
Though they really did try to make it.
Runt.
Just think about it.
Something inside has died and they just can't hide and they just can't fake it.
Oh, no, no.
Runt, I really just want to be alone right now.
Oh!
Abby!
Runt!
Fish!
Look!
There!
Look there!
Look there!
What is that thing?!
Look at that!
His name is Kirby?
They left him behind?
Darth Vader is Luke's father?
No, don't...
Come on, come on, don't cry.
We're here for you.
We're gonna do whatever it takes to get you back home.
Here, blow.
OK.
See, guys?
He's cool.
He was just freaked out.
That's all.
Ah-choo!
Whoa.
Run!
Those are your parents?
And they brought the galactic armada?
Watch out for the kid!
Don't hit him!
There you are.
Get in the car.
I gotta tell you something.
What?
I know, I know!
You were right!
Alien invasion.
I see that now.
Look up!
There it is!
Dad, you know, about that...
It's actually a rescue mission.
Rescue mission?
This alien kid was left and they're coming back to get him!
We have to help him, 'cause if we don't, who else will?
What?!
Ugh!
Forget it.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.
Son!
Son, come back!
Son!
Chicken Little!
Mr.
Cluck!
Wait!
He's telling the truth!
He is!
Given his track record, we understand why you don't believe him!

Look out!
Whew!
Chicken Little!
What?
Where's your head?
We gotta get outta here!
Come on!
Come...
You, with the running and the jumping!
Dad.
No, wait.
What are you guys doing?
We gotta get outta here!
It's like War of the Worlds out there!
Stop pulling!
Just listen to me for one second!
It's not dangerous!
We are under attack!
Will you two stop messing around and deal with the problem?
You're never there for me!
What?
OK, that's not what I had in mind, but...
You're never there for me.
I mean, you were when I won the game, but not when I thought the sky fell.
And not at the ball field and not now!
This is good!
Keep going.
Keep going!
You've been ashamed since the acorn thing.
We have to talk because Modern Mallard says avoiding closure can lead to molting.
I'm already small and I don't think I could handle being bald!
I...
I...
I didn't... ...realize, son.
I-I never meant to...
The acorn, the sky, I mean, the whole...
You're right.
You're right.
Y...
Your mom, she was...
You know, she was always good with stuff like this.
Me... ...I'm gonna need a lot of work.
But you need to know that I love you, no matter what.
And I'm sorry I...
And I'm sorry if I ever made you feel like that was something... ...you had to earn.
Uh... uh...
And we're good.
Let's go.
Let's go.
OK, Dad.
All we gotta do is return helpless little Kirby.
Return this whatever it is?
This is crazy!
Crazy!
Crazy wonderful!
Just tell me what you need me to do.
Do you really mean it?
You bet!
Anything, son.
Come on, Dad.
We've got a planet to save!
Crazy supportive.
That's me!
Ohh!
This thing likes to nibble, doesn't it?
By the way, I'd like to say I've always found you extremely attractive!
Now that's closure.
Wait!
Wait!
What's goin' on?!
Oh, they've given her an alien mind-wipe!
Aaah!
OK, son.
What do we do now?
Uh, OK.
This is a piece of cake, Dad.
All we have to do is take the kid down the street to the giant metal alien.
We surrender!
Here!
Take the key to the city!
Key to my car?
Tic Tac?
Forget plan A!
Uh-oh.
OK, OK, what now, son?
Who, by the way, I support 100 percent.
Uh, plan B?
Ha-ha!
Of course!
Plan B!
What is plan B?
What?
You have to go to the bathroom?
You want juice?
A snack?
Corn dog on a stick?
Want to play some golf?
What do you want?!
I stink at this.
I'm a horrible father.
No, no, I am.
Poo-tee-tah.
Oh.
Is that your parents?
Pooteetah, pooteetah.
That's it, Dad!
Plan B!
All we have to do is weave through traffic through town square while avoiding death rays from alien robots.
We get to Town Hall, climb up to the roof and give the kid back to its parents.
Yeah!
Charge!
Wow!
A-ha!
Now that's what I call takin' out the trash!
OK, son.
Now what?
Fire truck!
Plan C!
Runt, no!
Turn around!
Go back to Town Hall!
But they'll vaporize us!
You want me to do what?
Runt, just do it!
It'll work!
We'll survive!
I will survive?
Brake, Abby!
OK.
Floor it!
Boink.
Deploy ladder, Fish! ♪ I'll survive ♪ I will survive Hey, hey ♪ Plan D.
Plan D!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Thighs hurting.
Drumsticks burning.
But loving you!
Full support!
I can't get out!
Come back, son!
We can't go out this way!
It's dangerous.
No, Dad, I can do this!
It's too dangerous.
I can do this.
I can.
You gotta believe me this time.
I...
I do, son.
OK, hang on tight.
Yes!
Here's your kid!
Look over here!
Here's your kid!
He's OK!
He's all right!
Stop the invasion!
Son!
Son!
Aaaah!
I'm here, son!
Dad!
Look out!
Get away from my boy!
Get away!
The mighty Acorns...
Tic Tac?
Why did you take our child?
Hey, hey!
Just...
Just hold on there, buddy!
My son did not take your kid!
You were the one that left him behind!
That's bad parenting!
And I should know!
Silence!
Release the child!
OK.
OK, OK.
Sweetheart!
Oh, Kirby, I'm so happy to see you!
My darling!
That was close.
At least they're back together.
They got their kid.
You have violated intergalactic law 90210!
A charge punishable by immediate particle disintegration!
Oh, snap.
Hmm?
What's that?
Hmm.
I...
I don't quite...
Melvin, honey?
He's saying they're telling the truth.
It was just a misunderstanding.
Well, then.
This is awkward.
Yes, it is.
I suppose I should...
Put the big guns away?
Yes, yes.
Now put them down.
Of course.
And turn off your big voice.
But I don't...
Turn it off.
But...
But I don't get to use the big voice very often!
Melvin.
Yes, dear.
Hi.
Uh, anyone want to try the big voice?
Again, I cannot tell you how sorry we are for this whole misunderstanding.
Oh, dear goodness.
We are so very sorry.
We are.
And if it hadn't been for your son there, well, we might have vaporized the whole planet.
What?
Goodness!
What a shame that would have been.
Where else would we pick our acorns?
We stop on the way to the in-laws.
Every year.
Looked on all the other planets.
You only find them on Earth.
Just as it says here on your primitive graphic display.
That caught our eyes.
OK, everything's been put back to normal, except for this one, over here.
Hi, y'all!
Foxy? ♪ Lollipop, lollipop Oh, lolli lolli lolli ♪ Lollipop...
She got her brainwaves scrambled during reconstitution.
No worries!
We can put her back the way she was.
No!
She's perfect. ♪ Lollipop!
Lollipop!
I' Scary.
Whoops!
Darling!
Look at the time!
We better get a move on.
All right, then.
It was good meetin' ya.
Sorry for the whole full-scale invasion thing.
But, hey, I'm a dad.
You know how it is with your kids.
When they need ya, you do whatever it takes.
There goes that panel again.
Every year we come, this thing falls off.
Someday it's going to hit somebody on the head.
Nonsense!
You can't return the panel.
Now that's ridiculous.
You threw away the receipt again.
Silence!
Melvin, did you just try and use the big voice on me?
Um... uh...
Who we talkin' about?
So I'd like to see the movie they make about you now.
I just hope they stay true to what really happened.
Oh, son, these people are from Hollywood!
One thing they'll never do is mess with a good story.
Red alert!
Man your battle stations!
Status report, Mr.
Fish.
Commander Little, the evil Foxloxian Army has broken through the planet's atmosphere.
But that means...
Yes, I know.
The sky... is falling.
Commander Little!
No!
Please... call me... ...Ace.
Oh, Ace!
No!
I never intended to bring you into this...
Abby.
Runt, do you copy? - Yes, commander?
Runt, my friend, an alien fleet is about to invade Earth.
Civilization as we know it depends on me and, to a lesser extent... you.
So I've just got one question for you: Are you ready to rock?
Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low...
Raise your pork shield, Runt.
Prepare to engage.
Stay on target.
Stay on target!
Give 'em a taste of the other white meat!
Cap 'n!
Look out!
Runt!
Runt, are you a" right?
No, no.
Ya gotta go on without me, commander.
Just leave me some ammo, a little water, some chips if you have 'em.
This is amazingly accurate.
He was my good friend.
Oh, Abby.
At least I still have you...
Abby. - Ace!
Abby. - Ace!

Fear.
Treachery.
Bloodlust.
Thousands of years ago, these were the forces that ruled our world.
A world where prey were scared of predators.
And predators had an uncontrollable, biological urge... to maim, and maul, and...
Blood!
Blood!
Blood!
And death.
Back then, the world was divided in two.
Vicious predator... or meek prey.
But over time, we evolved.
And moved beyond our primitive, savage ways.
Now, predator and prey live in harmony.
And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities.
Yeah.
I don't have to cower in a herd anymore.
Instead, I can be an astronaut.
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.
Today, I can hunt for tax exemptions.
I'm gonna be an actuary!
And I can make the world a better place.
I am going to be... a police officer!
Bunny cop?
That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard.
It may seem impossible to small minds...
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.
But, just 211 miles away... stands the great city of Zootopia!
Where our ancestors first joined together in peace... and declared that anyone can be anything!
Thank you and good night!
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy?
Nope.
Well, we gave up on our dreams and we settled.
Right, Bon?
Oh, yes, that's right, Stu.
We settled hard.
See, that's the beauty of complacency, Jude.
If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail.
I like trying actually.
What you father means, hon... is it's gonna be difficult, impossible even, for you to become a police officer.
Right.
There's never been a bunny cop.
Bunnies don't do that.
Never.
Never.
Then, I guess I'll have to be the first one.
Because I am gonna make the world a better place.
Or, heck, you know, you want to talk about making the world a better place... no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer.
Yes!
Your dad, me... your 275 brothers and sisters.
We're changing the world!
One carrot at a time.
Amen to that.
Carrot farming is a noble profession.
Just putting the seeds in the ground.
At one with the soil.
Just getting covered in dirt.
You get it, honey.
It's great to have dreams.
Yeah.
Just as long as you don't believe in them too much.
Where'd the heck she go?
Give me your tickets right now... or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.
Cut it out, Gideon!
What are you gonna do?
Cry?
Hey!
You heard her.
Cut it out.
Nice costume, loser.
What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop?
Kindly return my friend's tickets.
Come and get them.
But watch out, because I'm a fox, and like you said in your dumb little stage play... us predators used to eat prey.
And that killer instinct is still in our "Dunnah." I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced "DNA." Don't tell me what I know, Travis.
You don't scare me, Gideon.
You scared now?
Look at her nose twitch!
She is scared!
Cry little baby bunny.
Cry, cry...
You don't know when to quit, do you?
I want you to remember this moment... the next time you think you will ever be anything more than just a stupid... carrot-farming, dumb bunny.
That looks bad.
Are you okay, Judy?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
Here you go.
Wow!
You got our tickets!
You're awesome, Judy!
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking about.
Well, he was right about one thing.
I don't know when to quit.
Listen up, cadets.
Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits. 15 YEARS LATER Tundratown...
Sahara Square...
Rainforest District, to name a few.
You're gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets, or guess what?
You'll be dead!
Scorching sandstorm!
You're dead, Bunny Bumpkin! 1,000-foot fall!
You're dead, Carrot Face!
Frigid ice wall!
You're dead, Farm Girl!
Enormous criminal.
You're dead.
Dead, dead, dead!
Filthy toilet!
You're dead, Fluff Butt.
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!
There's never been a bunny cop.
Never.
Never.
Just a stupid, carrot-farming dumb bunny.
As mayor of Zootopia, I am proud to announce... that my Mammal Inclusion Initiative has produced... its first police academy graduate.
Valedictorian of her class, ZPD's very first rabbit officer...
Judy Hopps.
Oh, gosh.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.
Oh, yes.
Right!
Thank you.
Yay, Judy!
Judy... it is my great privilege to officially assign you... to the heart of Zootopia: Precinct One.
City Center.
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.
I won't let you down.
This has been my dream since I was a kid.
It's a real proud day for us little guys.
Bellwether, make room, will you?
Come on.
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!
Officer Hopps, right here!
Look this way please!
Hold still.
Smile!
We're real proud of you, Judy.
Yeah.
Scared, too.
Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.
I mean, Zootopia.
So far away.
Such a big city.
Guys...
I've been working for this my whole life.
We know.
And we're just a little excited for you, but terrified.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
And also bears.
We have bears to fear, too.
Say nothing of lions and wolves.
Wolves?
Weasels.
You play cribbage with a weasel.
And he cheats like there's no tomorrow.
You know what, pretty much all predators.
And Zootopia's full of them.
Oh, Stu.
And foxes are the worst.
Actually, your father does have a point there.
It's in their biology.
Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?
When I was nine.
Gideon Grey was a jerk who happened to be a fox.
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.
Sure, we all do.
Absolutely.
But just in case... we made you a little care package to take with you.
And I put some snacks in there.
This is fox deterrent.
Yeah, that's safe, to have that.
This is fox repellent.
The deterrent and the repellent, that's all she needs.
Check this out!
For goodness sake.
She has no need for a fox Taser, Stu.
Come on.
When is there not a need for a fox Taser?
Okay, look!
I will take this, to make you stop talking.
Terrific!
Everyone wins!
Arriving, Zootopia Express.
Okay, gotta go!
Bye!
Bye, Judy!
I love you guys.
Love you, too.
Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.
Oh, Stu, pull it together.
Bye, everybody!
Bye-bye, Judy!
Bye, Judy!
I love you!
Bye!
Bye!
Goodbye!
I messed up tonight I lost another fight Lost to myself But I'll just start again I keep falling down I keep on hitting the ground But I always get up now To see what's next Birds don't just fly They fall down and get up Nobody learns without getting it wrong I won't give up No I won't give in Till I reach the end And then I'll start again No I won't leave I want to try everything I want to try even though I could fail I won't give up No, I won't give in Till I reach the end Then I'll start again No, I won't leave I want to try everything I want to try even though I could fail Try everything Try everything Try everything I'll keep making those new mistakes And I'll keep on making them every day Those new mistakes Try everything Try everything Try everything Try everything I'm Gazelle.
Welcome to Zootopia.
Welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.
Luxury apartments with charm.
Complimentary delousing once a month.
Don't lose your key.
Thank you.
Hi!
I'm Judy, your new neighbor.
Yeah?
Well, we're loud.
Don't expect us to apologize for it.
Greasy walls.
Hey, shut up!
Rickety bed.
You shut up!
You shut up!
Will you shut up?
Crazy neighbors.
I said, "Shut up!" I love it!
Shut your mouth, shut up.
Come on!
He bared his teeth first!
Excuse me.
Down here.
Hi.
O-M-Goodness!
They really did hire a bunny!
What!
I gotta tell you, you are even cuter than I thought you'd be!
You probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny "cute"... but when other animals do it... it's a little...
I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser... the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby, donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.
No, it's okay.
Oh, you've actually got...
There's a...
In your neck.
The fold.
Where?
Oh!
There you went, you little dickens!
I should get to roll call, which way do I...?
Bullpen's over there to the left.
Great.
Thank you.
That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive.
Hey, Officer Hopps.
You ready to make the world a better place?
Atten-hut!
All right!
Everybody sit.
I've got three items on the docket.
First... we need to acknowledge the elephant in the room.
Francine...
Happy birthday.
Number two.
There are some new recruits with us I should introduce... but I'm not going to.... because I don't care.
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.
All predators, from a giant polar bear to a teensy little otter.
And City Hall is right up my tail to find them.
This is priority number one.
Assignments.
Officers Grizzoli...
Fangmeyer, Delgato.
Your teams take missing mammals from the Rainforest District.
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.
Your teams take Sahara Square.
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.
Tundratown.
And finally, our first bunny...
Officer Hopps.
Parking Duty.
Dismissed.
Parking duty?
Chief!
Chief Bogo?
Sir, you said there were 14 missing mammal cases.
So?
So, I can handle one.
You probably forgot, but I was top of my class at the Academy.
Didn't forget.
Just don't care.
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.
Well, then writing 100 tickets a day should be easy. 100 tickets.
I'm not gonna write 100 tickets.
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.
Before noon.
Boom! 200 tickets before noon! 201.
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!
Where'd he go?
I don't know what you're doing skulking around during daylight hours... but I don't want any trouble in here.
So, hit the road.
I'm not looking for any trouble either, sir.
I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop... for my little boy.
You want the red or the blue, pal?
I'm such a...
Come on, kid.
Back up.
Listen, buddy.
What?
There aren't any fox ice cream joints... in your part of town?
No, no.
There are.
There are.
It's just, my boy, this goofy little stinker... he loves all things elephant.
Wants to be one when he grows up.
Is that adorable?
Who the heck am I to crush his little dreams?
Right?
You probably can't read, fox, but the sign says... "We reserve the right to refuse service... "...to anyone." So, beat it.
You're holding up the line.
Hello?
Excuse me.
You're gonna have to wait your turn like everyone else, meter maid.
Actually, I'm an officer.
Just had a quick question.
Are your customers aware they're getting snot and mucus... with their cookies and cream?
What are you talking about?
I don't want to cause you any trouble, but I believe scooping ice cream... with an ungloved trunk is a Class 3 health code violation.
Which is kind of a big deal.
Of course, I could let you off with a warning... if you were to glove those trunks and, I don't know... finish selling this nice dad and his son a...
What was it?
A Jumbo Pop.
Please.
A Jumbo Pop. $15.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Oh, no.
Are you kidding me?
I don't have my wallet.
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck.
That's the truth.
Oh, boy.
I'm sorry, pal.
Got to be about the worst birthday ever.
Please don't be mad at me.
Thanks anyway.
Keep the change.
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind, really.
Can I pay you back?
Oh, no, My treat.
It just...
You know, it burns me up to see folks with such backward attitudes toward foxes.
I just wanna say you're a great dad and just a... a real articulate fella.
Well, that is high praise.
It's rare that I find someone so non-patronizing.
Officer...
Hopps.
Mister...
Wilde.
Nick Wilde.
And you, little guy...
You want to be an elephant when you grow up?
You be an elephant.
Because this is Zootopia.
Anyone can be anything.
Boy, I tell him that all the time.
All right, here you go.
Two paws.
Yeah.
Look at that smile.
That's a "happy birthday" smile.
All right, give her a little bye-bye toot-toot.
Toot-toot!
Bye, now.
Goodbye!
Hey, little Toot-Toot...
Popsicles!
Get your popsicles!
Lumber delivery.
What's with the color?
The color?
That's red wood. 39, 40.
There you go.
Way to work that diaper, big guy.
Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy?
You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite your face off.
Ciao.
Well.
I stood up for you, and you lied to me.
You liar!
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
And I'm not the liar.
He is.
Hey!
All right, slick Nick, you're under arrest.
Really?
For what?
Gee, I don't know.
How about selling food without a permit.
Transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines.
False advertising.
Permit.
Receipt of declared commerce.
And I didn't falsely advertise anything.
Take care.
You told that mouse the popsicle sticks were redwood!
That's right. "Red wood." With a space in the middle.
Wood that is red.
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.
You're gonna want to refrain from calling me Carrots.
My bad.
I just naturally assumed you came from some little carrot-choked Podunk, no?
No!
Podunk is in Deerbrooke County, and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.
Okay.
Tell me if this story sounds familiar.
Naive little hick with good grades and big ideas... decides, "Hey, look at me!
I'm gonna move to Zootopia... where predators and prey live in harmony and sing "Kumbaya." Only to find, whoopsie... we don't all get along.
And that dream of becoming a big city cop?
Double whoopsie.
She's a meter maid.
And, whoopsie number three-sie... no one cares about her or her dreams.
And soon enough, those dreams die and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor... living in a box under a bridge... till finally she has no choice but to go back home... with that cute, fuzzy-wuzzy little tail between her legs... to become...
You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?
So how about a carrot farmer.
That sound about right?
Be careful, now, or it won't just be your dreams getting crushed.
Hey!
No one tells me what I can or can't be!
Especially not some jerk... who never had the guts to try to be anything more than a popsicle hustler.
All right, look.
Everyone comes to Zootopia... thinking they can be anything they want.
Well, you can't.
You can only be what you are.
Sly fox, dumb bunny.
I'm not a dumb bunny.
Right.
And that's not wet cement.
You'll never be a real cop.
You're a cute meter maid, though.
Maybe a supervisor one day.
Hang in there.
You can't do nothing right, babe I'm a loser Oh, hey, it's my parents.
Oh, there she is!
Hi, sweetheart!
Hey there, Jude the dude.
How was your first day on the force?
It was real great.
Yeah?
Everything you ever hoped?
Absolutely.
And more.
Everyone's so nice and...
I feel like I'm making a difference.
Wait a second.
Holy cripes, Bonnie, look at that.
Oh, my sweet heaven!
Judy, are you a meter maid?
This?
No!
Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing.
It's the safest job on the force!
She's not a real cop.
Our prayers have been answered!
Glorious day!
Meter maid!
Meter maid!
Meter maid!
Meter maid!
Dad.
Dad.
Dad!
It's been a really long day.
I should really...
That's right, you get some rest.
Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.
Bye-bye.
Buh-bye.
Hey, buddy, turn down that depressing music.
Leave the meter maid alone.
Didn't you hear her conversation?
She feels like a failure!
Oh, shut up!
You shut up!
You shut up!
You shut up!
Tomorrow's another day.
Yeah, but it might be worse!
I was 30 seconds over!
You're a real hero, lady!
My mommy says she wishes you were dead.
Uncool, rabbit.
My tax dollars pay your salary.
I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.
Hey, hey!
You, bunny!
Sir.
If you have a grievance, you may contest your citation in traffic court.
What are you talking about?
My shop!
It was just robbed!
Look!
He's getting away!
Are you a cop or not?
Yes!
Don't worry, sir!
I've got this!
Stop!
Stop, in the name of the law!
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!
Coming through!
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-31.
I got dibs!
Officer Hopps.
I am in pursuit!
You!
Freeze!
Hey, meter maid!
Wait for the real cops!
Stop!
Sorry.
Coming through.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Pardon.
Bon voyage-e, flat foot!
Hey, stop right there!
Have a donut, copper!
Oh, my God.
Did you see those leopard print jeggings?
I love your hair.
Thank you.
Come to papa.
You're gonna have to be patient and wait in line just like everyone else...
Mrs.
Otterton.
Okay?
I popped the weasel!
Hopps!
Abandoning your post.
Inciting a scurry.
Reckless endangerment of rodents.
But, to be fair... you did stop a master criminal from stealing two dozen moldy onions.
Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions.
Those are a crocus varietal called midnicampum holicithias.
They're a Class-C botanical, sir.
I grew up in a family where plant husbandry was kind of a thing.
Shut your tiny mouth now!
Sir, I got the bad guy.
That's my job.
Your job is putting tickets on parked cars!
Chief, Mrs.
Otterton's here to see you again.
Not now.
Okay, I just didn't know if you'd want to take it this time.
She seems really upset.
Not now!
Sir...
I don't want to be a meter maid, I want to be a real cop.
Do you think the mayor asked me what I wanted when he assigned you to me?
But, sir, if...
Life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song... and your insipid dreams magically come true.
So, let it go.
Chief Bogo, please.
Five minutes of your time.
I'm sorry, sir.
I tried to stop her.
She is super-slippery.
I gotta go sit down.
Ma'am, as I've told you, we're doing everything we can.
My husband has been missing for 10 days.
His name is Emmitt Otterton.
Yes, I know.
He's a florist.
We have two beautiful children.
He would never just disappear.
Ma'am, our detectives are very busy.
Please.
There's got to be someone to find my Emmitt.
Mrs.
Otterton...
I will find him.
Thank you.
Bless you.
Bless you, little bunny.
Take this.
Find my Emmitt.
Bring him home... to me and my babies, please.
Mrs.
Otterton, please wait out here.
Of course.
Thank you both so much.
One second.
You're fired.
What?
Why?
Insubordination!
Now.
I'm going to open this door... and you're going to tell that otter you're a former meter maid... with delusions of grandeur... who will not be taking the case!
I just heard Officer Hopps is taking the case.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether.
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is really starting to pay off.
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna be so jazzed!
No, let's not tell the Mayor just yet.
And I've sent it and it is done, so I did do that.
Well, I'd say the case is in good hands.
Us little guys really need to stick together, right?
Like glue.
Good one.
Just call me if you ever need anything, okay?
You've always got a friend at City Hall, Judy.
All right, bye-bye.
Thank you, ma'am.
I will give you 48 hours.
Yes!
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.
Okay.
But, you strike out, you resign.
Okay.
Deal!
Splendid.
Clawhauser will give you the complete case file.
Here you go.
One missing otter.
That's it?
Yikes!
That is the smallest case file I've ever seen.
Leads, none.
Witnesses, none.
And you're not in the computer system yet, so resources, none!
I hope you didn't stake your career on cracking this one!
Okay.
Last known sighting.
Can I just borrow...
Thank you.
Popsicle?
The murder weapon.
Get your popsicle.
Yeah.
Because that...
What does that mean?
It means...
I have a lead.
Hi!
Hello?
It's me, again!
Hey, it's Officer Toot-Toot.
No.
Actually, it's Officer Hopps... and I'm here to ask you some questions about a case.
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?
It wasn't me.
Hey, Carrots, you're going to wake the baby.
I gotta get to work.
This is important, sir.
I think your $10 worth of popsicles can wait.
I make 200 bucks a day, Fluff! 365 days a year, since I was 12.
And time is money.
Hop along.
Please, just look at the picture.
You sold Mr.
Otterton that popsicle, right?
Do you know him?
I know everybody.
And I also know that, somewhere... there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal, so why don't you get back to your box?
Fine.
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.
Did you just boot my stroller?
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.
For what?
Hurting your feelings?
Felony Tax Evasion.
Yeah, $200 a day, 365 days a year, since you were 12.
That's two decades, so times 20, which is $1,460,000, I think.
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny, but we are good at multiplying.
Anyway, according to your tax forms... you reported, let me see here... zero!
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense.
Five years jail time.
Well, it's my word against yours. 200 bucks a day, Fluff! 365 days a year, since I was 12.
Actually, it's your word against yours.
And if you want this pen, you're going to help me find this poor, missing otter... or the only place you'll be selling popsicles is the prison cafeteria.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
She hustled you.
She hustled you good!
You a cop now, Nick.
You gonna need one of these.
Have fun... working with the fuzz!
Start talking.
I don't know where he is.
I only saw where he went.
Great.
Let's go.
It's not exactly a place for... a cute little bunny.
Don't call me cute.
Get in the car.
Okay.
You're the boss.
Hi.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
My name is...
You know, I'm going to hit the pause button right there... because we're all good on Bunny Scout cookies.
No.
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal, Emmitt Otterton, right here... who may have frequented this establishment.
Yeah, old Emmitt.
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.
But, hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.
I'd be happy to take you back.
Thank you so much.
I'd appreciate that more than you can imagine, it would be such...
You are naked!
For sure, we're a naturalist club.
Yeah.
In Zootopia, anyone can be anything.
These guys, they be naked.
Nangi's just on the other side of the Pleasure Pool.
Oh, boy.
Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because if so, there is no shame in calling it quits.
Yes, there is.
Boy, that's the spirit.
Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird... but you know what I say is weird?
Clothes on animals!
Here we go.
As you can see, Nangi's an elephant, so she'll totally remember everything.
Hey, Nangi.
These dudes have some questions about Emmitt the otter.
Who?
Emmitt Otterton?
Been coming to your yoga class for like... 6 years?
I have no memory of this beaver.
He's an otter, actually.
He was here a couple Wednesdays ago, remember?
No.
Yeah, he was wearing a green cable-knit sweater vest... and a new pair of corduroy slacks.
And a paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.
Real tight.
Remember that, Nangi?
No.
And we both walked him out, and he got into this big old white car with a silver trim.
Needed a tune-up.
The third cylinder wasn't firing.
Remember that, Nangi?
No.
You didn't happen to catch the license plate number, did you?
Oh, for sure.
It was 2-9...
T-H-D... 0-3. 0-3.
Wow.
This is a lot of great info.
Thank you.
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.
Well, I had a ball.
You are welcome for the clue... and seeing as how any moron can run a plate, I will take that pen and bid you adieu.
The plate.
I can't run a plate.
I'm not in the system yet.
Give me the pen, please.
What was it you said? "Any moron can run a plate"?
Gosh.
If only there were a moron around who were up to the task.
Rabbit, I did what you asked!
You can't keep me on the hook forever.
Not forever.
Well, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case.
So can you run the plate or not?
Actually, I just remembered...
I have a pal at the DMV.
Flash is the fastest guy in there.
If you need something done, he's on it.
I hope so.
We are really fighting the clock and every minute counts.
Wait.
They're all sloths?
You said this was going to be quick!
Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast?
I thought in Zootopia, anyone could be anything.
Flash, Flash, hundred-yard dash.
Buddy, it's nice to see you.
Nice to... see you... too.
Hey, Flash, I'd love you to meet my friend.
Darling, I've forgotten your name.
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD, how are you?
I am... doing... just...
Fine? ...as well as...
I can... be.
What...
Hang in there. ...can I... do...
I was hoping you could run a... ...for you...
Well, I was hoping you could... ...today?
Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us.
We are in a really big hurry.
Sure.
What's the... plate... 2-9-T... ...number? 2-9-T-H-D-0-3 Two... nine...
T-H-D-0-3. ...T...
H-D-0-3. ...H...
D-0-3. ...D... 0-3. ...0... 3.
Hey, Flash, want to hear a joke?
No!
Sure.
Okay.
What do you call a three-humped camel?
I don't... know.
What... do... you call... a...
Three-humped camel. ...three-humped... camel?
Pregnant.
Yes, very funny, very funny.
Can we please just focus on the...
Hey...
Wait, wait, wait! ...Priscilla!
Oh, no!
Yes...
Flash?
What... do...
No! ...you call a...
A three-humped camel? "Pregnant!" Okay, great, we got it. ...three... humped...
Here...
Yeah.
Hurry. ...you...
Thank you. "2-9-T-H-D-0-3." ...go.
It's registered to Tundratown Limo Service.
A limo took Otterton, and the limo's in Tundratown!
Way to hustle, bud.
I love you.
I owe you.
Hurry!
We gotta beat the rush hour, and...
It's night?
Closed.
Great.
And I will bet you you don't have a warrant to get in.
Darn it.
It's a bummer.
You wasted the day on purpose.
Madam, I have a fake badge.
I would never impede your pretend investigation.
It's not a pretend investigation.
Look, see?
See him?
This otter is missing.
Then they should've gotten a real cop to find him.
What is your problem?
Does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life?
It does. 100%.
Now, since you're sans warrant...
I guess we're... done?
Fine.
We are done.
Here's your pen.
Hey!
First off, you throw like a bunny.
Second, you're a very sore loser.
See you later, Officer Fluff.
So sad this is over.
I wish I could've helped more.
The thing is, you don't need a warrant if you have probable cause... and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.
So you're helping plenty.
Come on. 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
This is it!
Polar bear fur.
Oh, my God!
What?
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.
But on CD.
Who still uses CDs?
Carrots, if your otter was here, he had a very bad day.
Those are claw marks.
You ever seen anything like this?
No.
Wait, look.
This is him, Emmitt Otterton.
He was definitely here.
What do you think happened?
Now, wait a minute.
Polar bear fur, Rat Pack music, fancy cup?
I know whose car this is.
We got to go.
Why?
Whose car is it?
The most feared crime-boss in Tundratown.
They call him Mr.
Big.
And he does not like me.
So we gotta go!
I'm not leaving.
This is a crime scene.
It's gonna be an even bigger crime scene if Mr.
Big finds me here... so we're leaving right now.
Raymond!
And is that Kevin?
Long time, no see.
And, speaking of "no see," how about you forget you saw me?
For old times' sake?
That's a no.
What did you do that made Mr.
Big so mad at you?
I may have sold him a very expensive wool rug... that was made from the fur of a skunk... ...'s butt.
Sweet cheese and crackers.
Is that Mr.
Big?
No.
What about him?
Is that him?
No!
That's got to be him.
Stop talking, stop talking, stop talking!
Mr.
Big, sir.
This is a simple...
Yeah.
This is a simple misunderstanding.
You come here, unannounced, on the day my daughter is to be married.
Well, actually, we were brought here against our will, so...
The point is, I did not know that it was your car... and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding.
I trusted you, Nicky.
I welcomed you into my home.
We broke bread together.
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.
And how did you repay my generosity?
With a rug made from the butt of a skunk.
A skunk-butt rug.
You disrespected me.
You disrespected my Gram-mama, who I buried in that skunk butt rug.
I told you never to show your face here again but here you are... snooping around with this...
What are you?
A performer?
What's with the costume?
Sir.
I am a...
Mime!
She is a mime.
This... mime cannot speak.
You can't speak if you're a mime.
No, I am a cop.
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.
And my evidence puts him in your car.
So intimidate me all you want.
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do.
Then I have only one request.
Say hello to Gram-mama.
Ice 'em.
I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!
And you never will.
Please!
No, no, no!
If you're mad at me about the rug, I've got more rugs!
Daddy!
It's time for our dance!
What did we say?
No icing anyone at my wedding!
I have to, baby.
Daddy has to.
Ice 'em.
No, no no!
Wait.
Please!
She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!
From that giant donut.
This bunny?
Yeah!
Hi!
Hi.
I love your dress.
Thank you.
Put 'em down.
You've done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter.
I will take your kindness and pay it forward.
Otterton is my florist.
He's like a part of the family.
He had something important he wanted to discuss.
That's why I sent that car to pick him up.
But he never arrived.
Because he was attacked.
No.
He attacked.
Otterton?
Otterton.
He went crazy.
Ripped up the car, scared my driver half to death... and disappeared into the night.
But he's a sweet little otter.
My child, we may be evolved, but deep down... we are still animals.
You want to find Otterton, talk to the driver of that car.
His name is Manchas... lives in the Rainforest District.
Only he can tell you more.
Mr.
Manchas?
Judy Hopps, ZPD.
We just wanna know what happened to Emmitt Otterton.
You... should be asking... what happened to me.
A teensy otter did that?
What happened?
He was an animal.
Down... on all fours.
He was a savage!
There was no warning.
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.
Over and over.
The Night Howlers.
So you know about the Night Howlers, too?
Good.
Good, good.
Because the Night Howlers are exactly what we are here to talk about.
Right?
Yup.
So, you just open the door... and tell us what you know... and we will tell you what we know.
Okay?
Okay.
Clever fox.
Mr.
Manchas?
Buddy?
Are you... okay?
Run.
Run!
What is wrong with him?
I don't know!
Jump!
Come on!
Head down!
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.
Are you familiar with Gazelle, greatest singer of our lifetime, angel with horns?
Okay, hold on.
Keep watching.
Who's that beside her?
Who is it?
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Benjamin Clawhauser.
It's me!
Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!
It's not, it's just a new app.
Hold on a second.
Clawhauser!
Listen to me, we have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!
Vine and Tuh-junja!
It's "Tuh-hunga!" Okay, we're sending backup!
Hopps?
Hopps!
There!
Head for the sky trams!
Get in!
Carrots.
Carrots!
Go!
No, no, no!
Buddy.
One predator to another...
Now, I can tell you're a little tense... so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space!
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!
I'm gonna let go!
No, you, what?
One, two...
Carrots.
You saved my life.
Well.
That's what we do at the ZPD.
Well, this should be good.
I thought this was just a missing mammal case... but it's way bigger.
Mr.
Otterton did not just disappear.
I believe he and this jaguar, they went savage, sir.
Savage?
This isn't the Stone Age, Hopps.
Animals don't "go savage." I thought so, too, until I saw this.
What?
He was right here.
The "savage" jaguar?
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!
Or, maybe any aggressive predator looks savage to you rabbits.
Let's go!
Wait, sir.
I'm not the only one who saw him.
Nick!
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?
He was a key witness, and I...
Two days to find the otter... or you quit.
That was the deal.
Badge.
But, sir, we...
Badge!
No.
What did you say, fox?
Sorry.
What I said was, "no." She will not be giving you that badge.
Look, you give her a clown vest and a three-wheeled joke-mobile... and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?
Yeah.
No wonder she needed to get help from a fox.
None of you guys were gonna help her, were you?
Here's the thing, Chief.
You gave her the 48 hours... so, technically, we still have... 10 left to find our Mr.
Otterton... and that is exactly what we're gonna do.
So, if you'll excuse us, we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack.
Good day.
Officer Hopps.
Thank you.
Never let them see that they get to you.
So... things do get to you?
No, I mean, not anymore... but I was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once.
Har-har.
No, it's true.
I think I was 8, or maybe 9... and all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.
So, my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand-new uniform... because, by God, I was gonna fit in.
Even if I was the only predator in the troop.
The only fox.
Okay, Nick.
I was gonna be part of a pack.
Ready for initiation?
Yeah.
Pretty much born ready.
I was so proud.
Okay.
Now, raise your right paw and deliver the oath.
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave... loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.
Even though you're a fox?
What?
No!
What did I do wrong, you guys?
No, please!
Tell me!
What did I do wrong?
What did I do?
If you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle... you're even dumber than you look!
Aw, is he gonna cry?
I learned two things that day.
One...
I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me.
And two?
If the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy... there's no point in trying to be anything else.
Nick, you are so much more than that.
Boy, look at that traffic down there.
How about we go out to Chuck in Traffic Central.
Chuck, how are things looking on the Jam Cams?
Nick, I'm glad you told me.
The Jam Cams.
Seriously.
It's okay.
No, no, no.
There are traffic cameras everywhere!
All over the canopy!
Whatever happened to that jaguar...
The traffic cams would have caught it!
Bingo!
Pretty sneaky, slick!
However, if you didn't have access to the system before...
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now.
No.
But I have a friend at City Hall who might.
Sir, if we could just review these very important...
Sir...
I'm so sorry.
Sir!
Okay.
I heard you, Bellwether.
Just take care of it.
Please.
And clear my afternoon.
I'm going out.
No, no!
But, sir, you do have a meeting with Herds and Grazing.
Sir, if I could just...
Oh, mutton chops.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether?
We need your help.
We just need to get into the traffic cam database.
So fluffy!
Hey!
Sheep never let me get this close.
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!
It's like cotton candy.
Stop it!
Where to?
Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga.
There!
Traffic cams for the whole city.
This is so exciting, actually!
I never get to do anything this important.
But you're the Assistant Mayor of Zootopia.
I'm more of a glorified secretary.
I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote.
But he did give me that nice mug.
Feels good to be appreciated.
Smell-wether!
That's a fun little name he likes to use.
I called him Lion-fart once.
He did not care for that.
Let me tell you, it was not a good day for me.
Yes, sir?
I thought you were going to cancel my afternoon!
Oh, dear.
I better go.
Let me know what you find.
It was really nice for me to be...
While we're young, Smell-wether!
You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself?
Shush.
Okay, traffic cams.
Tujunga, Tujunga...
We're in.
Who are these guys?
Timberwolves.
Look at these dumb-dumbs.
Bet you a nickel one of them is gonna howl.
And there it is.
What is it with wolves and the howling?
It's like...
Howlers.
Night Howlers.
That's what Manchas was afraid of!
Wolves!
The wolves are the Night Howlers.
If they took Manchas...
I'll bet they took Otterton, too.
All we gotta do is find out where they went.
Wait, where did they go?
If I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal... which I never have...
I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.
Which would put them out... right there.
Well, look at you, Junior Detective.
You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop.
How dare you.
Acacia Alley?
Ficus Underpass.
South Canyon.
They're heading out of town.
Where does that road go?
Gary, quit it!
You're gonna start a howl.
I didn't start it!
Come on.
You are a clever bunny.
It looks like this was a hospital.
You know, after you.
You're the cop.
Okay, all clear.
All this equipment is brand new.
Carrots.
Claw marks.
Yeah, huge claw marks.
What kind of...
Mr.
Manchas.
It's him.
We found our otter.
Mr.
Otterton.
My name is Officer Judy Hopps.
Your wife sent me to find you.
We're gonna get you out of here now.
Or not.
Guess he's in no rush to get home to the missus. 11, 12, 13, 14...
Not including Manchas, it's 14.
Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files.
They're all here.
All the missing mammals are right here.
Enough!
I don't want excuses, Doctor!
I want answers.
Mayor Lionheart, please.
We're doing everything we can.
Really?
Because I got a dozen and a half animals here who have gone off-the-rails crazy... and you can't tell me why.
Now, I'd call that awfully far from "doing everything." Sir... it may be time to consider their biology.
What?
What do you mean "biology?" The only animals going savage are predators.
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.
Great idea.
Tell the public.
And how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor... who is a lion?
I'll be ruined!
Well, what does Chief Bogo say?
Chief Bogo doesn't know.
And we are going to keep it that way.
No, no, no!
Someone's here.
Sir, you need to go, now!
Security!
Sweep the area!
Great!
We're dead.
We're dead.
That's it.
I'm dead, you're dead.
Everybody's dead!
Can you swim?
What?
Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim.
Why?
Carrots!
Hopps!
Judy!
We gotta tell Bogo!
Wow!
You are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.
Chief Bogo!
Not now!
Wait, is that Gazelle?
No.
I'm Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer.
You have the app too?
Chief!
Clawhauser, can't you see I'm working on the missing mammal cases?
Yes of course!
About that, sir.
Officer Hopps just called.
She found all of them.
Wow!
I'm impressed.
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right to remain silent.
Anything...
You don't understand.
I was trying to protect the city!
You were just trying to protect your job.
No.
Listen, we still don't know why this is happening.
It could destroy Zootopia.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Ladies and gentlemammals. 14 mammals went missing... and all 14 have been found by our newest recruit... who will speak to you in a moment.
But first, let me remind you...
I'm so nervous.
Okay.
Press Conference 101.
You wanna look smart?
Answer their question with your own question... and then answer that question.
Like this. "Excuse me.
Officer Hopps, what can you tell us about the case?" "Well, was this a tough case? "Yes.
Yes, it was." You see?
You should be there with me.
We did this together.
Well, am I a cop?
No.
No, I am not.
Funny you should say that, because I've been thinking...
It would be nice to have a partner.
Here.
In case you need something to write with.
At twenty-two hundred hours, we found all these missing animals...
Officer Hopps, it's time.
They appear to be in good health, physically, if not emotionally.
So now, I'll turn things over to the officer who cracked the case.
Officer Judy Hopps.
Officer Hopps!
Officer Hopps!
Over here!
Yes?
What can you tell us about the animals that went savage?
Well, the animals in question...
Are they all different species?
Yes.
Yes, they are.
Okay, so what is the connection?
All we know is that they are all members of the predator family.
So, predators are the only ones going savage?
That is accurate.
Yes.
Why is this happening?
We still don't know.
It may have something to do with biology.
What do you mean by that?
A biological component.
You know, something in their DNA.
In their DNA?
Can you elaborate on that, please?
Yes, what I mean is, thousands of years ago... predators survived through their aggressive... hunting instincts.
For whatever reason... they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.
Of course they did.
Aw, is he gonna cry?
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?
It is possible.
So we must be vigilant.
And we at the ZPD are prepared and are here to protect you.
Will more mammals go savage?
What is being done to protect us?
Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.
That's all the time that we have.
No more questions.
Was I okay?
You did fine.
That went so fast.
I didn't get a chance to mention you, or say anything about how we...
I think you said plenty.
What do you mean? "Clearly there's a biological component?" "These predators may be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways?" Are you serious?
I just stated the facts of the case.
I mean it's not like a bunny could go savage.
Right.
But a fox could?
Nick, stop it.
You're not like them.
Oh, there's a "them" now?
You know what I mean.
You're not that kind of predator.
The kind that needs to be muzzled?
The kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellent?
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met.
So let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?
Do you think I might go nuts?
Do you think I might go savage?
Do you think I might try to... eat you?
I knew it.
Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me.
Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.
No.
Nick.
Nick!
Officer Hopps!
Were you just threatened by that predator?
No, he's my friend.
We can't even trust our own friends?
That is not what I said!
Please!
Are we safe?
Have any foxes gone savage?
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.
A caribou is in critical condition, the victim of a mauling... by a savage polar bear.
This, the 27th such attack, comes just one week... after ZPD Officer Judy Hopps connected the violence to traditionally predatory animals.
Meanwhile, a peace rally organized by pop star Gazelle... was marred by protest.
Go back to the forest, predator!
I'm from the savanna!
Zootopia is a unique place.
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city... where we celebrate our differences.
This is not the Zootopia I know.
The Zootopia I know is better than this.
We don't just blindly assign blame.
We don't know why these attacks keep happening... but it is irresponsible to label all predators as savages.
That's not my Emmitt.
We cannot let fear divide us.
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.
Come on, Hopps.
The new mayor wants to see us.
The mayor?
Why?
It would seem you've arrived.
Clawhauser?
What are you doing?
They thought it would be better... if a predator such as myself wasn't the first face that you see... when you walk into the ZPD.
What?
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.
It's by the boiler.
Hopps!
I don't understand.
Our city is 90% prey, Judy... and right now they're just really scared.
You're a hero to them.
They trust you.
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD.
I'm not a hero.
I came here to make the world a better place... but I think I broke it.
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.
The world has always been broken, that's why we need good cops.
Like you.
With all due respect, sir, a good cop... is supposed to serve and protect.
Help the city.
Not tear it apart.
I don't deserve this badge.
Hopps...
Judy, you've worked so hard to get here.
It's what you wanted since you were a kid.
You can't quit.
Thank you for the opportunity.
A dozen carrots.
Thanks.
Have a nice day.
Come on.
Hey, there, Jude.
Jude the dude.
Remember that one?
How we doing?
I'm fine.
You are not fine.
Your ears are droopy.
Why did I think I could make a difference?
Because you're a trier, that's why.
You've always been a trier.
Oh, I tried.
And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators.
Not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil.
Right on time.
Is that Gideon Grey?
Yep.
It sure is.
We work with him now.
He's our partner.
And we would never have considered it had you not opened our minds.
That's right.
Gid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.
That's really cool, you guys.
Gideon Grey.
I'll be darned.
Hey, Judy.
I'd just like to say I'm sorry for the way I behaved in my youth.
I had a lot of self-doubt, and it manifested itself in the form of unchecked rage and aggression.
I was a major jerk.
I know a thing or two about being a jerk.
Anyhow, I brought y'all these pies.
Hey, kids, don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias.
Well, now, there's a $4 word, Mr.
H.
My family always just called them Night Howlers.
What did you say?
Gid's talking about those flowers, Judy.
I use them to keep the bugs off the produce... but I don't like the little ones going near 'em... on account of what happened to your uncle Terry.
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids and went completely nuts.
He bit the dickens out of your mother.
A bunny can go savage.
Savage?
Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.
Sure it did!
There's a sizable divot in your arm.
I'd call that savage.
Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're flowers!
The flowers are making the predators go savage!
That's it!
That's what I've been missing!
Keys!
Keys, keys, keys!
Hurry!
Come on!
Thank you!
I love you!
Bye!
You catch any of that, Bon?
Not one bit.
That makes me feel a little bit better.
I thought she was talking in tongues.
Who is it?
I need to find Nick.
Please.
Nick?
Nick!
Oh, Nick.
Night Howlers aren't wolves.
They're toxic flowers.
I think someone is targeting predators on purpose and making them go savage!
Wow.
Isn't that interesting?
Wait!
I know you'll never forgive me!
And I don't blame you.
I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant...
And irresponsible and small-minded.
But predators shouldn't have to suffer for my mistakes.
I have to fix this.
But I can't do it without you.
And after we're done... you can hate me.
And that'll be fine.
Because I was a horrible friend... and I hurt you. and you can walk away knowing that you were right all along.
I really am just a dumb bunny.
I really am just a dumb bunny.
I really am just a dumb bunny.
Don't worry, Carrots.
I'll let you erase it... in 48 hours.
All right.
Get in here.
Okay.
You bunnies are so emotional.
There we go.
Deep breath.
Are you just trying to steal the pen?
Is that what this is?
You are standing on my tail, though.
Off, off, off.
I'm sorry.
I thought you guys only grew carrots.
What's the plan?
We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.
Okay.
How?
Know this guy?
I told you.
I know everybody.
Step right up.
Anything you need, I got it.
All your favorite movies!
I got movies that haven't even been released yet.
Hey, 15% off! 20!
Make me an offer!
Come on!
Well, well, look who it is.
The duke of bootleg.
What's it to you, Wilde?
Shouldn't you be melting down a popsicle or something?
Hey, if it ain't Flopsy the Copsy.
We both know those weren't moldy onions I caught you stealing.
What were you gonna do with those Night Howlers, Wezzleton?
It's Weaselton!
Duke Weaselton!
And I ain't talking, rabbit.
And there ain't nothing you can do to make me.
Ice him.
You dirty rat!
Why are you helping her?
She's a cop!
And the godmother to my future granddaughter.
I'm gonna name her Judy.
Ice this weasel.
All right, all right, please!
I'll talk!
I'll talk.
I stole them Night Howlers so I could sell 'em.
They offered me what I couldn't refuse.
Money.
And to whom did you sell them?
A ram named Doug.
We got a drop spot underground.
Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly.
He's unfriendly.
Come on.
The weasel wasn't lying.
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered the market on Night Howlers.
You got Doug here.
What's the mark?
Cheetah in Sahara Square.
Got it.
Serious?
Yeah, I know they're fast.
I can hit him.
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter through the open window of a moving car.
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news.
You know, whichever comes first.
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.
Woolter and Jesse are back, so I'm leaving now.
Out.
Where are you going?
Get back here!
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!
What are you looking at?
Hey!
Whatever you're thinking, stop thinking it.
Carrots!
Carrots!
It better have the extra foam this time.
Hey, open up!
What are you doing?
You just trapped us in here.
We need to get this evidence to the ZPD!
Great!
Here it is.
Got it!
No.
All of it!
Wait, what?
Great, you're a conductor now?
It would take a miracle to get this rust-bucket going.
Well.
Hallelujah.
We kinda got a situation at the lab.
It just got worse!
Mission accomplished.
Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot-toot?
All right.
One toot-toot.
Well, I can cross that off the bucket list.
I may have to rescind that victory toot-toot.
Maybe that's just hail.
Come here!
Back off!
Incoming!
Carrots!
Don't stop!
Keep going!
No, no!
Please stop!
Do not stop this car!
Speed up, Nick!
Speed up!
There's another train coming!
Trust me.
Speed up!
Stop the train!
Hey!
Need some help?
Oh, no, no, no!
Too fast!
Hold on!
I think this is our stop!
Maybe some of the evidence survived.
Everything is gone.
We've lost it all.
Yeah... except for this.
Nick!
Yes!
Come on!
We gotta get to the ZPD.
Cut through the Natural History Museum!
There it is!
Judy!
Judy!
Mayor Bellwether!
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting predators with a serum.
That's what's making them go savage.
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job!
Thank you, ma'am.
How did you know where to find us?
I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.
You know what?
I think Nick and I will just take this to the ZPD.
Run.
Get them.
Carrots!
I got you!
Come here, come here.
Okay, now just relax.
Blueberry?
Pass.
Come on out, Judy.
Take the case.
Get it to Bogo.
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
That's not happening.
I can't walk.
We'll think of something.
We're on the same team, Judy.
Underestimated, underappreciated.
Aren't you sick of it?
Predators.
They may be strong and loud... but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.
Think of it. 90% of the population... united against a common enemy.
We'll be unstoppable.
Over there!
Help!
Well, you should have just stayed on the carrot farm, huh?
It really is too bad.
I did like you.
What are you going to do?
Kill me?
No, of course not.
He is.
No!
Nick!
Yes, police!
There's a savage fox in the Natural History Museum.
Officer Hopps is down!
Please, hurry.
No.
Nick, don't do this.
Fight it.
But he can't help it, can he?
Since preds are just biologically predisposed to be savages.
Gosh.
Think of the headline! "Hero cop killed by savage fox." So that's it?
Prey fears predator, and you stay in power?
Yeah, pretty much.
It won't work!
Fear always works.
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.
Oh, Nick.
No.
Bye-bye, bunny.
Blood!
Blood!
Blood and death.
All right, you're milking it.
Besides, I think we got it.
We got it up there, thank you, Yakety-yak!
You laid it all out beautifully.
What?
Are you looking for the serum?
Well, it's right here.
What you've got in the weapon there?
Those are blueberries.
From my family's farm.
They are delicious.
You should try some.
I framed Lionheart.
I can frame you, too.
It's my word against yours.
Actually...
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way. ...it's your word against yours.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
Boom.
Former mayor Dawn Bellwether is behind bars today... guilty of masterminding the savage attacks that have plagued Zootopia of late.
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart, denies any knowledge of her plot... claiming he was just trying to protect the city.
Did I falsely imprison those animals?
Well, yes.
Yes, I did.
It was a classic "doing the wrong thing for the right reason" kind of a deal.
In related news, doctors say the Night Howler antidote is proving effective... in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.
Emmitt.
Emmitt.
Thank you.
When I was a kid... ...I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.
Where everyone got along and anyone could be anything.
Turns out, real life's a little bit more complicated... than a slogan on a bumper sticker.
Real life is messy.
We all have limitations.
We all make mistakes.
Which means, hey, glass half-full, we all have a lot in common.
And the more we try to understand one another... the more exceptional each of us will be.
But we have to try.
So, no matter what type of animal you are... from the biggest elephant... to our first fox...
I implore you... try.
Try to make the world a better place.
Look inside yourself... and recognize that change... starts with you.
It starts with me.
It starts with all of us.
All right, enough!
Shut it!
We have some new recruits with us this morning... including our first fox.
Who cares?
You should have your own line of inspirational greeting cards, sir.
Shut your mouth, Wilde.
Assignments.
Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, Delgato...
Tundratown SWAT.
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard... undercover.
Hopps, Wilde.
Parking duty.
Dismissed.
Just kidding!
We have reports of a street racer tearing up Savannah Central.
Find him, shut him down.
So, are all rabbits bad drivers, or is it just you?
Oops.
Sorry.
Sly bunny.
Dumb fox.
You know you love me.
Do I know that?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour.
I hope you have a good explanation.
Flash?
Flash?
Hundred yard dash?
Nick.
Good evening, Zootopia!
Come on, everybody, put your paws up!
I messed up tonight I lost another fight Lost to myself But I'll just start again I keep falling down I keep on hitting the ground But I always get up now To see what's next I won't give up No, I won't give in Till I reach the end And then I'll start again No, I won't leave I want to try everything I want to try even though I could fail I won't give up No, I won't give in Till I reach the end Then I'll start again No, I won't leave I want to try everything I want to try even though I could fail Try everything Try everything Try everything Put your paws in the air.
Come on!
Look how far you've come You filled your heart with love Baby, you've done enough Take a deep breath Don't beat yourself up No need to run so fast Sometimes we come last But we did our best I won't give up No, I won't give in Till I reach the end And then I'll start again No, I won't leave I want to try everything I want to try Even though I could fail I won't give up No, I won't give in Till I reach the end Then I'll start again No, I won't leave I want to try everything I want to try even though I could fail I'll keep making those new mistakes And I'll keep on making them every day Those new mistakes Try everything Try everything Try everything Come on!
Shake your tails with me.
Come on!
Yeah!
I'll keep on making those new mistakes I'll keep on making them every day Those new mistakes Try everything Try everything Try everything Try everything
Pirates!
We're under attack!
Hold them off!
Get down on the floor.
Tear gas!
What are you waiting for?
Break it down!
Where'd she go?
There she is!
She's getting away!
Well, get her!
Mama, don't drop me!
There's the stone.
Quick, go next door!
Get that crystal!
There goes the crystal.
CASTLE IN THE SKY Two meatballs, please.
Working late?
We're finally busy again.
Still working?
Yeah.
What's that?
A person!
Pazu!
What are you up to?
Where's my dinner?
Boss!
A girl fell from the sky.
Boss, she fell from the sky.
Darn old clunker.
Boss!
A girl...
Close valve number two!
Pazu, toss me a wrench.
Sure.
I'm busy here.
You take it.
Don't make them wait.
Yes!
Keep a steady hand.
Yes!
Brake!
Any luck?
No silver, no tin even.
All that wasted work.
Should we try the east vein?
That's riddled with old holes.
We'll have to start over.
That's enough for today.
Push!
Shut down the boiler.
Call it a day.
I'll go under at this rate.
Oil the clunker, Pazu.
Yes!
Mama, we couldn't find her.
It's too dark.
I hope you really looked!
All right.
We'll wait for daylight.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Hey, come on guys...
I'm Pazu.
I live here by myself.
They eat after I play.
So you are human after all.
I was afraid you were an angel.
Thanks for helping me.
I'm Sheeta.
Sheeta, nice name.
You fell from the sky.
A bit scary.
That's right.
Why am I still alive?
I fell from the airship...
Have you forgotten?
Yes.
Say, can I see that?
This?
Yes.
It's been in my family forever.
It's beautiful.
Wait...
Watch this!
Pazu!
So it wasn't the stone after all.
Pazu!
Oh, no!
Pazu!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you?
I'm fine.
Sorry, did it hurt?
No, my head's harder than my boss's fists.
The pot's still boiling.
Hungry?
Let's eat.
Wash up over there.
There's a towel.
Thank you.
Laputa...
Sheeta!
Where are you?
My father took that picture.
That's Laputa, an island in the sky.
An island in the sky?
They say it's only a myth.
But my father saw it.
He took it from an airship.
There's a Laputa in Gulliver's Travels, but Swift made it up.
Dad drew this.
He said the abandoned palace was full of treasure.
But nobody believed him.
Until he died, they called him a liar.
But my father never lied.
I'm building a real plane.
I'm going to find Laputa!
A real automobile...
They're pirates!
They attacked the airship.
Are they after you?
Yes.
Quick!
Morning!
Hey, wait!
We're in a rush.
Have you seen a girl?
Sure, yesterday...
The boss's kid, Madge...
Off you go!
They're looking for you.
Louis, a girl's dress!
What!
She was disguised!
Tell Mama!
All right!
Haven't seen her.
A cute little girl.
Brown hair, braids...
Boss!
Boss!
About that age.
Hey!
That's her!
Pirates!
They're chasing her.
Pirates!
Lemme see!
Not one step closer.
Hand her over.
Pirates, eh?
Dola's clan.
Go home.
Just poor folk here.
Ma'am?
Scoot out the back.
I want to fight.
They've got weapons!
But...
What a pretty girl.
Better protect her.
You refuse to step aside?
Use your fists.
Could be interesting.
Get him, brother.
Show your stuff.
Wow.
Who's going to mend that shirt?
You can beat him!
That's it, hit him!
Off you go!
Think you can fool me?
After them!
Climb on!
There you go.
Playing hooky for a date?
Bad guys are after us.
The Dola clan.
Pirates?
Take us to the next town.
To the police!
You're on.
Stoke the fire.
Okay.
Mama!
You idiots!
Hurry up and get on!
What?
But the girl's...
She slipped out the back door.
Get moving!
Brother!
Wait!
They're catching up, more steam!
Can't you go any faster?
She's an old-timer.
Move over!
Whoa!
Mama, I can't hang on!
More steam, they're gaining on us!
Here we go!
Sheeta, over here.
Stoke the fire.
Okay!
Don't give up!
Push!
Push, I tell you!
Not so fast!
Don't let them escape!
Dump this over the side!
That'll teach them!
I'll do it.
No, let me.
Up we go!
Up we go!
Wait!
It's them.
What'll we do?
I refuse to give up.
Move!
This is a surprise.
If it isn't the army!
These kids need help!
They've got pirates after them.
Sheeta?
Goodbye.
Wait!
Sheeta!
Halt or I'll shoot.
An armored train.
Who cares!
Ram it!
What is it, Sheeta!
Stay away!
They're gonna fall!
Quiet.
Watch closely.
We're floating!
Look!
It's that crystal!
It was the stone after all!
Amazing!
We'll float all the way down.
Amazing!
I want it!
Fire!
I have to get that amazing stone!
It's fading...
Hey, wait!
It's just like when you landed.
The opening looks so tiny.
I hope the boss and the engineer aren't in any trouble.
Aw, don't worry.
Miners aren't exactly wimps.
Come on, let's find the way out.
These mines are ancient.
Tunnels everywhere.
There.
I'm so happy.
I was starving.
I've still got an apple and some candy.
It's like you have a magical bag that holds everything.
Gondoa?
That's so far north.
Yes.
Both my parents died, but they left me the house and the fields, so I was getting by on my own.
Those guys with dark glasses kidnapped you?
Yes.
That guy was one of them?
Who can they be, calling in the army?
Dola and the other guys, they all want the stone.
But I had no idea it had mysterious powers.
It was always in our family.
Mother left it to me when she died.
She warned me never to show it or give it to anyone.
We're both orphans, aren't we?
I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this.
When you fell from the sky my heart was racing.
I knew something wonderful had begun.
Little demons...
Little demons.
Uncle Pom!
He's really great.
Uncle Pom.
We've lost our way.
Now that little demon sure looks like Pazu...
With a little girl demon beside him.
Pirates are after us.
And the army.
How very extraordinary.
Drink up.
Thank you.
Have you always lived underground?
Why, no, no.
The rocks have been stirring...
That's when I like to be down here.
The rocks were stirring?
Rocks speak very softly.
Wonderful...
Pazu, look at that!
They were ordinary rocks until...
How pretty...
Here, let me show you.
It's gone.
These rocks contain volucite.
Volucite?
As soon as it's exposed to the air, it becomes ordinary stone.
It's glowing...
Oh, my gracious!
That's a volucite crystal, my dear.
I've never seen one before.
That's why the rocks were stirring.
This stone has mysterious powers.
I thought only Laputans knew how to make volucite crystals.
Laputans?
They used Volucite to send a magnificent island aloft...
Laputa did exist, Sheeta!
It really did!
Does the island still exist?
Uncle Pom?
Dear, would you mind covering the stone?
Its power overwhelms me.
Yes.
What's wrong?
My grandfather told me... the rocks stir when Laputa floats overhead.
If you went up to the sky then, you'd find Laputa!
Sheeta, my father was telling the truth!
Young lady...
You see...
Yes?
Your stone is most powerful...
I know that.
I've been speaking to rocks all my life.
A stone so powerful brings happiness, but it also often brings misery.
I see.
What's more, your stone is the work of men.
How on earth did you...
The stone's not dangerous!
It already saved Sheeta twice!
Amazing!
Laputa really does exist!
It's gone.
Let's go back to the ship.
When it's this quiet, it's best to stay put.
I'm hungry...
It's all clear.
Let's go.
Thank you, Uncle.
Look after yourselves.
Look at those clouds!
Beyond those clouds is an island we've only dreamed of.
Here I come!
I know I'm going to find Laputa!
Pazu...
I haven't told you everything.
My family had a mysterious, ancient name... that came with this stone.
My name is Lucita, Lucita Toelle Ur....
Laputa.
Laputa?
So you mean...
It's the army!
Run!
Underground!
Don't move!
How dare you!
Pazu!
Let me go!
Pazu!
Pazu!
We've apprehended them.
Good work.
Open up, open up!
Sheeta...
Company, march!
Use force!
Squeeze the brat, she'll talk.
Spoken like a man in uniform.
In your haste, you risk everything.
If we'd mobilized sooner, we'd have bagged Dola too.
She managed to decipher your third-rate code.
What!
My organization will handle this.
Concentrate on mobilizing the troops when the time is ripe.
Muska!
Remember, I command the search for Laputa!
Of course.
But I have my orders from the government.
That pencil-pushing upstart!
Have a nice rest?
Where's Pazu?
Let me see him!
No interest in pretty clothes?
Don't fret about Pazu.
His stubborn head is harder than mine.
Come, I have something to show you.
Enter.
What is it?
A mechanical soldier with vast destructive power.
Until he fell from the sky, no one believed Laputa was real.
He's not of this earth.
Our science can't even identify... what material he's made of.
Look...
Don't be afraid.
He's long dead.
Look at that.
This insignia was carved on your fireplace.
It's on this stone, too.
The stone works only in your hands.
It protects its owner and will guide her back to Laputa.
I know nothing of this!
Take it if you like.
Just leave us alone...
Perhaps you imagine that Laputa is some kind of treasure island.
Fearsome scientific power thrust Laputa into orbit.
Their dreaded empire once ruled the earth!
Even you can appreciate that when such an entity roams the skies, it threatens peace.
I need your cooperation.
You must know how to make the stone guide us to Laputa.
I really don't know!
Please let me see Pazu!
I intend no harm, but his fate rests with you.
What?
The boy goes free if you assist us, Lucita...
Toelle Ur Laputa.
But how...
Ur means ruler.
Toelle means True.
You are Princess Lucita, rightful heir to the Laputan throne.
Out!
Sheeta!
Pazu, are you hurt?
I'm fine.
You?
Did they do anything horrible?
My dear Pazu, we misjudged you.
Accept our apologies.
We didn't know how gallantly... you protected her from the pirates.
Sheeta, what did you...
Pazu, I beg you, forget about Laputa.
What!
Sheeta will aid us in our search for Laputa.
I understand how you feel, but forget about her.
Is this true, Sheeta?
But we...
Thank you for everything.
I'll never forget you, Pazu.
I don't believe it...
Sheeta, we promised!
Farewell!
Sheeta!
Wait, Sheeta!
Be reasonable.
Act like a man.
Sheeta!
Here's a token of our gratitude.
It's yours.
Only you can recall the words that will waken this stone.
If you keep your promise, you too shall be free.
Pazu...
Mama, it's Pazu!
He's back!
Pazu.
We were so worried.
You just disappeared.
And the girl?
Forget it.
Pazu!
Let me go!
What are you doing?
Put a lid on it!
Nice place you got, kid.
Get out!
This is my house!
Oh, come off it.
Can't even protect a little girl...
What do you say?
He's got gold!
Sold her for money, huh?
No!
I wouldn't do that!
You let them pay you off?
Sheeta told me to do it.
So...
So you gave in and crawled home.
You call yourself a man?
You talk big, but you're after Sheeta too.
But of course, we're pirates.
Pirates hunt for treasure.
Those guys are strange ones.
What's the girl to them?
You think she'll get out alive?
So, Sheeta told you to leave?
They threatened her, so she tried to save you.
How do you know, Mama?
I've been a woman for 50 years.
She steels her heart to save her man.
How touching.
Reminds me of my youth.
If you boys want to get married, look for one like her.
So that girl will grow up...
To be like Mama?
What a waste.
I've got all your codes.
Calling the battle cruiser?
They'll pack her up and take off?
We better hurry!
Dinner's over.
Move out.
Yes, Mama.
Going after Sheeta?
We want the crystal, not the girl.
The stone's no good without her.
Can't I go with you?
I have to help Sheeta!
Do it on your own, like a man.
You're right, if I was clever and strong, I could've defended her.
Please, I don't care about treasure.
Listen to him...
Shut up!
Yes!
He could probably help us with her...
You'll be an outcast forever.
I know.
You sure?
Yup!
Be ready in 40 seconds.
Take care, you guys.
Tie this to your belt.
You boys wait on the ship.
A magnificent vessel.
Has the girl talked?
I need a little more time.
Forget it!
We'll squeeze it out of her up there.
We depart at dawn, with the girl.
Step on it, it's almost dawn!
Sheeta!
Whatever shall we do?
Sheeta, listen, I'm going to teach you... a magic spell for trouble.
A magic spell?
Yes.
These are old, old, old secret words.
They mean "help me rekindle the light." Perfect.
Just as the ancient books described.
This is the sacred light.
Sacred light?
What are the magic words?
Tell me.
Let's go.
Yeah.
It's moving!
The robot, it's alive!
Hello!
Help!
It's alive!
It's the robot!
The robot?
It's coming this way.
Run!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Incredible!
I see!
It's the light!
The sacred light broke his seal!
The way to Laputa is open!
Come!
No!
It can fly!
It's pointing to the sky...
It's showing the way to Laputa.
Hurry!
Explosives?
Idiot!
You'll blow up the fortress!
Hello, hello!
What is this!
Good.
We're connected.
This is Colonel Muska.
The robot cut communication with the ship.
I've assumed emergency command.
It's after the girl on the tower.
Take it down on sight.
Prepare to fire.
Hurry!
Hurry up!
Fire!
Hurry!
We did it.
Amazing!
Get the girl.
Is she dead?
Get up!
She just fainted.
Stand!
It moved...
What's that?
Looks like a war.
Let's go, Dola!
That's Captain, to you!
Lower, Charles.
Stop!
Stop it!
Please!
Mama, Goliath's pushing off!
We're going directly into the crossfire.
Regroup!
Look, there's Sheeta!
Where?
Where?
Straight ahead.
She's on top of that tower!
This is a job for a woman!
Cover me.
Sheeta!
I'm coming, Sheeta!
Pazu!
Fly closer!
Pazu!
Let me go!
Sheeta!
Dola!
Pazu!
Pazu!
Pull up!
Last chance!
Grab her on the fly!
Pazu!
Here goes!
All right!
Move aside!
Damn!
Sheeta!
What's Goliath doing?
A smoke screen?
Where's the robot?
Destroyed.
The girl went that way.
What!
Put out the fire!
Organize a search party!
We haven't lost the sacred stone.
Its light points to Laputa...
Inform the general, we'll depart for Laputa as planned.
Lucky guy...
I can't believe she'll grow up to be just like Mama...
There's your valley...
Right back where we started.
Dola, please take us aboard.
Call me Captain!
What use are you without the crystal?
We'll work.
I want to see Laputa for myself.
Don't want any treasure?
You just want to see Laputa?
Suspect motives for boarding a pirate ship.
Are they coming with us, Mama?
One false move and you're shark bait!
Excellent!
No more laundry or cleaning duty!
Or dish washing!
Or potato peeling!
Can you make pudding?
Yes...
I like mincemeat pie.
I eat, uhm... anything!
Enough out of you!
When will those boys ever grow up?
Get off!
Canvas.
It's made of cloth.
And don't tear it.
Hurry up, it's crowded in here!
Hurry, this way!
I hate dawdlers.
You're with me!
Pazu!
I don't bite.
Come.
You're not here for fun.
What an engine.
Now where'd he go?
Pops!
Pops!
Look, we got you an assistant.
Don't holler.
I hear you.
He's tougher than Mama.
Be careful.
My hand doesn't fit.
This gasket?
Name?
Pazu.
The crystal pointed nearly due east...
You sure about that?
I could see the sunrise from the tower.
It's the harvest season now... so the sun rises just south of due east.
The light pointed to the left of where the sun rose.
Good answer.
Any luck?
Not a peep.
They're maintaining radio silence, aren't they?
Mama, Goliath's faster.
What do we do?
We're upwind of them.
If we get a lift on the trade winds...
My abacus from the Far East.
Windspeed is 10... and...
I think we can catch up.
Okay, listen up!
Goliath's on its way to Laputa.
We're on their tail.
With these winds, I expect contact tomorrow.
Ten gold pieces to whoever spots her first!
Ten!
Whatever we find, I'm sure Laputa has riches enough for any pirate gang!
Earn your keep, boys!
Now!
Course 98, speed 40.
That getup of yours won't work.
Wear these.
Your station.
Beautiful...
You serve five meals a day.
Go easy on the water.
Get to work, you idiots!
Yes?
I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet.
I've never cooked on an airship...
Do you need something?
Beautiful...
What?
I thought I'd give you a hand in my spare time.
Why thank you.
Can you put those dishes away?
Happy to obli...
You said your stomach hurt...
I've got some free time.
Can I...
You're in the way.
Some stomachache, jerk!
Hey, can I help...
You've changed, chasing the likes of Goliath...
But it's pointless.
It's Laputan treasure I'm after.
They're certainly nice kids...
Get to the point, you old goat.
They're too upright and honest to ever respect you.
What's that!
No, I mean...
Check...
Excellent... delicious...
Seconds anyone?
Okay.
More!
More!
More!
Hey, shake a leg.
It's your watch.
Take it, it's cold.
Watch?
Yeah.
Darn cold!
Go on up.
My turn.
Great.
Sheeta!
That was scary!
The sky is beautiful.
Sheeta.
Get in.
Can't you sleep?
Nice and warm...
Look aft.
Pazu?
What?
I'm really scared.
I really don't want to go to Laputa.
I hope we never find Goliath. - You mean-- - No, the light pointed the right way.
But...
You mean the robot?
Poor thing.
I never dreamed that little spell would work.
I learned lots of other spells.
To help find things, cure the sick.
And one I must never, ever use.
Never, ever use?
A spell of destruction.
I had to learn bad ones so the good spells had power.
I was so scared, I couldn't sleep.
That stone should be locked away.
They hid it in the fireplace.
It was only worn for weddings.
My mother's and grandmother's and great-grandmother's.
I should have thrown it away.
You're wrong.
We met thanks to the stone.
Throwing it away won't make Laputa disappear.
Airships are improving.
Someone will find it.
I don't know what to do, but if Laputa is so dangerous... it's not for the likes of Muska.
Besides...
If we run now, they'll hunt us forever.
But don't become a pirate for me.
I won't become a pirate.
Dola understands.
She's nicer than she looks.
Once things are settled, I'll take you to Gondoa.
I want to see where you were born, the valley, the yaks...
Pazu...
What's that!
Below us, look!
Goliath, right below us!
Come about!
Full rudder!
We should go after them.
They'll be trouble if we don't!
We can't catch them in these clouds.
We'll get them.
They won't go far.
Steady as she goes.
We're farther north than I thought.
Pazu, listen up!
Time's running out.
If we lose Goliath, it's all over.
Your eyes are sharp.
Track them from the crow's nest.
What do I do?
That lookout post is a glider.
See the crank?
Yeah. - Turn it clockwise.
Once it's locked, the upper lever unfolds the wings.
Use the wire to stabilize them.
Figure out how to steer as you go!
Sheeta, you there?
Yes.
Get back down here. - Why?
Because you're a girl!
But so are you!
Besides, I'm a mountain girl with sharp eyes.
Sheeta!
Please.
Pazu agrees.
Once you're aloft, the voice tube won't work.
See the head set?
You mean this, right?
Wow...
Okay.
I'll give it a try.
Release us.
Here goes.
They're gone.
Slipped into the clouds.
Look sharp!
They could be anywhere.
Aye!
Hold on tight.
What's wrong!
We're fine.
Just ran into a gust of wind.
We're keeping watch.
Scared?
No.
I'm getting the hang of it.
Rough skies ahead.
Sheeta, get the rope from my bag.
Okay.
Tie yourself to me.
Okay.
The mercury's dropping, Mama...
Lousy luck.
Storm coming up...
How long 'til dawn?
One more hour.
It's dawn.
Strange that the sun's rising on that side...
I know!
We're supposed to be heading east.
Bridge!
What!
We're heading north?
The compass is pointing east.
The shifting winds must have put us off course. - Look!
What is it?
Goliath?
It's a cloud.
A huge one...
A cloud?
It's headed for us!
A castle in the sky...
We're headed into a low pressure system.
Turn her away, full speed!
It's sucking us in.
Hold tight, we can't help!
The helm won't move!
Where's your brute strength?
Engine's burning up!
Stop whining and figure something out!
We're clearing the clouds!
Sheeta, the ocean!
The Dragon's Lair!
So this is the Dragon's Lair...
Just as Dad said.
The wind's blowing the other way.
Look out, a wall of wind!
Mama!
It's sucking us in!
Don't give up!
Be a man!
Bridge!
It's Laputa!
What was that?
Dad saw Laputa inside the Dragon's Lair.
Don't be ridiculous!
It'll tear you to pieces!
Pazu!
Look.
Just what we need.
Let's go for it!
Dad did it.
He made it back.
All right, into the Dragon's Lair!
Got 'em!
Our ship's in danger.
We must withdraw.
Stay on course.
What?
The light's pointing right into the cloud.
Laputa's in there.
Stay on course.
We'll find a way in.
Here we go, Sheeta!
Okay.
Sheeta, Sheeta!
Are you all right?
Look...
Laputa...
I'm sorry.
Wait...
I tied it really tight.
My hands are shaking...
We did it!
Birds...
Where is everyone?
Coming to greet you?
But I don't have the stone.
I'll cut the rope.
What are you doing!
Wait.
Please don't break that.
We need it to get home.
A flycatcher's nest!
That's why he's here?
See?
All your eggs are fine.
The birds aren't afraid.
It says to follow.
You understand it?
Just intuition.
It's a city...
What an amazing place...
You can see the sky!
If their science was so advanced, what happened?
It's a grave.
I wish I could read the writing.
Someone left flowers.
Do you leave the flowers?
Pazu!
It's a different robot!
It must've broken down long ago...
Probably a gardener robot.
It protected this place even after the people went away.
You picked flowers for the grave.
Thank you.
Are you all alone?
Are there any other robots here?
He doesn't seem to be lonely.
He's got friends and birds' nests to look after...
This way!
This section's been destroyed.
They got the Tiger Moth.
I hope the pirates are okay.
Sheeta, look there!
They're prisoners!
They hang pirates.
We must help them.
Let's go!
We found a way in.
Look at this, mountains of treasure.
W...
What?
Wow...
Want some?
I'll give you plenty of rope.
Have you reported that we found Laputa?
Just about to.
Make the code good and complicated.
Hey!
No looting!
The perfect distraction for those idiots.
What amazing roots.
You can climb trees, can't you?
I see a way.
No better than thieves.
If they reach the garden...!
Sheeta, let's find the stone!
It's the only way to stop them.
I was wondering why the clouds parted.
It was so they could land.
Was it my spell?
Muska was right.
The seal's broken.
The kingdom's waking up.
It's welcomed the visitor with the stone.
But Muska will become king.
He's got much worse in mind.
But what do I do when I get the stone back...
Wait, that spell!
You mean... the destruction spell?
Down and around.
I'll go first.
Okay.
It's here somewhere.
Please, God...
This is it!
It's that kid.
No!
Don't shoot!
Capture her.
Well, if it isn't the little princess.
Sheeta!
Damn!
What is it, Colonel?
The last of the pirates.
There's one right under you.
Yes sir!
Sheeta, wait for me!
Pazu!
Grenades!
Is that Pazu?
What was that?
No, it wasn't.
What's wrong?
Over here!
The general is over there.
Militia, fall in on the double.
Dola!
They've got Sheeta.
I'm going after her.
I'll cut your ropes.
Get out of here.
Hey, wait!
Take this.
Thanks.
The boy has become a man.
What!
Muska destroyed all the radio equipment?
Yes, while the ship was lightly guarded.
Several guards are badly wounded.
The colonel entered the inner palace with the girl.
The soldiers saw him.
That upstart's finally showing his colors.
Hunt him down and arrest him!
All units!
Hey!
Hurry!
Shoot if he resists!
Find the entrance.
Where are we, Colonel?
Laputa's core.
The castle above is just a trifle.
All of Laputa's knowledge is crystallized here.
You two wait here.
Colonel!
Only royalty may enter the sacred area.
What is this!
The roots have invaded...
Eventually, we'll burn them all.
Come, this way.
Darn it...
Yes...
This is it!
Here, too!
Screw it...
Found it!
Behold the giant crystal!
Source of Laputa's power.
Fantastic.
It has awaited the king's return for 700 years. 700 years?
Your family forgot even that?
The black rock!
As the epics described!
I can read it.
I know what it says!
Just who are you?
I too have an ancient, secret name, Lucita.
My name is Romuska Palo Ur Laputa.
We are descended from the same royal family.
Later it split into two branches.
Not even a crack.
It's indestructible.
Deploy all our explosives.
Force won't be necessary, Your Excellency.
Muska, where are you!
What are you waiting for, General?
All right, after me!
Forward!
What is this!
Muska, where are you?
Silence!
What on earth!
Watch your tongue.
You're in the presence of Laputa's king.
Are you insane?
Let's celebrate Laputa's return with a demonstration of its power.
Sheeta!
Behold Laputa's thunder!
Sheeta.
It's the heavenly fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
It's the Ramayana's Arrow of Indra.
The world shall bow down before Laputa once more!
Wonderful, Muska.
You're a hero.
A monumental achievement.
What?
I grow tired of your stupid face.
Run, everyone!
Die!
It's those monsters!
Look at them...
Run!
Are the Flaptors okay?
Ready to fly!
Let's hurry!
Quiet.
Keep your voice down.
What are those two doing?
I'll have to leave them behind.
I advise you not to anger me.
We'll be alone here for a long time.
They should've escaped.
You think you can fight me?
Robots!
Sheeta!
Fantastic!
A marvelous display, no?
Die, you insects!
How dare you!
Damn.
Be a good girl, give it back.
Please, open!
Just where will you go?
Open!
Sheeta!
Sheeta!
Pazu!
Sheeta!
Pazu!
Sheeta!
Sheeta!
Pazu!
Sheeta!
I'm coming.
Damn.
Get back!
Take this, hurry!
Muska's coming, quick!
Throw it into the sea.
Sheeta!
Hold onto that stone.
I'll trade her life for it.
Get up!
No more hide and seek.
How delightful that it should end in the throne room.
Come here!
The throne room?
This will be our grave.
What is a king when his country lies ruined?
I won't give you the stone.
You'll die, trapped here with me.
There's no escape.
This is why Laputa died out.
There's a song in my valley...
Put down your roots in the soil Live together with the wind Pass the winter with the seeds Sing in the spring with the birds Your weapons may be powerful.
Your pitiful robots may be numerous.
But you can't survive away from the earth.
Laputa will not die.
It will rise again.
Its power is the stuff of humanity's dreams.
Next, I shoot off your ears!
Beg for your life.
Make the kid hand over the stone.
Wait!
The stone's hidden.
You can shoot, but you won't get it.
Stay away, Pazu.
He'll kill us both.
I'll spare her life if you tell me where the stone is.
Or do you intend to conquer me with that cannon of yours?
Let me talk to Sheeta alone.
Run away.
Take the stone and run!
Three minutes.
Pazu.
Sheeta, calm down and listen.
Teach me that spell.
I'll say it with you.
Put your hand in mine.
I cut the pirates' ropes.
Time's up.
What do you say?
My eyes!
My eyes!
I can't see...
Mama, it's collapsing!
All right, let's go.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Look, the bottom's falling out!
Sheeta was such a nice girl...
They used the spell of destruction.
Those kids saved Laputa from those idiots.
It's stopping!
A crystal!
A humongous one!
It's rising.
The tree... it's carrying it away.
Chase it!
You're heavy, get off.
I can't!
Sheeta!
Pazu...
The roots protected us.
We can still use this.
Here goes.
What are you doing, we're not moving.
Of course not, we're overloaded.
It's Sheeta!
She's alive!
It's the kid!
Dola!
Thank God you're alive!
You guys okay?
Oh, no!
My galleon's wrecked...
Oh, stop blubbering.
We'll build a better ship!
You poor child, the worst is having your hair hacked off...
I can't breathe!
Sorry.
Pathetic.
All that work, and only this to show.
We ran out of time!
Long ago, in the faraway land of ancient Greece, there was a golden age of powerful gods and extraordinary heroes.
And the greatest and strongest of all these heroes was the mighty Hercules.
But what is the measure of a true hero?
That is what our story is...
Will you listen to him?
He's makin' the story sound like some Greek tragedy.
Lighten up, dude.
We'll take it from here, darling.
You go, girl.
We are the Muses, goddesses of the arts and proclaimers of heroes.
Heroes like Hercules.
Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules." I'd like to make some sweet music with him...
Our story actually begins long before Hercules, many aeons ago.
Back when the world was new The planet Earth was down on its luck And everywhere gigantic brutes called Titans ran amok It was a nasty place There was a mess wherever you stepped Where chaos reigned and the earthquakes and volcanoes never slept Say it, girlfriend!
And then along came Zeus He hurled his thunderbolt He zapped Locked those suckers in a vault They're trapped And on his own stopped chaos in its tracks And that's the gospel truth The guy was too "Type A" to just relax And that's the world's first dish Yeah, baby.
Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth Though, honey it may seem impossible That's the gospel truth On Mount Olympus life was neat And smooth as sweet vermouth Although, honey it may seem impossible That's the gospel truth Yeah, yeah Hey, hey, hey Hey, yeah Hercules!
Behave yourself.
Look at this.
Look how cute he is.
He's strong like his dad.
Excuse me!
Hot stuff coming through!
Excuse me.
One side, Ares.
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.
Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus do the arrangement.
Isn't that too nutty?
Fabulous party.
You know, I haven't seen this much love in a room since Narcissus discovered himself.
Dear, keep those away from the baby.
He won't hurt himself.
Let the kid have a little fun.
On behalf of my son, I want to thank you all for your wonderful gifts!
What about our gift, dear?
Well, let's see here.
We'll take...
Yes.
A little cirrus and a touch of nimbostratus and a dash of cumulus.
His name is Pegasus, and he's all yours, son.
Mind his head.
He's so tiny.
My boy.
My little Hercules.
How sentimental.
You know, I haven't been this choked up since I got a hunk of moussaka caught in my throat!
So is this an audience or a mosaic?
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good.
Nice dress.
So, Hades, you finally made it.
How are things in the underworld?
Well, they're just fine.
You know, a little dark, a little gloomy.
And, as always, hey, full of dead people.
What are you gonna do?
There's the little sunspot.
Little snootchie.
And here is a sucker for the little sucker, eh?
Here you go.
Ya just...
Powerful little tyke.
Come on, Hades.
Don't be such a stiff.
Join the celebration!
Hey.
Love to, babe, but unlike you gods lounging about up here, I regrettably have a full-time gig that you, by the way, so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.
So, can't.
Love to, but can't.
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.
Work yourself to death!
I kill myself!
If only.
If only.
If there's one god you don't want to get steamed up, it's Hades. 'Cause he had an evil plan.
He ran the underworld But thought the dead were dull and uncouth He was as mean as he was ruthless And that's the gospel truth He had a plan to shake things up And that's the gospel truth Pain!
Coming, your most lugubriousness.
Panic!
I'm sorry.
I can handle it!
Pain!
And Panic!
Reporting for duty!
Reporting for duty!
Fine, fine, fine.
Just let me know the instant the Fates arrive.
They're here.
What?
The Fates are here, and you didn't tell me?
We are worms!
Worthless worms!
We are worms!
Worthless worms!
Memo to me, memo to me.
Maim you after my meeting.
Darling, hold that mortal's thread of life good and tight.
Incoming!
Ladies!
I am so sorry that I'm...
Late!
Late!
We knew you would be.
We know everything.
Past.
Present.
And Future.
Indoor plumbing, it's gonna be big.
Great, great.
Anyway, see, ladies, I was at this party, and I lost track of...
We know!
Yeah.
I know you know.
So here's the deal.
Zeus, Mr.
High and Mighty, Mr. "Hey, you, get off of my cloud," now he has...
A bouncing baby brat.
We know!
I know you know.
I know.
I got it.
I got the concept.
So let me just ask.
Is this kid gonna mess up my hostile takeover bid, or what?
What do you think?
No, you don't.
We're not supposed to reveal the future.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
Time out.
Can I...
Can I ask you a question, by the way?
Are you...
Did you cut your hair or something?
You look fabulous.
I mean, you look like a Fate worse than death.
Gross!
It's blinkin'!
Ladies, please.
My fate is in your lovely hands.
Yeah!
All right.
In 18 years precisely, the planets will align ever so nicely.
Verse.
The time to act will be at hand.
Unleash the Titans, your monstrous band.
Good, good.
Then the once-proud Zeus will finally fall, and you, Hades, will rule all!
Yes!
Hades rules!
A word of caution to this tale.
Excuse me?
Should Hercules fight, you will fail.
What?
Okay, fine, fine.
I'm cool.
I'm fine.
Pain?
Panic?
Got a little riddle for ya.
How do you kill a god?
I do not know!
You can't.
They're immortal?
Bingo!
They're immortal.
So, first you got to turn the little sunspot mortal.
What?
What is it?
The baby!
The baby!
Hercules!
No!
Now we did it!
Zeus is gonna use us for target practice!
Just hang onto the kid, Panic.
Hurry!
Let's just kill the kid and get it over with, okay?
Here you go, kid.
A little Grecian formula.
Look at that!
He's changing.
Can we do it now?
No, he has to drink the whole potion.
Every last drop.
Who's there?
Alcmene, over here.
You poor thing.
Don't cry.
Is anybody there?
Now?
Now.
Well, he must have been abandoned.
Amphitryon, for so many years we've prayed to the gods to bless us with a child.
Perhaps they've answered our prayers.
Perhaps they have. "Hercules"?
Help, help, help!
Hades is gonna kill us when he finds out what happened.
You mean, if he finds out.
Of course he's gonna...
If.
If is good.
It was tragic.
Zeus led all the gods on a frantic search.
But by the time they found the baby, it was too late.
Young Herc was mortal now But since he did not drink the last drop He still retained his godlike strength So thank his lucky stars Tell it, girl.
But Zeus and Hera wept Because their son could never come home They'd have to watch their precious baby grow up from afar Though Hades' horrid plan Was hatched before Herc cut his first tooth The boy grew stronger every day And that's the gospel truth The gospel truth Hercules, slow down!
Look out!
Sorry, guys.
Hey, watch where you're goin'.
Sunday driver!
Thanks, son.
When old Penelope twisted her ankle back there, I thought we were done for.
No problem, Pop.
Don't unload just yet.
First, I have to finagle with Phideas.
Okay.
Sorry, Penelope.
Now, Hercules, this time, please just...
I know.
I know.
Stay by the cart.
That's my boy.
Oh, my goodness.
Careful!
Why, thank you.
No problem.
Why, Hercules!
It's you!
Let me help you with that.
No, no, no, no, no.
I got it!
I'm fine.
You just run along.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Absolutely.
Yo!
Give it here!
Hey, you need an extra guy?
Sorry, Herc.
We already got five, and we want to keep it an even number.
Hey, wait a second.
Five isn't an even...
See ya, Herc.
What a geek!
Destructo Boy.
Maybe we should call him "Jerkules." Heads up!
I got it!
No!
Stop!
No.
It's okay.
Hey!
Son!
Hang on, Pop!
Be right back!
Oh, my!
No!
Don't!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Watch out!
Nice catch, Jerkules.
Son...
This is the last straw, Amphitryon!
That boy is a menace!
He's too dangerous to be around normal people!
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.
He just can't control his strength.
I'm warning you.
You keep that freak away from here!
Freak!
Yeah, go away!
Son, you shouldn't let those things they said back there get to you.
But, Pop, they're right.
I am a freak.
I try to fit in.
I really do.
I just can't.
Sometimes I feel like I really don't belong here, like I'm supposed to be someplace else.
Hercules, son...
I know it doesn't make any sense.
I have often dreamed of a far off place Where a great, warm welcome will be waiting for me Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face And a voice keeps sayin' this is where I'm meant to be I will find my way I can go the distance I'll be there someday If I can be strong I know every mile Will be worth my while I would go most anywhere to feel like I Belong Hercules, there's something your mother and I have been meaning to tell ya.
But if you found me, then where did I come from?
Why was I left here?
This was around your neck when we found you.
It's the symbol of the gods.
This is it!
Don't you see?
Maybe they have the answers!
I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...
Ma, Pop, you're the greatest parents anyone could have, but...
I gotta know.
I am on my way I can go the distance I don't care how far Somehow, I'll be strong I know every mile Will be worth my while I would go most anywhere To find where I belong Mighty Zeus, please, hear me and answer my prayer.
I need to know.
Who am I?
Where do I belong?
My boy.
My little Hercules.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold on, kiddo!
What's your hurry?
After all these years, is this the kind of hello you give your father?
Father?
Didn't know you had a famous father, did you?
Surprise!
Look how you've grown.
Why, you've got your mother's beautiful eyes and my strong chin.
I don't understand.
If you're my father, that would make me a...
A god.
A god.
A god!
Hey, you wanted answers, and by thunder, you're old enough now to know the truth.
But why did you leave me on Earth?
Didn't you want me?
Of course we did.
Your mother and I loved you with all our hearts.
Someone stole you from us and turned you mortal, and only gods can live on Mount Olympus.
And you can't do a thing?
I can't, Hercules, but you can.
Really?
What?
I'll do anything.
Hercules, if you can prove yourself a true hero on Earth, your godhood will be restored!
A true hero.
Great!
Exactly how do you become a true hero?
First, you must seek out Philoctetes, the trainer of heroes.
Seek out Philoctetes.
Right.
I'll...
Hold your horses!
Which reminds me.
You probably don't remember Pegasus, but you two go way back, son.
Pegasus!
He's a magnificent horse with the brain of a bird.
I'll find Philoctetes and become a true hero.
That's the spirit!
I won't let you down, Father!
Good luck, son.
I will beat the odds I can go the distance I will face the world Fearless, proud and strong I will please the gods I can go the distance Till I find my hero's welcome right where I Belong You sure this is the right place?
What's the matter, little guy?
You stuck?
Hey, butt out, buddy!
Girls!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back, come back, come back.
They can't keep their hands off me.
Hey!
What's the matter?
You never seen a satyr before?
No.
Can you help us?
We're looking for someone called Philoctetes.
Call me Phil.
Phil!
Boy, am I glad to meet you!
I'm Hercules.
This is Pegasus.
Animals!
Disgusting!
I need your help.
I want to become a hero, a true hero.
Sorry, kid.
Can't help ya.
Wait!
Sorry.
Why not?
Two words, I am retired.
Look, I gotta do this.
Haven't you ever had a dream, something you wanted so bad you'd do anything?
Kid, come inside.
I want to show you something.
Watch it!
That was part of the mast of the Argo.
The Argo?
Yeah.
Who do you think taught Jason how to sail?
Cleopatra?
I trained all those would-be heroes.
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of "yeuseus." And every single one of those bums let me down flatter than a discus.
None of 'em could go the distance.
And then there was Achilles.
Now, there was a guy who had it all, the build, the foot speed.
He could jab, he could take a hit, he could keep on comin'.
But that furshlugginer heel of his!
He barely gets nicked there once and kaboom!
He's history.
Yeah, I had a dream once.
I dreamed I was gonna train the greatest hero there ever was.
So great, the gods would hang a picture of him in the stars all across the sky, and people would say, "That's Phil's boy." That's right.
But dreams are for rookies.
A guy can only take so much disappointment.
But I'm different than those other guys, Phil!
I can go the distance.
Come on.
I'll show you.
Geez!
You don't give up, do ya?
Watch this.
Holy Hera.
You know, maybe if I...
No!
Snap out of it!
I'm too old to get mixed up in this stuff again.
But if I don't become a true hero, I'll never be able to rejoin my father, Zeus.
Hold it!
Zeus is your father, right?
Zeus.
The big guy.
He's your daddy.
Mr.
Lightning Bolts!
Read me a book, would ya, Da-da?
Zeus! "Once upon a time..." It's the truth!
Please!
So you wanna be a hero, kid Well, whoop-de-do I have been around the block before With blockheads just like you Each and every one a disappointment Pain for which there ain't no ointment So much for excuses Though a kid of "Zeus" is Askin' me to jump into the fray My answer is two words Okay.
You mean you'll do it?
You win.
You won't be sorry, Phil.
Oh, gods.
So when do we start?
Can we start now?
I'd given up hope that someone would come along A fella who'd ring the bell for once Not the gong The kind who wins trophies Won't settle for low fees At least semipro fees But, no, I get the greenhorn I've been out to pasture, pal My ambition gone Content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn But you need an advisor A satyr, but wiser A good merchandiser and...
There goes my ulcer I'm down to one last hope and I hope it's you Though, kid, you're not exactly a dream come true I trained enough turkeys Who never came through You're my one last hope So you'll have to do Rule number six.
When rescuing a damsel, always handle with care.
No!
Rule number 95, kid.
Concentrate!
Rule number 96.
Aim!
Demigods have faced the odds And ended up a mockery Don't believe the stories That you read on all the crockery To be a true hero, kid, is a dying art Like paintin' a masterpiece It's a work of heart It takes more than sinew Comes down to what's in you You have to continue to grow Now, that's more like it!
I'm down to one last shot And my last high note Before that blasted underworld gets my goat My dreams are on you, kid Go make 'em come true Climb that uphill slope Keep pushin' that envelope You're my one last hope And, kid, it's up to you Yeah!
Did you see that?
Next stop, Olympus.
All right, just take it easy, champ.
I am ready.
I want to get off this island.
I want to see battles and monsters.
Rescue some damsels.
You know, heroic stuff.
Well...
Come on!
Phil!
Well, okay.
Okay, you want a road test?
Saddle up, kid.
We're going to Thebes!
So what's in Thebes?
A lot of problems.
It's a big, tough town.
Good place to start buildin' a rep.
Sounds like your basic DID, Damsel in Distress.
Not so fast, sweetheart.
I swear, Nessus.
Put me down or I'll...
I like 'em fiery!
Now, remember, kid.
First, analyze the situation.
Don't just barrel in there without thinking.
He's losin' points for this!
You don't know what you're...
Halt!
Step aside, two legs.
Pardon me, my good sir.
I'll have to ask you to release that young...
Keep movin', junior.
Lady.
But you...
Aren't you a damsel in distress?
I'm a damsel, I'm in distress.
I can handle this.
Have a nice day.
Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close to the situation to realize...
What are you doin'?
Get your sword!
Sword.
Right, right.
Rule number 15, a hero is only as good as his weapon!
Hold it!
Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.
Come on, kid!
Concentrate!
Use your head!
All right!
Not bad, kid!
Not exactly what I had in mind, but not bad.
Miss, I'm really sorry.
That was dumb.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Nice work!
Excelente!
Is Wonderboy here for real?
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real.
And by the way, sweet cheeks, I'm real, too.
How was that, Phil?
Rein it in, rookie.
You can get away with mistakes like those in the minor decathlons, but this is the big leagues!
At least I beat him, didn't I?
Next time, don't let your guard down because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!
It's like I keep tellin' ya.
You gotta stay focused, and...
You...
Are you all right, Miss...
Megara.
My friends call me Meg.
At least, they would if I had any friends.
So did they give you a name along with all those rippling pectorals?
I'm...
Are you always this articulate?
Hercules.
My...
My name is Hercules.
Hercules.
I think I prefer Wonderboy.
So, how'd you get mixed up with the...
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.
They think that "No" means "Yes," and "Get lost" means "Take me, I'm yours." Don't worry.
Shorty here can explain it to ya later.
Well, thanks for everything, Herc.
It's been a real slice.
Wait!
Can we give you a ride?
I don't think your pinto likes me very much.
Pegasus?
No.
Don't be silly.
He'd be more than happy to...
I'll be all right.
I'm a big, tough girl.
I tie my own sandals and everything.
Bye-bye, Wonderboy.
Bye.
She's something.
Isn't she, Phil?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's really something.
A real pain in the patella!
Earth to Herc!
Come in, Herc!
Come in, Herc!
We got a job to do, remember?
Thebes is still waitin'.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
How cute.
A couple of rodents looking for a theme park.
Who you callin' a rodent, sister?
I'm a bunny!
And I'm his gopher.
I thought I smelled a rat.
Meg?
Speak of the devil.
Meg, my little flower, my little bird, my little nut, Meg.
What exactly happened here?
I thought you were gonna persuade the river guardian to join my team for the uprising, and here I am, kind of river guardian-less.
I gave it my best shot, but he made me an offer I had to refuse.
Fine.
So, instead of subtracting two years from your sentence, hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?
Give that your best shot.
It wasn't my fault.
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.
Hercules?
Why does that name ring a bell?
I don't know.
Maybe we owe him money?
What was that name again?
Hercules.
He comes on with this big, innocent farm boy routine, but I could see through that in a Peloponnesian minute.
Wait a minute.
Wasn't Hercules the name of that kid we were supposed to...
Oh, my gods!
Oh, my gods!
Run for it!
So you took care of him, huh?
Dead as a door nail.
Weren't those your exact words?
This might be a different Hercules.
Yeah!
I mean, Hercules is a very popular name nowadays!
Remember, like, a few years ago, every other boy was named Jason, and the girls were all named Brittany?
I'm about to rearrange the cosmos, and the one schlemiel who can louse it up is waltzing around in the woods!
Wait.
Wait, big guy.
We can still cut in on his waltzing.
That's right!
And at least we made him mortal.
That's a good thing.
Didn't we?
Fortunately for the three of you, we still have time to correct this rather egregious oversight.
And this time, no foul-ups.
Is that all one town?
One town, a million troubles.
The one and only Thebes.
The Big Olive itself.
If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
Stick with me, kid.
This city is a dangerous place.
Look where you're goin', numbskull!
Hey, I'm walkin' here!
You see what I mean?
I'm tellin' you, wackos.
Pitta bread.
Pitta bread.
Get your pitta bread here.
Hey, Mack.
You wanna buy a sundial?
He's not interested, all right?
Come on, kid.
The end is coming!
Can't you feel it?
Yes, yes.
Thank you for the info.
Yes.
We'll ponder that for a while.
Just stare at the sidewalk.
Come on.
Don't make eye contact.
People here are nuts.
That's because they live in a city of turmoil.
Trust me, kid.
You're gonna be just what the doctor ordered.
It was tragic!
We lost everything in the fire.
Everything except old Snowball here.
Now, were the fires before or after the earthquake?
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.
But before the flood.
Don't even get me started on the crime rate.
Thebes has certainly gone downhill in a hurry.
Tell me about it.
It seems like every time I turn around, there's some new monster wreaking havoc and I...
All we need now is a plague of locusts.
That's it!
I'm movin' to Sparta!
Excuse me.
It seems to me that what you folks need is a hero.
Yeah, and who are you?
I'm Hercules, and I happen to be a hero.
Is that so?
A hero!
Have you ever saved a town before?
No.
Not exactly, but I...
Have you ever reversed a natural disaster?
Well, no.
Listen to this.
He's just another chariot chaser.
This we need.
That's a laugh.
Don't you pea brains get it?
This kid is the genuine article.
Hey, isn't that the goat-man who trained Achilles?
Watch it, pal.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, nice job on those heels!
Ya missed a spot!
I got your heel right here!
I'll wipe that stupid grin off your face!
You...
Hey, Phil!
Phil!
Phil!
Take it easy.
Phil.
What are you, crazy?
Young man, we need a professional hero, not an amateur.
Well, wait.
Stop!
How am I supposed to prove myself a hero if nobody will give me a chance?
You'll get your chance.
You just need some kind of catastrophe or disaster.
Please.
Help!
Please!
There's been a terrible accident!
Meg?
Speakin' of disasters.
Wonderboy!
Hercules!
Thank goodness!
What's wrong?
Outside of town, two little boys.
They were playing in the gorge.
There was this terrible rockslide.
They're trapped!
Kids?
Trapped?
Phil, this is great!
You're really choked up about this, aren't ya?
Come on!
No, I...
You don't...
I have this terrible fear of heights!
I'm right behind ya, kid!
I'm way behind ya, kid.
I got a fur wedgie.
Are you okay?
I'll be fine.
Just get me down before I ruin the upholstery.
Help!
I can't breathe!
Hurry!
Get us out!
We're suffocating!
Somebody call IX-I-I!
Easy, fellas.
You'll be all right.
We can't last much longer!
Get us out before we get crushed!
How you boys doin'?
We're okay now.
Jeepers, mister.
You're really strong.
Well, try to be a little more careful next time, okay, kids?
We sure will.
A stirring performance, boys.
I was really moved. "Jeepers, mister"?
I was going for innocence.
And, hey, two thumbs way, way up for our leading lady.
What a dish.
What a doll.
Get outta there, you big lug, while you still can.
Phil, I did great.
They even applauded, sort of.
I hate to burst your bubble, kid, but that ain't applause.
Phil?
What do you call that thing?
Two words.
Am-scray!
Let's get ready to rumble!
That's it.
Dance around!
Dance around!
Watch the teeth.
Watch the teeth.
Keep going.
Come on.
Come on.
Lead with your left.
Lead with your left!
Your other left!
All right!
All right!
You're bad!
Okay!
See, Phil?
That...
That wasn't so hard.
Kid, kid, kid.
How many horns do ya see?
Six?
Close enough.
Let's get you cleaned up.
Guys, guys, relax.
It's only half-time.
That doesn't sound good.
Definitely not good!
Will you forget the head-slicing thing?
Phil, I don't think we covered this one in basic training!
My favorite part of the game, sudden death.
There goes another one.
Just like Achilles.
Game.
Set.
Match.
Phil, you gotta admit.
That was pretty heroic.
Ya did it, kid!
Ya did it!
You won by a landslide!
Hades mad.
Well, what do ya know?
From that day forward, our boy Hercules could do no wrong.
He was so hot, steam looked cool.
Oh, yeah Bless my soul Herc was on a roll Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll What a pro Herc could stop a show Point him at a monster and you're talkin' SRO He was a no one A zero, zero Now he's a honcho He's a hero Here was a kid with his act down pat Zero to hero in no time flat Zero to hero Just like that When he smiled the girls went wild With oohs and aahs And they slapped his face on every vase On every "vahse" From appearance fees and royalties Our Herc had cash to burn Now nouveau riche and famous He could tell you what's a Grecian urn Say amen, there he goes again Sweet and undefeated And an awesome 10-for-10 Folks lined up just to watch him flex And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs Hercie, he comes he sees, he conquers Honey, the crowds were goin' bonkers He showed the moxie brains and spunk Yeah From zero to hero A major hunk Zero to hero And who'd have thunk?
Who put the glad in gladiator?
Hercules Who's darin' deeds are great theater?
Hercules Isn't he bold?
No one braver Is he sweet?
Our favorite flavor Hercules My man.
Hercules Hercules Hercules Hercules Look at my Hercules Hercules, Hercules Yeah, yeah, yeah Bless my soul, Herc was on a roll Undefeated Riding high And the nicest guy.
Not conceited He was a nothing Zero, zero Now he's a honcho He's our hero He hit the heights at breakneck speed From zero to hero Herc is a hero Now he's a hero Yes, indeed Pull!
Nice shootin', Rex.
I can't believe this guy.
I throw everything I've got at him and it doesn't even...
What are those?
I don't know.
I thought they looked kinda dashing.
I've got 24 hours to get rid of this bozo, or the entire scheme I've been setting up for 18 years goes up in smoke, and you are wearing his merchandise!
Thirsty?
Looks like your game's over.
Wonderboy is hitting every curve you throw at him.
Yeah.
I wonder if maybe I haven't been throwing the right curves at him, Meg, my sweet.
Don't even go there.
See, he's gotta have a weakness because everybody's got a weakness.
I mean, for what?
Pandora, it was the box thing.
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, okay?
We simply need to find out Wonderboy's.
I've done my part.
Get your little imps...
They couldn't handle him as a baby.
I need somebody who can handle him as a man.
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.
That's good because that's what got you into this jam in the first place.
You sold your soul to me to save your boyfriend's life.
And how does this creep thank you?
By running off with some babe.
He hurt you real bad, didn't he, Meg?
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?
Which is exactly why I got a feelin' you're gonna leap at my new offer.
You give me the key to bringing down Wonder Breath, and I give you the thing that you crave most in the entire cosmos, your freedom.
You should have been there, Father.
I mangled the Minotaur, grappled with the Gorgon.
Just like Phil told me.
I analyzed the situation, controlled my strength and kicked.
The crowds went wild!
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're doin' great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.
I'm glad to hear you say that, Father.
I've been waiting for this day a long time.
What day is that, son?
The day I rejoin the gods.
You've done wonderfully.
You really have, my boy.
You're just not there yet.
You haven't proven yourself a true hero.
But, Father, I've beaten every single monster I've come up against.
I'm the most famous person in all of Greece.
I'm an action figure!
I'm afraid being famous isn't the same as being a true hero.
What more can I do?
It's something you have to discover for yourself.
But how can I...
Look inside your heart.
Father, wait!
On your left is Hercules' villa.
Our next stop is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop where you can pick up the great hero's 30-minute workout scroll                 Buns of Bronze.
At 1:00, you got a meeting with King Augeas.
He's got a problem with his stables.
I'd advise you not to wear your new sandals.
Phil?
I told you, don't move!
DGR, the Daughters of the Greek Revolution.
Phil.
At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle from some Amazons.
Phil, what's the point?
That's it!
Keep your toga on, pal.
What d'you mean, "What's the point?" You wanna go to Olympus, don't ya?
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere.
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.
I gave this everything I had.
Listen to me, kid.
I seen 'em all.
And I am tellin' you, and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth, you got somethin' I never seen before.
Really?
I can feel it right down to these stubby bowlegs of mine.
There is nothin' you can't do, kid.
It's him!
Hey, watch it!
Watch it!
Watch...
I touched his elbow!
I got his sweatband!
Phil, help!
Okay.
Escape plan, beta.
Gotcha.
Hey.
Where is he?
There he goes!
On the veranda!
Let's see.
What could be behind curtain number one?
Meg!
It's all right.
The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.
It's great to see you.
I missed you.
So this is what heroes do on their days off.
I'm no hero.
Sure ya are.
Everybody in Greece thinks you're the greatest thing since they put the pocket in pitta.
I know.
It's crazy.
You know, I can't go anywhere without being mobbed.
I mean...
You sound like you could use a break.
Think your nanny goat would go berserk if you played hooky this afternoon?
I don't know.
Phil's got the rest of the day pretty much booked.
Phil, schmill.
Just follow me.
Out the window, round the dumbbells, you lift up the back wall and we're gone.
What a day.
First, that restaurant by the bay, and then that play, that Oedipus thing.
Man!
I thought I had problems.
Stop foolin' around!
Yeah.
Get the goods, sister.
I didn't know that playing hooky could be so much fun.
Yeah.
Neither did I.
Thanks, Meg.
Don't thank me just yet.
Careful.
Sorry.
Weak ankles.
Yeah?
Well, maybe you better sit down for a while.
So, do you have any problems with things like this?
Weak ankles, I mean.
No.
Not really.
No weaknesses whatsoever?
No trick knee?
Ruptured disks?
No.
I'm afraid I'm fit as a fiddle.
Wonderboy, you are perfect.
Thanks.
It looks better that way.
No, it really does.
You know, when I was a kid, I would have given anything to be exactly like everybody else.
You wanted to be petty and dishonest?
Everybody's not like that.
Yes, they are.
You're not like that.
How do you know what I'm like?
All I know is you're the most amazing person with weak ankles I've ever met.
Meg, when I'm with you, I don't feel so alone.
Sometimes it's better to be alone.
What do you mean?
Nobody can hurt you.
Meg?
I would never, ever hurt you.
And I don't wanna hurt you, so let's both do ourselves a favor and stop this before we...
All right!
Break it up!
Break it up!
Party's over!
I been lookin' all over this town!
Calm down, mutton man.
It was all my fault.
You're already on my list, sister, so don't make it worse!
And as for you, ya bum, you're gonna go to the stadium and you're gonna be put through the workout of your life!
Now get on the horse.
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry.
He'll get over it.
Move!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Move!
Hey, watch it, watch it!
Watch it!
Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...
That's it.
Next time, I drive.
What's the matter with me?
You'd think a girl would learn.
If there's a prize for rotten judgment I guess I've already won that No man is worth the aggravation That's ancient history Been there, done that Who d'ya think you're kidding He's the Earth and heaven to you Try to keep it hidden Honey, we can see right through you Oh, no Girl, you can't conceal it We know how you feel and who you're thinkin' of No chance, no way I won't say it, no, no You swoon, you sigh Why deny it?
It's too clichÃ©, I won't say I'm in love I thought my heart had learned its lesson It feels so good when you start out My head is screaming "Get a grip, girl" Unless you're dyin' To cry your heart out You keep on denying Who you are and how you're feelin' Baby, we're not buyin' Hon, we saw you hit the ceilin' Face it like a grown-up When you gonna own up that you Got Got it bad?
No chance, no way I won't say it, no, no Give up, but give in Check the grin, you're in love This scene won't play I won't say I'm in love You're doing flips Read our lips You're in love You're way off base I won't say I'm it She won't say in love Get off my case, I won't say it Girl, don't be proud It's okay, you're in love At least out loud I won't say I'm in Love Hey, what's the buzz, Meg?
What is the weak link in Wonderboy's chain?
Get yourself another girl.
I'm through.
I'm sorry.
Do you mind runnin' that by me again?
I must have had a chunk of brimstone wedged in my ear or something.
Then read my lips!
Forget it.
Meg, Meg, Meg, my sweet, deluded little minion.
Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy, but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?
I own you!
I got another horn here.
You work for me.
That kid's gonna be doin' laps for a month.
If I say, "Sing," you say, "Hey, name that tune." If I say, "I want Wonderboy's head on a platter," you say...
Medium or well-done.
I knew that dame was trouble.
This is gonna break the kid's heart.
I'll work on that.
I'm sorry.
You hear that sound?
That's the sound of your freedom fluttering out the window forever.
I don't care.
I'm not gonna help you hurt him.
I can't believe you're getting so worked up about some guy.
This one is different.
He's honest, and he's sweet...
Please!
He would never do anything to hurt me.
He's a guy!
Besides, O oneness, you can't beat him.
He has no weaknesses.
He's gonna...
I think he does, Meg.
I truly think he does.
Hey, Phil!
What happened to you?
Kid, we gotta talk.
Phil, I just had the greatest day of my life!
I can't stop thinking about Meg.
She's something else.
Kid, I'm tryin' to talk to ya!
Will you come down here and listen?
How can I come down there when I'm feeling so up?
Gotcha!
Very nice!
What I'm tryin' to say is...
That if it wasn't for you, I never would have met her.
I owe ya big time.
Will you just knock it off for a couple of seconds?
Rule number 38.
Come on, Phil.
Keep them up there, huh?
Phil, I got two words for ya, duck!
Listen to me!
She's...
A dream come true?
Not exactly.
More beautiful than Aphrodite?
Aside from that!
The most wonderful...
She's a fraud!
She's been playin' ya for a sap!
Come on.
Stop kiddin' around.
I'm not kiddin' around.
I know you're upset about today, but that's no reason to...
Kid, you're missin' the point.
The point is, I love her.
She don't love you.
You're crazy.
She's nothin' but a two-timin'...
Stop it!
No-good, lyin', schemin'...
Shut up!
Phil.
I...
I'm sorry.
Okay, okay, that's it.
You won't face the truth?
Fine.
Phil, wait.
Where you going?
I'm hoppin' the first barge out of here.
I'm goin' home.
Fine!
Go!
I don't...
I don't need you.
I thought you were gonna be the all-time champ, not the all-time chump.
Geez Louise!
What got his goat, huh?
Name is Hades, Lord of the Dead.
Hi.
How ya doin'?
Not now, okay?
Hey, hey.
I only need a few seconds and I'm a fast talker, all right?
I've got the major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.
And Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?
You seem to be constantly getting in the way of it.
You've got the wrong guy.
Hear me out, ya little...
Just hear me out, okay?
So I would be eternally grateful if you would just take a day off from this hero business of yours.
I mean, monsters, natural disasters.
You wait a day, okay?
You're out of your mind.
Not so fast, because, ya see, I do have a little leverage you might wanna know about.
Meg!
Don't listen, Herc...
Let her go!
Here's the trade-off.
You give up your strength for about 24 hours, okay?
Say the next 24 hours.
And Meg here is free as a bird and safe from harm.
We dance, we kiss, we schmooze, we carry on, we go home happy.
What d'ya say?
Come on.
People are gonna get hurt, aren't they?
Nah!
I mean, it's a possibility.
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war.
But what can I tell ya?
Anyway, what do you owe these people?
Isn't Meg, little smoochy face, isn't she more important than they are?
Stop it!
Isn't she?
You've gotta swear she'll be safe from any harm.
Fine, okay.
I'll give you that one.
Meg is safe, otherwise you get your strength right back.
Fine print.
Boilerplate.
Okay?
Done.
What d'ya say we shake on it?
Hey, I really don't have, like, time to bat this around.
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August.
Okay?
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice...
All right!
Yes, we're there!
You may feel just a little queasy.
It's kinda natural.
Maybe you should sit down!
Now you know how it feels to be just like everybody else.
Isn't it just peachy?
You'll love this.
One more thing.
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.
You're off the hook.
And by the way, Herc, is she not a fabulous little actress?
Stop it.
What do you mean?
I mean your little chickie-poo here was working for me all the time.
You're...
You're lying!
Help!
Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.
Couldn't have done it without you, sugar, sweetheart, babe.
No!
It's not like that.
I didn't mean to...
I couldn't...
I...
I'm so sorry.
Our hero's a zero!
Our hero's a zero!
Well, gotta blaze.
There's a whole cosmos up there waiting for me with, hey, my name on it.
So much for the preliminaries, and now on to the main event!
Brothers!
Titans!
Look at you in your squalid prison!
Who put you down there?
Zeus!
And now that I set you free, what is the first thing you are going to do?
Destroy him!
Good answer.
Crush Zeus!
Freeze him!
Melt Zeus!
Blow him away!
Zeus!
Guys?
Olympus would be that way.
Zeus!
Freeze him!
Hold it, bright eye.
I have a special job for you, my optic friend.
Destroy Zeus!
We're in trouble!
Big trouble!
I gotta...
My lord and lady, the Titans have escaped, and they're practically at our gates!
Sound the alarm!
Launch an immediate counterattack!
Go!
Go!
Gone, babe.
Charge!
On to battle!
You windbag!
Hercules!
Where are you?
What can we do?
Where is Hercules?
Yeah, Hercules'll save us.
Hercules!
Come out!
Face me!
What are you doing?
Without your strength, you'll be killed.
There are worse things.
Run!
Wait!
Stop!
Hey, look!
It's Hercules.
Thank the gods!
We're saved!
So...
You mighty Hercules.
Easy, horsefeathers.
Stop twitching.
Listen.
Hercules is in trouble.
We've gotta find Phil.
He's the only one who can talk some sense into him.
Get back, blast you!
Chihuahua.
Zeus!
Come on!
Hurry up!
We're shovin' off here!
Phil!
Phil, Hercules needs your help!
What does he need me for when he's got friends like you?
He won't listen to me.
Good!
He's finally learned something.
Look, I know what I did was wrong, but this isn't about me.
It's about him.
If you don't help him now, Phil, he'll die.
I need more thunderbolts!
Hephaestus has been captured, my lord.
Everyone's been captured.
I've been captured!
Hey, hey!
Watch the glasses.
Zeusy, I'm home!
Hades.
You're behind this!
You are correct, sir!
Flea.
Hercules!
Phil.
Come on, kid.
Come on.
Fight back.
Come on, you can take this bum.
This guy's a pushover.
Look at him.
You were right all along, Phil.
Dreams are for rookies.
No, no, no, no, kid.
Givin' up is for rookies.
I came back 'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.
I'm willing to go the distance.
How 'bout you?
Me bite off head!
Whoa, baby!
Hercules!
Look out!
Meg!
No!
What's happening?
Hades' deal is broken.
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.
Meg.
Why did you...
You didn't have to...
People always do crazy things when they're in love.
Meg.
Meg, I...
I...
Are you always this articulate?
You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.
I'll watch over her, kid.
You're gonna be all right.
I promise.
Let's go, Pegasus!
Hup, two, three, four.
Come on, everybody!
I can't hear you!
I swear to you, Hades, when I get out of this...
I'm the one giving orders now, bolt boy.
And I think I'm gonna like it here.
Don't get too comfortable, Hades!
Hercules!
This ought to even the odds!
Yeah, Hercules!
Thank you, man.
Get them!
Hey!
No!
Get him!
Not me!
Him!
Follow the fingers!
Him!
The yutz with the horse.
Thank you, my boy.
Nice horsey!
My intentions were pure!
I really was attracted to you.
Throw!
Now watch your old man work!
Guys, get your titanic rears in gear and kick some Olympian butt!
Is my hair out?
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy.
But at least I've got one swell consolation prize, a friend of yours who's dying to see me.
Meg.
Meg.
Meg, no.
I'm sorry, kid.
There's some things you just can't change.
Yes, I can.
We were so close!
So close.
We tripped at the finish line.
Why?
Because our little nut, Meg, has to go all noble.
Where's Meg?
Look who's here.
Wonderboy, you are too much.
Let her go.
Get a grip.
Come here, come here.
Let me show you around.
Well, well.
It's a small underworld after all.
Huh?
Meg!
No, no, no.
Mustn't touch.
You see, Meg's running with a new crowd these days.
And not a very lively one, at that.
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.
Well.
The son of my hated rival trapped forever in a river of death.
Going once.
Is there a downside to this?
Going twice!
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You get her out.
She goes, you stay.
You know what slipped my mind?
You'll be dead before you can get to her.
That's not a problem, is it?
What's the matter with these scissors?
The thread won't cut.
This is...
This is impossible!
You can't be alive!
You'd have to be a...
A god?
A god?
Hercules, stop!
You can't do this to me.
You can't...
Fine.
Okay.
Listen.
Okay.
Well, I deserved that.
Herc, Herc, Herc.
Can we talk?
Your dad, he's a fun guy, right?
So maybe you could put in a word with him, and he'd kinda blow this whole thing off, you know?
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
A little schmooze...
Get away from me!
Don't touch me!
Get your slimy souls off me!
He's not gonna be happy when he gets outta there.
You mean, if he gets outta there.
If.
If is good.
Taxi!
I don't feel so good.
I feel a little...
Wonderboy, what...
Why did you...
People always do crazy things when they're in love.
Hey, hey, hey!
Three cheers for the mighty Hercules!
Yeah!
Flowers for everybody!
Hercules, we're so proud of you.
Mother.
Fine work, my boy!
You've done it!
You're a true hero.
You were willing to give your life to rescue this young woman.
For a true hero isn't measured by the size of his strength, but by the strength of his heart.
Now, at last, my son, you can come home.
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.
Father, this is the moment I've always dreamed of.
But...
A life without Meg, even an immortal life, would be empty.
I...
I wish to stay on Earth with her.
I finally know where I belong.
Hit it, ladies!
Gonna shout it from the mountaintops A star is born It's the time for pulling out the stops A star is born Honey, hit us with a hallelu That kid came shining through Girl, sing the song Come blow your horn A star is born He's a hero who can please the crowd A star is born Come on, everybody shout out loud A star is born Just remember in the darkest hour within your heart's the power For makin' you a hero, too So don't lose hope when you're forlorn That's Phil's boy!
Just keep your eyes upon the skies Every night, a star is Right in sight, a star is Burning bright, a star is born A star is born What d'ya say?
It's happy ending time!
Everybody's got a little taste of somethin' but me.
I got nothin'.
I'm here with nothin'.
Anybody listenin'?
It's like I'm...
What am I, an echo or something?
Hello?
Hello?
Am I talking to, what?
Hyperspace?
Hello, it's me.
Nobody listens.
When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are Anything your heart desires Will come to you If your heart is in your dream No request is too extreme When you wish upon a star As dreamers do Fate is kind She brings to those who love The sweet fulfillment of Their secret longing Like a bolt out of the blue Fate steps in And sees you through When you wish upon a star Your dreams Come true Pretty.
I'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that, about a wish coming true, do you?
Well, I didn't either.
Of course, I'm just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth, but let me tell you what made me change my mind.
One night a long time...
Pardon me.
Wait till I fix this thing.
There.
One night a long time ago, my travels took me to a quaint little village.
It was a beautiful night.
The stars were shining like diamonds, high above the roofs of that sleepy old town.
Pretty as a picture.
As I wandered along the crooked streets, there wasn't a soul to be seen.
The only sign of life was a lighted window in the shop of a wood-carver named Geppetto.
So I hopped over... ...and looked in.
It was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste.
So what do I do?
I go in!
I looked around.
Of course, being in a strange place like that, I didn't know what to expect.
A cricket can't be too careful, you know.
Soon as I saw there was no one about, I made myself at home.
As I stood there warming my... ...myself, I took a look around.
Well, sir, you never saw such a place.
The most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on, and all carved out of wood.
And cute little music boxes, each one a work of art.
And shelf after shelf of toys and...
And then something else caught my eye.
A puppet!
You know, one of those marionette things, all strings and joints.
Cute little fellow.
Going up?
Good piece of wood too.
Well, now, it won't take much longer.
Just a little more paint and he's all finished.
I think he'll be all right.
Don't you, Figaro?
Beg pardon.
See?
That makes a big difference.
Very good.
Very, very good.
Well, you can't please everybody.
Now I have just the name for you.
Pinocchio!
Do you like it, Figaro?
No?
You do, don't you, Cleo?
Well, we'll leave it to little woodenhead.
Do you like it?
That settles it!
Pinocchio it is!
Come on, now, we'll try you out.
Music, Professor!
Take it easy there!
Break it up, will you?
Lotta down beats in there.
Little woodenhead go play your part Bring a little joy to every heart Little do you know and yet it's true That I'm mighty proud of you Little wooden feet and best of all Little wooden seat in case you fall How graceful!
My little woodenhead Cleo, meet Pinocchio.
Say, "How do you do?" Say hello to Figaro.
Up to mischief already.
You see what happens?
Up we go!
You're a cute little fellow.
And that smile!
You know, I...
You rascal!
Jealous?
You know, Pinocchio, I think Figaro is jealous of you.
Don't worry, Figaro.
I sti...
I wonder what time it is?
It's getting late.
Come now.
We go to bed.
Good night, Pinocchio.
Little funny face.
Good night, Cleo, my little water baby.
Figaro... ...you say good night too.
Go on!
Now go to sleep, my little mermaid.
Good night.
This is my idea of comfort.
Solid comfort.
Look at him, Figaro.
He almost looks alive!
Wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy?
Oh, well.
Come on.
We go to sleep.
Oh, Figaro.
I forgot to open the window.
Figaro, look, look, the wishing star!
Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I make tonight.
Figaro, you know what I wished?
I wished that my little Pinocchio might be a real boy.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think.
A real boy.
A very lovely thought, but not at all practical.
A real... ...boy.
Quiet!
After all, enough's enough.
Now what's up?
Hey, what's going on here?
As I live and breathe, a fairy!
Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others.
You deserve to have your wish come true.
Little puppet made of pine, wake.
The gift of life is thine.
What they can't do these days.
I can move!
I can talk!
I can walk!
Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
Why?
Because, tonight, Geppetto wished for a real boy.
Am I a real boy?
No, Pinocchio.
To make Geppetto's wish come true will be entirely up to you.
Up to me?
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish, and someday you will be a real boy.
A real boy!
That won't be easy.
You must learn to choose between right and wrong.
Right and wrong?
But how will I know?
How'll he know!
Your conscience will tell you.
What are conscience?
What are conscience!
I'll tell ya!
A conscience is that still, small voice that people won't listen to.
That's just the trouble with the world today.
Are you my conscience?
Who, me?
Would you like to be Pinocchio's conscience?
Well...
Very well.
What is your name?
Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.
Kneel, Mr.
Cricket.
No tricks now.
I dub you Pinocchio's conscience.
Lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong, counselor in moments of temptation and guide along the straight and narrow path.
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.
Well!
My, my!
Say, that's pretty swell.
Gee, thanks!
But don't I get a badge or somethin'?
Well, we'll see.
You mean, maybe I will?
I shouldn't wonder.
Make it a gold one?
Maybe.
Now remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy.
And always let your conscience be your guide.
Goodbye, milady.
Goodbye.
Not bad, says I.
Oh, yeah!
Almost forgot about you.
Well, Pinoke...
Maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk.
Why?
Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you?
All right, sit down, son.
Now, you see, the world is full of temptations.
Temptations?
Yep!
Temptations.
They're the wrong things that seem right at the time, but even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things... ...may be right at the wrong time, or vice versa.
Understand?
But I'm gonna do right.
Attaboy, Pinoke, and I'm gonna help ya.
And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle.
Like this.
Like this?
No, no.
Try it again, Pinoke.
Like this?
No, son.
Now listen!
That's it!
Come on, now.
Let's sing it!
When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong Give a little whistle Give a little whistle When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong Give a little whistle Give a little whistle Not just a little squeak Pucker up and blow And if your whistle's weak, yell Jiminy Cricket?
Take the straight and narrow path And if you start to slide give a little whistle Give a little whistle And always let your conscience be your guide Take the straight and narrow path And if you start to slide Give a little whistle Give a little whistle And always let your conscience be your guide And always let your conscience be your guide Who is there?
It's me.
Oh, it's me.
Figaro.
There's somebody in here.
Careful now, Figaro.
He might spring out on us at any time.
He's in here somewhere.
Here I am!
Pinocchio!
How did you get down here?
I fell down.
Oh, you did.
You are talking.
No, no, no!
Yes!
And I can move too!
No, no, you can't!
I'm dreaming in my sleep!
Wake me up!
Wake me up!
Now we see who's dreaming.
Go on... say something.
Gee, you're funny.
Do it again!
You do talk!
Yes!
The blue fairy came.
The blue fairy?
And I got a conscience.
A conscience!
And, someday, I'm gonna be a real boy.
A real boy!
It is my wish, it's come true!
Figaro, look!
He's alive, he can talk!
Say hello to Figaro.
Hello to Figaro.
Oh, Cleo!
I almost forgot.
Look, it's Pinocchio!
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?
Yeah, cute!
This calls for a celebration!
Music!
You start one, Pinocchio.
Oh, boy.
A party!
Mind if I cut in?
How 'bout sitting out the next one, babe?
Lemme out!
Lemme out!
Come, Cleo, join the party!
Dance!
Nice!
Gathering toys For my little boy Look... pretty!
Help!
Where's the bucket?
Help!
Water!
Water!
Here it is!
I got it!
Here's water.
Here's some water.
Help!
Where's water?
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed before something else happens.
Little man, you've had a busy night.
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.
Why?
Everybody has to sleep.
Figaro goes to sleep, and Cleo.
And, besides, tomorrow you've got to go to school.
Why?
Oh, to learn things... ...and get smart.
Why?
Because.
Look, Father.
Look!
Wait!
Stand still now.
What are those?
Oh, those!
They are your schoolmates, girls and boys.
Now get in.
Real boys?
Yes!
But hurry now.
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait.
Here's an apple for the teacher.
Now turn around and let me look you over.
Yeah, yeah.
Here.
Run along now.
Wait, wait.
Come back here, Figaro.
School is not for you.
Goodbye, Father!
Goodbye, son.
Hurry back.
Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter of little innocent children wending their way to school.
Thirsty little minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge.
School, a noble institution.
What would this stupid world be without...
Well, well, well!
Stromboli!
So that old rascal's back in town?
Remember, Giddy, the time I tied strings on you and passed you off as a puppet?
We nearly put one over on that old gypsy that time!
A little wooden boy.
Now, who...
A wooden boy!
Look, Giddy, look. it's amazing.
A live puppet without strings.
A thing like that ought to be worth a fortune to someone.
Now let me see.
That's it!
Stromboli!
Why, that fat, old faker would give his...
Listen.
If we play our cards right, we'll be on easy street, or my name isn't Honest John.
Quick!
We'll head him off.
Now's our...
No, no, stupid.
Don't be crude.
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.
Yes, Giddy, as I was saying to the duchess only yesterday...
How clumsy of me!
My, my, my.
I'm terribly sorry.
I do hope you're not injured.
I'm all right.
Splendid!
Well, well.
Quite a scholar, I see.
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.
Here's your book.
I'm going to school.
School!
Ah, yes.
Then you haven't heard of the easy road to success.
No?
I'm speaking, my boy, of the theater!
Here's your apple.
Bright lights, music, applause!
Fame!
Fame?
Yes!
And with that personality, that profile, that physique...
Why, he's a natural born actor.
But I'm going...
Straight to the top.
Why, I can see your name in lights, lights six feet high.
What is your name?
Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
P-l-N-U-O...
P-l...
We're wasting precious time.
Come.
On to the theater!

Fine conscience I turned out to be!
Late the first day.
Oh, well, he can't get in much trouble between here and school.
Oh, boy, a parade!
An actor's life for me Hi diddle de dee An actor's life for me A waxed moustache and a beaver coat A pony cart and a billy goat Why, it's... it's Pinoke!
Hey, where you going?

An actor's life for me Hold on there!
Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me With clothes that come from the finest shop What was that?
It's Jiminy!
Whatcha doin' up there?
Who?
What?
Jiminy?
Up where?
My boy, you must be seeing things.
Oh, no, that's my conscience.
He...
Now, now, now.
Just calm down.
Why, there's nothing up there to be afraid of.
Pinoke...
Pinoke.
Over here.
Over here.
Jiminy, I'm gonna be an actor!
All right, son.
Take it easy now.
Remember what I said about temptation?
Well, that's him.
Oh, no, Jiminy.
That's Mr.
Honest John!
Honest John?
Get me outta here!
All right then, here's what we'll tell 'em.
You can't go to the theater.
Say, "Thank you just the same." You're sorry, but you've got to go to school.
Pinocchio?
Here they come, Pinoke.
Now you tell 'em.
Oh, little boy!
There you are!
Where were we?
Yes... on to the theater!
Goodbye, Jiminy, goodbye!
Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me Goodbye?
Pinoke, you can't go!
A high silk hat and a silver cane There he goes.
A watch of gold with a diamond chain What'll I do?
I'll run and tell his father.
No, that'd be snitching.
I'll go after him myself.
Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude the performance of this great show, Stromboli, the master showman...
That's me. ...and by special permission of the management...
That's me too. ...is presenting to you something you will absolutely refuse to believe!
Well, looks like a sellout.
Introducing the only marionette who can sing and dance absolutely without the aids of strings.
I hope so.
The one... and only...
Pinocchio!
What a buildup.
I got no strings to hold me do...
Go ahead... make a fool of yourself!
Then, maybe, you'll listen to your conscience.
Cute kid.
I got no strings to hold me down To make me fret or make me frown I had strings, but now I'm free There are no strings on me Heigh ho the merry-o That's the only way to be I want the world to know Nothing ever worries me I got no strings...
What I told you?
They got strings, but you can see There are no strings on me You have no strings Your arms is free To love me by the Zuider Zee Ya-ya-ya if you would woo I'd bust my strings for you You've got no strings Comme ci comme ça Your savoir faire is ooo-la-la I've got strings, but entre nous I'd cut my strings for you Down where the Volga flows There's a Russian rendezvous Where me and Ivan go but I'd rather go with you There are no strings on me They like him.
He's a success.
Maybe I was wrong.
Well, guess he won't need me anymore.
What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?
What could have happened to him?
Where could he be at this hour?
I'd better go out again and look for him.
And, remember, nobody eats a bite until I find him.
I got no strings, but I got the brain I got no strings, but I got the brain I buy a new suit and I swing the cane I eat the best and I drink champagne I got no strings on me Bravo, Pinocchio!
They liked me!
Two hundred.
You are sensational!
You mean I'm good?
Three hundred.
You are colossal!
Does that mean I'm an actor?
Sure!
I will push you in the public's eye.
Your face, she will be on everybody's tongue.
Will she?
What's this?
For you, my little Pinocchio.
For me?
Gee, thanks!
I'll run right home and tell my father.
Home?
Oh, sure.
Going home to your father.
That is very "comeecal." You mean, it's funny?
Oh, sure!
Yes.
I'll be back in the morning.
Be back in the morning!
Going home?
There, this will be your home...
Where I can find you always!
No, no, no!
Yes, yes, yes!
To me... you are belonging.
We will tour the world.
Paris.
London.
Monte Carlo. "Constantinopolee." No, no!
Yes!
We start tonight!
You will make lots of money... for me!
And when you are growing too old, you will make good firewood!
Let me outta here.
I gotta get out!
You can't keep me!
Quiet!
Shut up!
Before I knock you silly!
Good night, my little wooden gold mine.
No!
No, wait!
Lemme out!
I'll tell my father!
Giddy up!
Get along there.
Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy!
Jiminy, where are you?
Jiminy Cricket!
Well, there he goes.
Sitting in the lap of luxury, the world at his feet.
Oh, well, I can always say "I knew him when." I'll just go out of his life quietly.
I would like to wish him luck though.
Sure!
Why not?
Pinocchio?
Pinocchio?
It's me, your old friend, Jiminy.
Remember?
Jiminy!
I'm glad to see ya!
Pinocchio, what's happened?
What did he do to ya?
He was mad.
He said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye.
Yeah?
And just 'cause I'm a goldbrick, he's gonna chop me into firewood!
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.
I'll have you outta here in no time at all.
Why, this is just as easy... ...as rollin' off a...
Kinda rusty.
Needs a little oil.
Needs a little oil, needs a little oil.
That's what I said.
Must be one of the old models.
You mean, you can't open it?
Yeah.
Looks pretty hopeless.
It'll take a miracle to get us outta here.
Pinocchio?
Pinocchio.
Giddy up!
Pino...
A fine conscience I turned out to be.
I shoulda listened to you, Jiminy.
No, it was my fault.
I shouldn't have walked out on you.
Guess I'll never see my father again.
Buck up, son. it could be worse.
Be cheerful... like me!
Take it easy, son.
Come on, blow.
Attaboy.
Well, it stopped raining anyway.
Well, it stopped raining anyway.
Hey, that star again!
The lady!
The fairy!
What'll she say?
What'll I tell her?
You might tell her the truth.
Why, Pinocchio!
Hello!
Sir Jiminy!
Well!
This is a pleasant surprise!
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school?
School?
Well, I...
Go ahead, tell her.
I was going to school 'til I met somebody.
Met somebody?
Yeah, two big monsters!
With big green eyes.
Why, I...
Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?
No, ma'am.
But they tied me in a big sack.
You don't say!
And where was Sir Jiminy?
Jiminy?
Leave me outta this.
They put him in a little sack.
No!
Yeah!
How did you escape?
I didn't.
They chopped me into firewood!
Oh, look, my nose!
What's happened?
Perhaps you haven't been telling the truth.
Perhaps?
But I have!
Every single word!
Please help me.
I'm awful sorry.
You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing... ...until it's as plain as the nose on your face.
She's right, Pinoke, you better come clean.
I'll never lie again, honest, I won't.
Please, your honor, I mean...
Miss Fairy.
Give him another chance, for my sake.
Will ya, huh?
I'll forgive you this once.
But, remember, a boy who won't be good might just as well be made of wood.
We'll be good, won't we?
Very well, but this is the last time I can help you.
Gee, look, Jiminy!
My nose!
Hey, we're free.
Come on, Pinoke.
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane I eat the fish and I drink champagne I got no strings on me Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.
Goodbye, Mr.
Stromboli.
Quiet!
Let's get outta here before something else happens.
Hi diddle dee dee An actor's life for me A high silk hat and a silver cane A watch of gold with a diamond chain Hi diddle dee day An actor's life is gay It's great to be a celebrity An actor's life for me And the dummy fell for it.
Hook, line and sinker!
And he still thinks we're his friends!
And did Stromboli pay!
Plenty!
That shows you how low Honest John will stoop.
Eh, Giddy?
Now, Coachman...
What's your proposition?
Well... ...how would you blokes like to make some real money?
Well... and who do we have to...
No, no!
Nothing like that.
You see...
I'm collecting stupid little boys.
Stupid little boys?
You know, the disobedient ones what play hooky from school.
And you see...
Yes. ...and I takes 'em to Pleasure Island!
Pleasure Island.
Pleasure Island?
But the law, suppose they...
No, no.
There is no risk!
They never come back... ...as boys!
Now I've got a coach load leaving at midnight.
We'll meet at the crossroads, and no double-crossing!
No, sir.
Scout around.
Any good prospects you find, bring 'em to me.
Yes, chief.
I'll pay you well.
I got plenty of gold.
Yes, yes.
I got plenty of gold.
Yes, yes.
No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.
You'd better!
I will.
I'm going to school.
That's the stuff, Pinoke.
I'd rather be smart than be an actor.
Now you're talkin'!
Come on, slowpoke.
I'll race ya home.
Well, well, Pinocchio, what's your rush?
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello.
Well, how is the great actor?
I don't want to be an actor.
Stromboli was terrible!
He was?
Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage.
He did?
But I learned my lesson.
I'm going...
You poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.
That's it!
You are a nervous wreck.
We must diagnose this case at once.
Quick, doctor, your notebook.
Bless my soul.
My, my.
Just as I thought.
A slight touch of monetary complications with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions of the flying trapezes.
Say hippopotamus.
Hi-ho-hotamus.
I knew it!
Compound transmission of the pandemonium with percussion and spasmodic frantic disintegration!
Close your eyes.
What do you see?
Nothing.
Open them.
Now what do you see?
Spots!
Now that heart.
My goodness!
A palpitating syncopation of the killer diller with a wicky wacky stomping of the floy joy!
Quick, doctor, that report.
This makes it perfectly clear.
My boy, you are allergic.
Allergic?
Yes!
And there is only one cure.
A vacation on Pleasure Island.
Pleasure Island?
Yes!
That happy land of carefree boys where every day is a holiday!
But I can't go.
I...
Why, of course you can go.
I'm giving you my ticket.
Here.
Thanks!
But I'm...
I insist.
Your health comes first.
Come, the coach departs at midnight!
Hi diddle dee dee It's Pleasure Isle for me Where every day is a holiday And kids have nothing to do but play Pinoke?
Oh, Pinoke?
Now where do you suppose he...
Pinocchio!
Hey, come back.
Giddy up.
Well... ...here we go again.
My name's Lampwick.
What's yours?
Pinocchio.
Ever been to Pleasure Island?
But Mr.
Honest John gave me...
Me neither, but they say it's a swell joint.
No school, no cops.
You can tear the joint apart and nobody says a word.
Honest John gave me...
Loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink.
And it's all free!
Honest John...
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait!
Right here, boys!
Right here.
Get your cake, pie, dill pickles and ice cream.
Eat all you can.
Be a glutton.
Stuff yourselves. it's all free, boys.
It's all free.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
The rough house, the rough house.
It's the roughest, toughest joint ya ever seen.
Come in and pick a fight, boys.
Oh, boy, a scrap!
Come on.
Let's go in and poke somebody in the nose.
Why?
Just for the fun of it.
OK, Lampy.
Tobacco Row.
Get your cigars, cigarettes and chewin' tobacco.
Come in and smoke your heads off.
There's nobody here to stop you.
Pinocchio?
Pinocchio!
There's something phony about all this.
I gotta get him outta here!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
See the model home.
It's open for destruction, and it's all yours, boys!
She's all yours.
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?
Yeah!
Being bad's a lot of fun, ain't it?
Yeah.
Get a load of that strained-glass window.
All right, now.
Hop to it, you blokes.
Come on!
Come on!
Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.
Now get below and get them crates ready.
Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio.
Where is everybody?
The place is like a graveyard.
I don't like the looks of this.
Pinocchio!
Hey, where are you?
Where do you suppose all the kids went to?
They're around here somewheres.
What do you care?
You're havin' a good time, ain't ya?
I sure am.
Oh, boy!
This is the life, Pinoke.
Yeah!
It sure is!
You smoke like me grandmother!
Come on, take a big drag, like this.
OK, Lampy.
Some fun, huh, kid?
OK, Slats, your shot.
What's the matter, Slats?
Losing your grip?
Pinocchio!
So this is where I find you!
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
Look at yourself... smoking, playing pool!
You're comin' right home with me this minute!
Hey, who's the beetle?
Let go!
Put me down!
Let me out.
He's my conscience!
He tells me what's right and wrong.
What?
You mean to tell me you take orders from a grasshopper?
Grasshopper?
Look here, you impudent young pup!
It wouldn't hurt you to take orders from your grasshop... ...your conscience, if you have one.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.
Why, why... ya young hoodlum!
I'll knock your block off!
I'll take you apart and put you back together!
Don't hurt him.
He's my best friend.
Why, I'll...
Your best friend?
And what am I?
Just your conscience!
OK, that settles it!
But, Jiminy...
You buttered your bread, now sleep in it!
Go on, laugh.
Make a jackass outta yourself.
I'm through!
This is the end.
But Jiminy...
Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
Lampwick...
Come on, come on.
Let him go.
Lampwick...
Lampwick!
It burns me up.
After all I tried to do for him.
Who's his conscience, anyway?
Me or that hoodlum, Lampwick?
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.
Open up that door!
Open up!
I wanna go home.
Come on, you blokes, keep 'em moving!
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.
Where'd all the donkeys come from?
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.
And what's your name?
OK, you'll do!
In you go!
You boys'll bring a nice price.
All right, next!
And what might your name be?
Alexander.
So you can talk!
Yes, sir.
I wanna go home to my mama!
Take him back!
He can still talk!
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey.
Let me outta here!
Quiet!
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it!
Boys?
So that's what...
Pinocchio!
To hear that beetle talk... you'd think somethin' was gonna happen to us.
Conscience!
Phooey!
Where's he get that stuff?
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
What's he think I look like?
A jackass?
You sure do!
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.
Did that come outta me?
What the...
What's going on?
I've been double-crossed!
Help!
Help!
Somebody, help!
I've been framed!
Help!
Please, you gotta help me.
Be a pal.
Call that beetle.
Call anybody.
Mama?
Mama!
What's happened?
I hope I'm not too late.
What'll I do?
Pinocchio!
Jiminy!
Oh, Jiminy, help!
Pinoke, the kids, the boys, they're all donkeys!
You too.
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.
Hurry up before they see us.
You gotta jump!
Jiminy...
Jiminy, you all right?
Sure!
I thought we'd never make it.
Certainly feels good to be back on dry land.
Come on, let's get home.
Father, Father, I'm home!
We're home, Mr.
Geppetto.
Home again.
It's me, Pinocchio!
I'm home to stay.
Here he is, Mr.
Geppetto.
Home at last.
Hey, maybe he's asleep.
Father?
Father, it's me.
Pinoke, come here.
Look.
He ain't here.
He...
He's gone.
Yeah, and Figaro.
And Cleo too.
Maybe something awful happened to him.
Don't worry, son, he probably hasn't gone far.
Hey!
It's a message.
What's it say?
It's about your father.
Where is he?
Why, it says here he went looking for you and he was swallowed by a whale.
Swallowed by a whale?
Yeah.
A whale?
A whale named Monstro.
But wait, he's alive.
Alive?
Where?
Why, inside the whale at the bottom of the sea.
Bottom of the sea?
Hey, where you going?
I'm going to find him.
Pinoke, are you crazy?
Don't you realize he's in a whale?
I've gotta go to him.
Hey, Pinoke, wait!
Listen here, son...
But this Monstro, I've heard of him.
He's a whale of a whale!
He swallows whole ships alive!
Tie it good and tight now.
And, besides, it's dangerous.
Bye, Jiminy.
Goodbye?
I may be live bait down there, but I'm with ya.
Come on... let's go.
Look out below!
Gangway, down there.
What a big place.
Come on, Jiminy.
All right.
Soon as I take on some ballast.
One side, sister.
Well... so long.
Put it in the wrong end.
No more privacy than a goldfish.
Chilly.
Father?
Father?
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!
Father?
Father!
He ain't my father.
Mr.
Geppetto!
Hey!
What the...
Hey, let go!
Run along, you little... squirt.
What's the matter?
Can't a fellow...
I was only...
We were only looking for Monstro.
That got 'em.
Father?
Father?
Hello.
Can you tell me where we can find Monstro, the whale?
Gee!
They're scared.
Pardon me, pearl, are you acquainted with Monstro, the whale?
Hold it there.
Father?
One side there, son.
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.
Hey!
What the...
Whoa, quit shovin'.
Don't crowd.
Take it easy there.
Whoa, there.
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.
Could any of you tell me where to find Monstro?
Whoa, boy!
Whoa!
Hey!
Sakes alive.
Father?
Father?
Mr.
Geppetto?
Not a bite for days.
We can't hold out much longer.
I never thought... it would end this way, Figaro.
Starving to death in the belly of a whale.
My poor little Pinocchio.
He was such a good boy.
It's hopeless, Figaro.
There isn't a fish left.
If the monster doesn't wake up soon, I'm afraid we... we are done for.
Here they come!
Tuna!
Oh, tuna fish!
Food!
We'll eat!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
Have you seen...
Monstro!
We gotta get outta here.
Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me!
Never saw so many!
Here's another one.
Enough for weeks!
Here's a big one.
Keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey, blubber mouth, open up.
I gotta get in there.
Looks like the last of them.
Here's a big one.
Only a few left.
We gotta work fast.
Hey!
Here's another one.
Hey, Father!
Father!
Don't bother me now, Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
Father!
Pinocchio, my son!
Hey, Father, here I am.
Oh, yes!
Pinocchio, my boy!
I'm so happy to see you.
Me too, Father.
Figaro!
Figaro.
Cleo!
Oh, Cleo!
You're here too.
Yes!
We're all together again.
You are soaking wet.
Yes, Father.
You mustn't catch cold.
But I came to save you.
You know, you shouldn't have come down here.
But, Father.
But I'm awfully glad to see you.
Let me take your hat.
Pinocchio!
What's the matter?
Those ears!
Ears?
Oh, these!
That's nothing.
I got a tail, too!
Pinocchio!
What's happened to you?
Well, I...
I...
I...
Never mind now.
Old Geppetto has his little woodenhead.
Nothing else matters!
I gotta get in!
My pal's in there.
Come on, ya big moose!
Open up, I tell ya!
Hey!
Cut it out.
Hey, beat it, you buzzards!
Get out?
Oh, no, no, son.
I have tried every way.
Why, I even built a raft.
A raft?
That's it!
We'll take the raft and when the whale opens his mouth...
No, no, no, no.
Now, listen, son.
He only opens his mouth when he's eating.
Then everything comes in, nothing goes out.
It's hopeless, Pinocchio.
Come, we make a nice fire and we cook some of the fish.
A fire!
That's it!
Yes!
And then we'll all eat again.
A great big fire!
Lots of smoke.
Smoke?
Yes, sure.
A smoked fish will taste good.
Quick, some wood.
Pinocchio, not the chair.
Hurry, Father, more wood!
What'll we sit on?
We won't need it.
We're getting out!
Getting out?
But how?
We'll make him sneeze!
Make him sneeze?
That will make him mad!
Well, it's about time!
It won't work.
Hurry, Father.
Climb aboard.
We'll never get by those teeth!
Yes, we will!
Hey, which way are you going?
Wait for me!
Hang on.
Here we go!
Gesundheit.
We're going back!
No, we'll make it.
Faster, faster!
It's no use.
We're done for!
We made it!
Look!
Now he is mad!
I told you he'd be furious!
He's gone.
Where'd he go?
Look out!
Hang on!
He's coming back.
Hurry!
He's trying to kill us!
Paddle, son!
Let's go back!
Look out!
Jump!
Father?
Father?
Oh, Father!
Pinocchio, swim for shore.
Swim for shore.
Hang on, Father.
Save... yourself.
Pinocchio... save yourself.
Don't mind me, son.
Save yourself...
Pinocchio.
Pinocchio!
Oh, Pinocchio!
Pino...
My boy!
My brave little boy.
Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish and someday you will be a real boy.
Awake, Pinocchio.
Awake.
Father, whatcha cryin' for?
Because... you're dead, Pinocchio.
No!
No, I'm not!
Yes, yes you are.
Now lie down.
But, Father, I'm alive.
See?
And I'm...
I'm...
I'm real!
I'm a real boy!
You're alive and... and you are a real boy!
A real live boy.
This calls for a celebration!
Professor, lots of music!
Well!
This is practically where I came in.
Thank you, milady.
He deserved to be a real boy.
It sure was nice of you to...
Well, I'll be!
My, my!
Solid gold too.
I think it's swell!

MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO Dad, do you want some candy?
Thanks.
Aren't you tired?
No.
We're almost there.
Mei, hide!
It wasn't a policeman.
Hello!
Hello.
Are your parents around?
Thanks.
I'm Kusakabe!
We've just arrived!
A pleasure to meet you!
Welcome!
Thank you.
Here we are!
Wait!
Mei, there's a bridge!
A bridge?
See that flash?
Fish too!
So, you like it here?
Dad, it's terrific!
Look, a tunnel of trees!
Is that our house?
Come on!
It's a wreck!
Wreck!
Looks like a haunted house!
Haunted?
And it's all rotten!
It's gonna fall down!
Fall down!
Look, Mei!
See?
It's huge.
Dad, there's a huge tree!
It's a camphor tree.
Camphor tree!
Camphor tree!
Oops!
An acorn!
Show me.
Another one!
It's mine.
Out of the way.
I can't open the screens.
Acorns!
There are acorns in the house.
They fell from up there!
Maybe there are squirrels in here.
Squirrels, really?
Or rats; they like acorns too.
I'd rather have squirrels!
Where shall I put this?
Here, I'll get the door for you.
Satsuki, open up the kitchen.
Okay.
It's just round the back.
Mei, come on!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
Ready?
Bathtubs.
There's nothing here.
That's the bathroom.
Dad, there's something in here.
A squirrel?
Dunno.
A bunch of black things, but not roaches or mice.
Really?
Can you see them?
I think they were dust bunnies.
Dust bunnies?
Like in my picture book?
That's right.
Ghosts don't come out on days like this.
When you walk into a dark room from outside, your eyes dim and the dust bunnies come out.
Oh, I see.
Come here, dust bunnies.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Let's get to work!
See if you can find how to get upstairs.
Get up there and open all the windows.
Sure!
I'm coming, too!
Toilet!
Not here!
Not here!
Not here!
Not here!
Not here!
Not here!
Nothing here!
Nothing!
Mei, it's here!
It's pitch black!
Dust bunnies...
Another acorn.
Come out, dust bunnies!
Are you there, Mr.
Dust Bunny?
One, two...
One, two...
Dad, there's definitely something here!
That's exciting!
I've always wanted to live in a haunted house.
Oh, no!
I'm coming!
I got it.
Satsuki!
Mei.
You're full of energy!
This is Nanny.
She has come to look after the house.
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.
Nice to meet you both.
I'd have cleaned up if I'd known you'd be this quick.
No, you've done plenty.
I've been so busy in the rice paddies, I only did a bit of dusting...
What have you done to your hands?
The dust bunny got away.
Your feet, too!
Mine are black, too!
Well, well, well.
That must be the soot spreaders.
Those little, black, fuzzy things that fly?
That's right.
They breed in empty old houses, and cover them with soot and dust.
I could see them when I was little.
Now you can too, huh?
Are they like goblins?
No, nothing so scary.
If you keep smiling, they'll soon leave the house.
They're probably deciding where to go next, right now.
Mei, they're going away.
That's no fun.
What happens if a huge one comes out, like this?
I wouldn't be scared.
Okay then, I won't walk you to the bathroom at night.
Okay, cleaning time.
Could you get some water from the stream?
From the stream?
I'm coming, too!
Mei, wait there.
Did you get a fish?
Nanny, it's coming out!
Good, keep pumping 'til the water gets cold.
Okay!
May I help you?
Huh... my mom... for Granny.
Yes?
Wait, what is it?
Is that you, Kanta?
You live in a haunted house!
Kanta, stop it!
I did the same kind of thing when I was his age.
I hate boys.
But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!
Eat as much as you want.
Thank you!
Thank you so much for your help.
Goodbye!
Dad, the house is going to fall down.
I hope not; we've only just moved in.
Come on, let's laugh to keep the bogeymen away!
I'm not scared.
I mean it.
I'm not scared!
One, two...
Come on, keep up the good work.
Okay!
Washing, finished!
Here we go!
Nanny!
Hello!
Hard at work?
Where are you all heading?
To visit Mommy in the hospital!
That's nice.
Give her my regards!
Okay!
This way.
Hello.
Hello there.
Mommy!
So glad you came, my dear.
Daddy took the wrong road.
Really?
Hello, Satsuki.
It's a school holiday, today.
How nice.
Daddy is talking to the doctor.
It's so good to see you all.
Have you settled into the new house?
A haunted house?
Mom, do you like ghosts?
Of course I do!
I can't wait to see them.
See, I told you, Mei.
Mei was worried that you wouldn't like ghosts.
What about you two?
I love them!
I'm not scared of them!
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?
It's really good.
Lucky girl, Mei.
But she always gets mad at me. 'Cause you won't stay still.
Come here, Satsuki.
Isn't yours too short?
No, I like it like this.
Do mine, Mommy.
Mine, too.
Wait your turn!
Wavy hair, just like mine when I was your age.
Will it be like yours when I grow up?
Probably.
You take after your mom.
Mom looked really well.
You're right.
The doctor says she'll be home soon.
Soon?
Like tomorrow?
You always say that.
Tomorrow is a little too soon.
Mom said she'll sleep with me in my bed.
Weren't you saying you're big enough to sleep alone?
Mom is special!
Dad, time to get up!
Wake up!
Sorry, I overslept again.
I've got to bring a box lunch today.
I totally forgot about it.
It's all right.
I've made something for all of us.
It's burning.
Let me do it.
Here, this is yours, Mei.
It's for me!
Mei, sit down and eat!
Okay.
Here, wrap yours.
Satsuki!
Uh-oh.
I'm coming!
You made a friend already?
She's calling you!
Yeah, that's Michiko.
Gotta go!
See you!
Have a good day!
Morning!
Hi, let's go.
Hi!
Good morning!
Daddy!
Do I look all grown up?
Yes, dear.
Where are you going?
I'm just going out.
Daddy, is it lunch yet?
Already?
You be the flower shop, Daddy.
Pole-tads!
Got no bottom.
Gotcha!
Who are you?
A big dust bunny?
To-to-ro?
You're Totoro!
I bet you're Totoro.
Totoro.
See you!
Okay, catch you later!
I'm home!
Hey there.
Is it that late already?
Where's Mei?
I'm off to Michiko's.
We haven't eaten yet.
Is Mei in the garden?
Mei!
Mei!
Mei!
Mei!
Dad, I found her hat!
Mei?
Wake up, Mei!
You shouldn't sleep here!
Where's Totoro?
Totoro?
Where?
Were you dreaming?
Totoro was here.
You mean that troll in your picture book?
Yeah.
He was all hairy with a big mouth like this.
There's a tiny one and a little one and a huge one like this.
There you are.
What a great hiding place.
Dad, Mei said she saw a Totoro here.
A Totoro?
It's this way.
Hey, wait for me!
It's here.
Is it?
No.
It went to a big tree.
But there wasn't any other path.
Come back, Mei!
Mei!
Come back!
But it's true!
Totoro was here.
I'm not lying.
I know, Mei.
I didn't lie.
Neither of us think you're lying.
You probably met the king of this forest.
You were very lucky.
He doesn't come out very often.
We should go to the shrine to pay our respects.
Pay our respects?
To this forest.
Mei, you're getting heavy.
Dad, look!
The camphor tree!
What a big tree.
It's here!
Is that the tree?
Dad, hurry up.
The hole has gone.
Are you sure it was here?
The hole disappeared.
I told you that he doesn't come to see us often.
But will he come again?
I want to meet him, too.
If you're lucky, sure.
What a beautiful tree.
This tree must have stood here for years and years.
Trees and people used to be good friends.
I saw that tree and decided to buy the house.
I hope Mom likes it too.
Okay, let's pay our respects, then get home for lunch.
Oh yeah, I promised to go see Michiko!
I want to go, too!
Attention!
Thank you for looking after Mei.
Thank you very much!
Last one home's a rotten egg!
That's not fair!
Dad!
Wait!
Hurry up!
Wait for me!
Dear Mother, something amazing happened today.
Mei met a giant Totoro.
And I'm hoping to see him myself soon, too.
Kanta, hurry up!
You'll be late!
Coming...
WAIT, RIVER, PINE TREE Well, well!
Mei?
Excuse me!
Yes, Satsuki?
It's my sister...
Sister?
Where?
What happened, Nanny?
I'm sorry.
She insisted that she be with you.
It's Dad's day at the university.
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.
I still have two more classes and Nanny's too busy for this.
She was good up 'til now, weren't you?
I'll go talk to my teacher.
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital, I want you all to be nice to her.
Yes, Miss!
What's that?
It's Totoro.
Mei, you should keep quiet.
Okay.
See you!
Bye-bye, Mei!
I can't stay after class today.
We'll let teacher know.
See you!
Hurry up, it's going to rain!
Okay.
Here it comes!
Here.
I won't cry.
Aren't I good?
It's getting worse.
Dear Guardian Spirit, let us stay until the rain stops.
But...
That was lucky.
It's got holes in it.
Daddy forgot his umbrella.
I'm going, too.
I said I forgot it!
What idiot forgets his umbrella on a rainy day?
Ouch!
You broke it playing, I bet.
I did not!
Excuse me.
Hello, Satsuki.
Hi, Mei.
Grandma!
I'm sorry about Mei today.
Not at all.
Sorry we couldn't do more.
Kanta lent us this umbrella.
He did?
A broken old thing like that!
Mei was with me, so I was glad.
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.
Not at all.
It probably cleaned him up a little.
Are you off to meet your father?
Yes.
What good girls you are.
Bye-bye, Mei.
Bye-bye.
Who was that?
I don't know.
Just in time!
DESTINATION MAEZAWA, INARIMAE STATION TOKYO ELECTRIC RAILWAY BUS Getting on?
All right, drive on.
TOKYO BUS COMPANY Daddy wasn't on it.
He'll be on the next one.
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?
Are you okay?
Are you sleepy?
I told you.
Wanna go to Nanny's?
Not much longer.
Hang on.
It's late...
Come on.
Are you Totoro?
Wait a minute.
You can use this.
Take it, Mei's slipping off.
Hold it like this.
Here's the bus!
TSUKAMORI INARIMAE He took Daddy's umbrella.
I'm sorry.
Drive on.
The train was late and I missed the bus.
Were you worried?
We met him, Dad!
He was here!
And the cat bus!
What?
It was huge!
With big eyes like this!
We met him!
We met Totoro!
How wonderful!
Come on, Daddy.
Dear Mother, I can't tell you how excited I was today.
It was the scariest, funniest day I've ever had.
Totoro gave us a lovely present wrapped in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers.
When we opened it, it was full of magic nuts and seeds! "We decided to plant them in the garden to make a lovely forest." But they haven't sprouted yet.
Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.
She looks like a little crab.
CRAB MEI It's nearly summer vacation.
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon.
Love, Satsuki.
Come on.
Bed time.
Lights off!
Wait, Dad.
Daddy, do you think they will come out tomorrow?
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know.
Night night.
Wake up, Mei!
That's where we planted the seeds.
Wow, we did it!
We're the wind!
There are no trees!
Yes!
It was a dream.
But it wasn't a dream.
We did it!
Mr.
Kusakabe!
Telegram!
Mr.
Kusakabe!
Anyone home?
Nanny?
I'm here.
This one is ripe.
What about this one?
That's good, too.
Your garden is a treasure trove.
Let's take a little break.
These should be cold now.
Looks delicious.
So good.
The sun blessed these, so they're really good for you.
Would they help my mom?
Of course.
If she eats my vegetables, she'll get better right away.
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.
She'll sleep in my bed!
At last.
That's wonderful.
But it's only for a couple of days.
To get used to the new house.
I see.
We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.
I'll give her this corn I picked.
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.
I know.
There was a telegram for you.
For us?
Dad won't be back till late, what shall I do?
Open it, it might be important.
Please contact, hospital...
It's from Mom's hospital!
Something's happened to her!
Nanny!
What shall I do?
Calm down.
Do you know where your dad is?
I know his office number, but we don't have a telephone.
Kanta, take her to use the phone in the main house!
Mei, stay here with me!
Stay with Nanny, Mei!
Hello, I'd like to make a long-distance call.
It's Tokyo 31 1382.
A cute girl, Kanta.
Hello?
Yes?
Hello, may I speak to Dad...
Mr.
Kusakabe?
It's his daughter, Satsuki.
Daddy?
It's me, Satsuki!
Hello, what's wrong?
From the hospital?
Okay, I'll call them right away.
Is there anything wrong with Mom?
Don't worry.
I'll check up and call you right back.
I'll hang up now, stay there.
May I stay here until he calls back?
Stay as long as you like.
Satsuki!
No, this corn is for my mommy!
No, it's my mom's!
Listen, Mei.
Mom's not well, so she's not coming home this time.
No!
There's nothing we can do.
You don't want her to get worse, do you?
No!
It's just for a few more days.
No!
So you don't care if she dies?
No!
Stop being silly!
I'm going.
Let's go, Mei.
I hate you, Satsuki!
We should bring the washing in.
Don't worry too much, Satsuki.
Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.
Your dad said he'll stop by the hospital to check on her.
Besides, it's just a cold; she'll be back next week.
They said it was just a cold when she went into hospital.
But what if she dies!
Don't be silly, Satsuki.
Maybe Mom will...
Stop it.
Nobody would leave two pretty little girls like you.
There, there.
Don't cry.
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?
Mei!
Mei!
Mei!
Did she come back?
Wasn't she at the bus stop?
That's strange.
Where has she gone?
I was nasty to her, 'cause she was being silly...
Maybe she's heading for the hospital!
The hospital?
It would take a grown-up three hours!
I'll go look!
Kanta, hurry!
Tell your dad that Mei is missing!
Stupid Mei.
Always getting lost.
Mei!
Excuse me.
Have you seen a little girl pass by?
She's my sister.
No, I don't think so.
I'm sure I would've noticed.
Maybe she wasn't here.
Are you sure she came this way?
I don't know.
Mei!
Please, stop!
Idiot!
What are you doing?
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl?
Your little sister?
She's four.
I think she's heading to the hospital.
Did you see anyone?
No.
We just came from there, but we didn't see anyone.
Thanks anyway.
Where have you come from?
From Matsugo.
Matsugo?
Really?
Good luck.
Satsuki!
Kanta!
Find her?
No.
And you?
Dad and the others are looking for her.
I'll go to the hospital, you go back home.
I guess she got lost on the way to the hospital.
They found a sandal by the pond.
We're not sure if it's hers or not!
Did you find her?
Dear Lord, please protect her and...
It's too deep here, better search further away!
Hey, are there any poles left?
Grandma, Satsuki's here!
Nanny!
Look, is it hers?
No, it isn't.
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.
Nanny was jumping to conclusions.
It's not hers!
Where did she go then?
Let's start from scratch.
Hurry, before it gets dark.
I really appreciate your help, everyone.
It could've been any of us.
Someone should contact the police.
Please, help me, Totoro!
Mei is lost.
It'll be dark soon.
I'm sure she's scared somewhere.
Totoro!
Mei is lost and we can't find her!
She must be scared, please help me find her.
I don't know what to do.
They can't see the bus.
FOREST SWAMP CEMETERY SHRINE SANCTUARY LAKE MEI Mei!
The trees are moving out of the way!
MEI Mei!
Satsuki!
Satsuki!
Mei!
Mei!
Satsuki!
You silly girl.
I'm sorry.
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?
SHICHIKOKUYAMA HOSPITAL Will you take us there?
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry.
They didn't need to send a telegram just for a cold.
The girls must be worried.
I'm sorry to upset them.
They'll be fine.
As long as you're okay.
We've all learned to cope.
This will just postpone the enjoyment.
They've put up with it so well.
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki, she's so sensitive.
You're right.
I'm going to spoil them for a while when I come home.
Oh, no!
She's laughing!
Looks like she's fine.
I can't wait to get back on my feet.
Me too!
Look.
Where did that come from?
What?
I could swear I just saw Satsuki and Mei laughing up in that tree.
Maybe they were.
Look.
TO MOM THE END
Oh, I come from a land From a faraway place Where the caravan camels roam Where it's flat and immense And the heat is intense It's barbaric but hey, it's home When the wind's from the east And the sun's from the west And the sand in the glass is right Come on down, stop on by Hop a carpet and fly To another Arabian night Arabian nights Like Arabian days More often than not Are hotter than hot In a lot of good ways Arabian nights 'Neath Arabian moons A fool off his guard Could fall and fall hard Out there on the dunes Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend.
Please, please, come closer.
T oo close.
A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this side of the river Jordan, on sale today.
Look at this.
Yes.
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break.
Will not...
It broke.
Ohh!
Look at this.
I have never seen one of these intact before.
This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware.
Listen.
Ah, still good.
Wait.
Don't go.
I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare.
I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this.
Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance.
Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts.
This is no ordinary lamp.
It once changed the course of a young man's life.
A young man who, like this lamp, was more than what he seemed.
The diamond in the rough.
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
It begins on a dark night... where a dark man waits with a dark purpose.
You are late.
A thousand apologies, O Patient One.
You have it then?
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.
Ah-ah-ahhh.
The treasure.
Ow!
Trust me, my pungent friend.
You'll get what's coming to you.
What's coming to you.
Awk!
Quickly!
Follow the trail.
Faster.
At last, after all my years of searching... the Cave of Wonders.
Awk.
Cave of Wonders.
By Allah.
Now, remember.
Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine.
Awk, the lamp.
Awk, the lamp.
Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?
Shh.
Who disturbs my slumber?
It is l, Gazeem, a humble thief.
Know this.
Only one may enter here, one whose worth lies far within.
A diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for#Go on.
No!
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp.
Just forget it.
Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm molting.
Patience, lago.
Patience.
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
Oh, there's a big surprise.
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise.
What are we gonna do?
We got a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one may enter.
I must find this one, this... diamond in the rough.
Stop!
Thief!
Stop!
Thief!
I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat.
All this for a loaf of bread?
Whoa!
There he is!
You won't get away so easy!
You think that was easy?
You two, over that way, and you, follow me.
We'll find him.
Morning, ladies.
Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?
Trouble.
No way.
You're only in trouble if you get caught.
Gotcha.
I'm in trouble.
And this time...
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.
Abu.
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Gotta keep one jump Ahead of the bread line One swing ahead of the sword I steal only what I can't afford That's everything.
One jump ahead of the lawmen That's all and that's no joke These guys don't appreciate I'm broke Riffraff.
Street rat.
Scoundrel.
Take that.
Just a little snack, guys Rip him open Take it back, guys I can take a hint Gotta face the facts You're my only friend, Abu Who?
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom He's become a one-man rise in crime I'd blame parents Except he hasn't got 'em Gotta eat to live Gotta steal to eat Tell you all about it When I got the time One jump ahead of the slowpokes One skip ahead of my doom Next time gonna use a nom de plume There he is.
One jump ahead of the hit men One hit ahead of the flock I think I'll take a stroll Around the block Stop, thief.
Vandal.
Abu!
Scandal.
Let's not be too hasty Still I think he's rather tasty Gotta eat to live Gotta steal to eat Otherwise we'd get along Wrong.
Get him!
He's got a sword!
You idiots.
We've all got swords.
One jump ahead of the hoofbeats Vandal!
One hop ahead of the hump Street rat!
One trick ahead of disaster Scoundrel!
They're quick, but I'm much faster Here goes, better throw my hand in Wish me happy landin' All I gotta do is jump Yuck!
Oy!
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.
All right.
Yum, yum!
Uh-oh.
Here.
Go on.
Take it.
Ah, don't.
Huh?
On his way to the palace, I suppose.
Another suitor for the princess.
Out of my way, you filthy brats.
Hey!
If I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners.
Oh.
I'll teach you some manners.
Look at that, Abu.
It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends.
Ooh!
You are a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you.
I'm not worthless.
And I don't have fleas.
Come on, Abu.
Let's go home.
Riffraff, street rat I don't buy that If only they'd look closer Would they see a poor boy No, siree They'd find out There's so much more To me Some day, Abu, things are gonna change.
We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all.
I've never been so insulted.
Oh, Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?
Good luck marrying her off.
Oh!
Jasmine.
Jasmine!
Jasmine!
Jasmine!
Confound it, Rajah.
So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out.
Oh, Father.
Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?
You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you?
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call.
The law says you must be married to a prince... by your next birthday.
The law is wrong.
You've only got three more days.
Father, I hate being forced into this.
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.
Jasmine... it's not only this law.
I'm not going to be around forever, and, well, l...
I just want to make sure you're taken care of.
Provided for.
Please try to understand.
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.
Except you, Rajah.
I've never even been outside the palace walls.
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.
Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore.
Oooh!
I...
I...
Allah forbid you should have any daughters.
Hmm?
I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Oh!
Ah, Jafar.
My most trusted advisor.
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.
My life is but to serve you, my lord.
It's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.
I'm at my wit's end.
Awk!
Wit's end!
Oh!
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
Now, then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem.
If anyone can help, it's you.
But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.
Oh.
Uh, my ring?
But it's been in the family for years.
It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be... fine.
The diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Whatever you need will be fine.
You are most gracious, my liege.
Now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm?
Yes.
That will be pretty good.
I can't take it anymore!
If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...
Bam!
Whack!
Calm yourself, lago.
Then I'd grab him around the head.
Whack!
Soon I will be sultan, not that addle-pated twit.
And then I stuff the crackers down his throat.
Ha, ha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.
I'll miss you.
Goodbye.
Okay, Abu.
Go.
Try this.
Your taste buds will dance and sing.
Get your paws off that.
Why, you...
Get away from here, you cursed, filthy ape!
Goodbye.
Nice going, Abu.
Breakfast is served.
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.
Sugar dates.
Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.
Fresh fish!
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
Oh, no.
I don't think so.
Oh!
Excuse me.
I'm really very sorry.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
Hello.
Hello?
Oh, you must be hungry.
Here you go.
You'd better be able to pay for that.
Pay?
No one steals from my cart.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.
Thief!
Please...
If you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan.
Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
No!
No, please!
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.
I've been looking all over for you.
What are you doing?
Just play along.
You, uh, know this girl?
Sadly, yes.
She is my sister.
She's a little crazy.
She said she knew the Sultan.
She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?
Tragic, isn't it?
But no harm done.
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.
Oh, hello, Doctor.
How are you?
No, no, no.
Not that one.
Come on, Sultan.
Huh.
What?
Come back here, you little thieves!
With all due respect, Your Rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
Save your breath, lago.
Faster.
Yes, O mighty Evil One.
Part, sands of time.
Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave.
Yes!
Yes!
There he is.
My diamond in the rough.
That's him.
That's the clown we've been waitin' for?
Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?
Swell.
Almost there.
I want to thank you for stopping that man.
Uh, forget it.
So, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?
Is it that obvious?
Well, you do kind of stand out.
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.
Hmm.
I'm a fast learner.
Wow.
Hey.
Come on.
This way.
Whoa.
Watch your head there.
Be careful.
Is this where you live?
Yep.
Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.
That sounds fabulous.
Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view.
Wow.
The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
Oh, it's wonderful.
I wonder what it would be like to live there, and have servants and valets.
Oh, sure.
People who tell you where to go and how to dress.
It's better than here.
You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards.
You're not free to make your own choices.
Sometimes you feel so...
You're just... ...trapped.
So, where are you from?
What does it matter?
I ran away and I am not going back.
Really.
How come?
Why, you...
My father's forcing me to get married.
That's... that's awful.
Abu!
What?
Abu says, uh... that's not fair.
What?
Oh, did he?
Yeah, of course.
And does Abu have anything else to say?
Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help.
Oh, boy.
Hmm.
Tell him that's very sweet.
Here you are.
They're after me!
You?
My father must have sent them...
Do you trust me?
What?
Do you trust me?
Yes...
Then jump!
We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat?
Run!
Go!
Get out of here!
Get this thing off of me!
It's the dungeon for you, boy.
Get off of me.
Let him go.
Looky here, men.
A street mouse.
Unhand him, by order of the princess.
Princess Jasmine.
The princess?
Princess?
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.
That's not your concern.
Do as I command.
Release him.
I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar.
You'll have to take it up with him.
Believe me, I will.
Jafar?
Oh, Princess.
Awk!
Jafar, I'm stuck.
How may I be of service to you?
The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.
Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah.
The boy was a criminal.
What was his crime?
I can't breathe, Jafar.
Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
If you could just...
Aah!
That hurt!
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.
Oh, dear.
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...
What do you mean?
Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.
What sentence?
Death.
By beheading.
No.
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.
How could you?
So, how did it go?
I think she took it... rather well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
I didn't even know his name.
She was the princess.
I can't believe it.
I must have sounded so stupid to her.
Yoo-hoo!
Aladdin!
Hello!
Abu.
Down here.
Come on, help me out of these.
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry.
I'll never see her again.
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.
She's gotta marry a prince.
She deserves a prince.
Ta-da!
I'm a fool.
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.
Who are you?
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.
But together, perhaps we can be more.
I'm listening.
There is a cave, boy, a Cave of Wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
Ooh!
Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager.
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.
But the law says only a prince can...
You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you?
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.
Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?
I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.
Uh, one problem.
It's out there.
We're in here.
Uh-uh.
Things aren't always what they seem.
So... do we have a deal?
Oh, I don't know.
Who disturbs my slumber?
Uh, it is l, Aladdin.
Proceed.
Touch nothing but the lamp.
Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and then you shall have your reward.
Come on, Abu.
Would you look at that!
Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the Sultan.
Abu!
Don't... touch... anything.
We gotta find that lamp.
Huh?
Aladdin!
Abu, will you knock it off?
Abu, what are you, crazy?
A magic carpet.
Come on.
Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.
Thanks.
Wait a minute.
Don't go.
Maybe you can help us.
Hey!
Whoa!
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.
I think he knows where it is.
Wait here.
Oh!
This is it?
This is what we came all the way down here to...
Abu!
No! lnfidels!
Uh-oh.
You have touched the forbidden treasure!
Now you will never again see the light of day!
Whoa!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Gotcha!
Carpet, let's move.
Abu!
Abu, this is no time to panic.
Start panicking.
Whoa!
Help me out.
Throw me the lamp.
I can't hold on.
Give me your hand.
First give me the lamp.
Yes!
At last!
What are you doing?
Giving you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
It's mine.
It's all mine.
I... where is it?
No.
No!
Jasmine?
Oh, dearest.
What's wrong?
Jafar has... done something terrible.
There, there, my dear.
We'll set it right.
Now, tell me everything.
Oh.
Aladdin.
Wake up.
Aladdin.
Oh!
My head.
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal!
Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.
Aha!
Why, you hairy little thief.
Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.
Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out.
Aaaaahhhhh!
Oy! 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck.
Hang on a second.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Does it feel good to be outta there.
Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.
Hi.
Where you from?
What's your name?
Uh...
Uh, Aladdin.
Aladdin.
Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you "Al"?
Or maybe just "Din." How about "Laddie"?
Sounds like, "Here, boy.
C'mon, Laddie." I must have hit my head harder than I thought.
Do you smoke?
Mind if I do?
Oh, sorry, Cheetah.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.
Yo, Rugman.
Haven't seen you in a few millennia.
Give me some tass-el.
Yeah.
Yo, yo.
Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master.
That or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look from the side.
Do I look different?
Wait a minute.
I'm your master?
That's right.
He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?
The ever impressive, the long contained, often imitated, but never duplicated...
Duplicated, duplicated...
Genie... of the Lamp!
Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your very much wish fulfillment.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Wish fulfillment?
Three wishes to be exact.
And ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes.
That's it.
Three.
Uno, dos, tres.
No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.
Now I know I'm dreaming.
Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here.
So why don't you just ruminate whilst I illuminate the possibilities.
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves Scheherazade had a thousand tales But, master, you're in luck 'Cause up your sleeves You got a brand of magic never fails You got some power in your corner now Some heavy ammunition in your camp You got some punch pizzazz Yahoo and how See, all you gotta do Is rub that lamp and I'll say Mr.
Aladdin, sir, What will your pleasure be Let me take your order Jot it down You ain't never had a friend like me Life is your restaurant And I'm your maitre d' Come on, whisper what it is you want You ain't never had a friend like me Yes, sir We pride ourselves on service You're the boss, the king, the shah Say what you wish It's yours, true dish How 'bout a little more baklava ?
Have some of column A Try all of column B I'm in the mood to help you, dude You ain't never had a friend like me Can your friends do this ?
Can your friends do that ?
Can your friends pull this Out their little hat ?
Can your friends go poof ?
Hey, looky here.
Ha ha!
Can your friends go Abracadabra, let her rip And then make the sucker disappear So don't you sit there Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed I'm here to answer All your midnight prayers You got me bona fide certified You got a genie For your charge d'affaires I got a powerful urge to help you out So what's your wish I really wanna know You got a list That's three miles long, no doubt All you gotta do is rub like so Mr.
Aladdin, sir Have a wish or two or three I'm on the job, you big nabob You ain't never had a friend Never had a friend You ain't never had a friend Never had a friend You ain't never Had a Friend Like Me You ain't never had a friend like me Huh?
So, what'll it be, Master?
You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want, right?
Ah, almost.
There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos.
Like?
Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody.
So don't ask.
Rule number two.
I can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else.
You little punim there.
Rule number three.
I can't bring people back from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.
Other than that, you got it.
Hmm.
Oh!
Provisos?
You mean limitations?
On wishes?
Some all-powerful genie.
Can't even bring people back from the dead.
I don't know, Abu.
He probably can't even get us out of this cave.
Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out.
Excuse me?
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?
And you're walking out on me?
I don't think so, not right now.
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!
In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere.
Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet.
We're... outta here!
Jafar, this is an outrage.
If it weren't for all your years of loyal service...
From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded.
I assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again.
Jasmine...
Jafar.
Let's put this whole messy business behind us.
Please.
My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, Princess.
At least some good will come of my being forced to marry.
When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.
That's nice.
All settled, then.
Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business...
Jasmine?
Jasmine!
If only I had gotten that lamp. "l will have the power to get rid of you." To think we gotta keep kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives...
No, lago.
Only until she finds a chump husband.
Then she'll have us banished.
Or beheaded.
Oh.
Wait a minute.
Jafar.
What if you were the chump husband?
What?
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?
And, uh, then you become the sultan.
Oh.
Marry the shrew.
I become the sultan.
The idea has merit.
Yes, merit.
Yes.
And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff.
Yaaah!
Kersplat!
I love the way your foul little mind works.
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs.
Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop.
Thank you.
Goodbye now.
Good-ye.
Thank you.
Well, how about that, Mr.
Doubting Mustafa?
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.
Dost mine ears deceive me?
Three.
You are down by one, boy.
Ah, no.
I never actually wished to get out of the cave.
You did that on your own.
Well, I feel sheepish.
All right, you baaad boy, but no more freebies.
Fair deal.
So, three wishes.
I want them to be good.
What would you wish for?
Me?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well, in my case...
Ah, forget it.
What?
No, I can't.
I...
Come on.
Tell me.
Freedom.
You're a prisoner?
It's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
Itty bitty living space.
Genie, that's terrible.
But, oh, to be free.
Not have to go, "Poof.
What do you need?
Poof.
What do you need?
Poof.
What do you need?" To be my own master.
Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world.
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.
Why not?
The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.
So you can guess how often that's happened.
I'll do it.
I'll set you free.
Uh-huh, yeah, right.
No, really, I promise. after I make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free.
Well, here's hopin'.
All right.
Let's make some magic.
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?
Well, there's this girl.
Wrong.
I can't make anybody fall in love, remember?
Oh, but, Genie, she's smart and fun and...
Pretty?
Beautiful.
She's got these eyes that just... and this hair.
Wow.
And her smile...
Ami.
C'est l'amour.
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance, I'd have to be...
Hey, can you make me a prince?
Let's see here.
Chicken à la king?
Nope.
Alaskan king crab.
Ow.
I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad.
Ah!
Et tu, Brute.
No.
Aha. "To make a prince." Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.
Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince.
All right!
Yo, yo!
Woof!
Woof!
First, that fez-and-vest combo is much too third century.
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?
No.
Let's work with me here.
Ooh.
I like it.
Muy macho.
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?
It says mode of transportation.
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aqui.
Over here.
Uh-oh.
Here he comes.
What better way to make your entrance on the streets of Agrabah than riding your very own brand-new camel.
Watch out.
They spit.
Mmm.
Not enough.
Still not enough.
Let's see.
What do you need?
Yes!
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo !
Whoa!
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.
Abu, you look good.
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.
But we're not through yet.
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.
Sire, I've found a solution to the problem with your daughter.
Awk.
The problem with your daughter.
Oh, really?
Right here. "lf the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her." But Jasmine hated all those suitors.
How could I choose someone she hates?
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more. "lf in the event a suitable prince cannot be found," Jerk. "a princess must then be wed to..." Hmm.
Interesting.
What?
Who?
The royal vizier.
Why, that would be... me.
But I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess.
I'm quite sure that...
Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.
Yes.
Desperate measures.
You will order the princess to marry me.
I will order... the princess... to...
But you're so old.
The princess will marry me.
The princess will marry...
What.
What is that?
That music.
Jafar, you must come and see this.
Make way for Prince Ali Say hey It's Prince Ali Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar Hey you, let us through It's a bright new star Oh come, be the first on your block To meet his eye Make way, here he comes Ring bells, bang the drums You're gonna love this guy Prince Ali, fabulous he Ali Ababwa Genuflect, show some respect Down on one knee Now, try your best to stay calm Brush up your Sunday salaam Then come and meet His spectacular coterie Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa Strong as ten regular men definitely He faced the galloping hordes A hundred bad guys with swords Who sent those goons to their lords Why, Prince Ali He's got 75 golden camels Don't they look lovely, June?

I love the feathers.
When it comes to exotic-type mammals Has he got a zoo I'm telling you It's a world-class menagerie Prince Ali, handsome is he, Ali Ababwa <font color=#FF8080>There's no question this Ali's alluring</font> That physique, how can I speak, weak at the knee <font color=#FF8080>Never ordinary, never boring Everything about the man just plain impresses</font> Well, get on out in that square <font color=#FF8080>He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder</font> Adjust your veil and prepare <font color=#FF8080>He's about to pull my heart asunder</font> To gawk and grovel and stare At Prince Ali <font color=#FF8080>And I absolutely love the way he dresses !</font> - He's got 95 white Persian monkeys He's got the monkeys - Let's see the monkeys And to view them he charges no fee He's got slaves He's got servants and flunkies Proud to work for him They bow to his whim, love serving him They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali Prince Ali Prince Ali, Amorous he Ali Ababwa Heard your princess Was a sight lovely to see And that, good people, is why He got dolled up and dropped by With 60 elephants, llamas galore With bears and lions, A brass band and more With his 40 fakirs, His cooks, his bakers His birds that warble on key Make way For Prince Ali Splendid.
Absolutely marvelous.
Your Majesty, I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Of course.
I'm delighted to meet you.
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.
Ecstatic.
I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
Ababwa.
Whatever.
You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to...
By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.
Ooh.
I don't suppose I might...
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.
Sire, I must advise against this.
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.
Ow, ow, ow.
Ahh!
Whoa!
Just where did you say you were from?
Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure.
Try me.
Look out, Polly.
Hey, watch it.
Watch it with the dumb rug.
Aah!
Whew!
Out of the way.
I'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.
Spectacular, Your Highness.
That was lovely.
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.
If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.
I don't trust him, Sire.
Nonsense.
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar, I'm an excellent judge of character.
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure.
Not!
Jasmine will like this one.
And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.
This boy is no different from the others.
What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?
Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa.
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.
How dare you.
All of you.
Standing around deciding my future?
I am not a prize to be won.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.
I think it's time to say good-bye to Prince Abooboo.
What am I gonna do?
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.
I should've known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.
So move.
Hey.
That's a good move.
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.
Genie, I need help.
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.
If you wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter.
Do you got it?
What?
Tell her the... ... truth!
No way.
If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.
A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh.
Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.
I just...
I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.
How do I look?
Like a prince.
Princess Jasmine?
Who's there?
It's me, Prince Ali.
Ahem.
Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.
I do not want to see you.
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.
Just leave me alone.
Down, kitty.
So, how's our little beau doing?
Good kitty, take off.
Down, kitty.
Wait.
Wait.
Do I know you?
Uh, no.
No.
You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace.
The marketplace?
I have servants who go to the marketplace for me.
Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants.
It couldn't have been me you met.
No.
I guess not.
Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.
Anything.
Pick a feature.
Ahem.
Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...
Wonderful, magnificent, punctual. ... punctual.
Punctual?
Sorry.
Uh, beautiful.
Nice recovery.
Hmm.
I'm rich, too, you know.
Yeah.
The daughter of a sultan.
I know.
A fine prize for any prince to marry.
Uh, right.
Right.
A prince like me.
Warning!
Warning!
Right.
A prince like you.
And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering peacock I've met.
Mayday!
Mayday!
Just go jump off a balcony!
What?
Stop her.
Stop her!
Want me to sting her?
Buzz off.
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.
Yeah, right.
What?
Uh...
Uh, you're right.
You aren't just some prize to be won.
You should be free to make your own choice.
I'll go now.
No!
What?
What?
How...
How are you doing that?
It's a magic carpet.
It's lovely.
You, uh...
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace, see the world.
Is it safe?
Sure.
Do you trust me?
What?
Do you trust me?
Yes.
Yes.
I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid Tell me, Princess Now, when did you last Let your heart decide I can open your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways and under On a magic carpet ride A whole new world A new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no Or where to go Or say we're only dreaming A whole new world A dazzling place I never knew But when I'm way up here It's crystal clear That now I'm in A whole new world with you Now I'm in A whole new world with you Unbelievable sights Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an endless diamond sky - A whole new world Don't you dare close your eyes - A hundred thousand things to see Hold your breath, it gets better I'm like a shooting star I've come so far I can't go back to where I used to be - A whole new world Every turn a surprise - With new horizons to pursue Every moment, red-letter I'll chase them anywhere There's time to spare Let me share This whole new world with you - A whole new world A whole new world That's where we'll be That's where we'll be - A thrilling chase A wondrous place For you and me It's all so magical.
Yeah.
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
Nah.
He hates fireworks.
He doesn't like flying, either.
Uh, that is, um...
Oh, no.
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.
Why did you lie?
Jasmine, I'm sorry.
Did you think I was stupid?
No.
That I wouldn't figure it out?
No.
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.
Who are you?
Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The truth.
Um...
The truth is...
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um... to escape the pressures of palace life.
But I really am a prince.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Well, you know... royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think?
Hmm.
Not that strange.
Good night, my handsome prince.
Sleep well, Princess.
Yes!
For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right.
Abu.
Abu.
Hold him.
I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo.
Why, you...
Make sure he's never found.
Never fails.
Get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp.
Hello?
Al?
Al!
Kid, snap out of it.
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.
You have to say, "Genie, I want you to save my life." Got it?
Come on, Aladdin!
I'll take that as a yes.
Up scope.
Don't you scare me like that.
Genie, l, uh...
I...
Thanks, Genie.
Oh, Al.
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.
Not that I wanna pick out curtains or anything.
Jasmine.
Oh, Father, I just had the most wonderful time.
I'm so happy.
You should be, Jasmine.
I have chosen a husband for you.
What?
You will wed Jafar.
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.
I will never marry you.
Father, I choose Prince Ali.
Prince Ali left.
Better check your crystal ball again, Jafar.
Prince Ali!
How in the... uh.
Awk!
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.
What?
Ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness.
He is obviously lying.
Obviously lying.
Father, what's wrong with you?
I know what's wrong.
Oh, my!
Jafar's been controlling you with this.
What?
Jafar?
You, you traitor!
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
Guards!
Guards!
Well, that's it.
We're dead.
Forget it.
Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.
Arrest Jafar at once.
This is not done yet, boy.
Find him!
Search everywhere!
Jasmine, are you all right?
Yes.
Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time.
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will I ever...
Huh?
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?
Ha, ha!
Praise Allah!
You brilliant boy, I could kiss you.
I won't.
I'll leave that to my...
But you two will be wed at once.
Yes, yes.
And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then you, my boy, will become sultan.
Sultan?
Yes.
A fine upstanding youth such as yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs.
We gotta get outta here.
I gotta start packing.
Only essentials.
We gotta travel light.
Bring the guns, the weapons, and how about this picture?
I think I'm making a weird face in it.
Oh, boy.
He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.
Jafar!
Jafar!
Get a grip!
Good grip.
Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin, Aladdin.
He has the lamp, lago.
Why, that miserable...
But you are going to relieve him of it.
Me?
Sultan?
They want me to be Sultan?
Huzzah! #Hail the conquering hero# Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess.
What are you gonna do next?
Psst.
Your line is, "I'm going to free the genie." Anytime.
Genie.
I can't.
Sure you can.
You just go, "Genie, I wish you free." I'm serious.
Look, I'm sorry.
I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.
No.
They wanna make Prince Ali sultan.
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
Al, you won.
Because of you.
The only reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you.
What if they find out I'm not really a prince?
What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.
Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.
I can't wish you free.
Fine.
I understand.
You've lied to everyone else.
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Master.
Genie, I'm really sorry.
Well, fine.
Then just stay in there.
What are you guys looking at?
Look, l...
I'm sorry.
Abu, I'm sorry.
I didn't...
Wait.
Come on.
What am I doing?
Genie's right.
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.
Ali.
Oh, Ali.
Will you come here?
Well, here goes.
Jasmine?
Where are you?
Out in the menagerie.
Hurry.
I'm coming.
You got a problem, Pinky?
Jerk.
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.
Excellent work, lago.
Ah, go on.
No, really.
On a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven.
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.
I'm embarrassed.
I'm blushing.
People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor.
Jasmine.
Ali, where have you been?
Jasmine, there's something I got to tell you.
The whole kingdom's turned out for Father's announcement.
No.
But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.
You don't understand...
Good luck. ...Ali Ababwa!
Oh, boy.
Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
Let them cheer.
Let them cheer.
You know, Al, I'm getting really...
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.
I am your master now.
I was afraid of that.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
I wish to rule on high as sultan.
Whoa!
Bless my soul.
What is this?
What's going on?
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?
Father.
Jafar, you vile betrayer.
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
Oh, yeah?
We'll just see about that.
The lamp.
Finders keepers, Abooboo.
Genie, no!
Sorry, kid.
I got a new master now.
Jafar, I order you to stop.
Ah, but there's a new order now.
My order.
Finally, you will bow to me.
We will never bow to you.
Why am I not surprised?
If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer!
Genie, my second wish...
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!
Genie, stop!
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar!
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes.
Abject humiliation.
Down, boy.
Oh, Princess.
There's someone I'm dying to introduce you to.
Jafar.
Get your hands off her.
Prince Ali Yes, it is he But not as you know him Read my lips And come to grips with reality Yes, meet a blast from your past Whose lies were too good to last Say hello To your precious Prince Ali Or should we say Aladdin?
Ali?
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I'm just...
So Ali turns out to be Merely Aladdin Just a con, need I go on Take it from me His personality flaws Give me adequate cause To send him packing On a one-way trip So his prospects Take a terminal dip His assets frozen, the venue chosen Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!
So long!
Good-bye, see ya.
Ex-Prince Ali Abu.
Abu!
Oh, this is all my fault.
I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.
Abu.
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry, Abu.
I made a mess of everything.
Somehow...
I gotta go back and set things right.
Carpet.
Abu, start digging.
That's it.
Yeah!
All right!
Now, back to Agrabah.
Let's go.
Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here's your cracker.
Shoved all the way down your throat.
Here.
Have lots.
Stop it.
Jafar, leave him alone.
It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.
A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
What do you say, my dear?
Why, with you as my queen...
Never.
I'll teach you some respect.
No.
Genie.
I have decided to make my final wish.
I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me.
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo...
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout.
You will do what I order you to do, slave.
Jafar.
I never realized how... incredibly handsome you are.
Mmm.
That's better.
Now, pussycat... tell me more about myself.
You're tall... dark... well dressed...
Al.
Al, little buddy.
Shh.
Al, I can't help you.
I work for Seor Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise. ...cute little gaps between your teeth.
Go on.
And your beard... is so... twisted.
You've stolen my heart.
Jaf...!
And the street rat?
What street rat?
Yech!
That was...
You!
How many times do I have to kill you, boy?
Get the lamp.
No!
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.
Jasmine.
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...
Don't toy with me.
Abu!
Things are unraveling fast now, boy.
Get the point?
I'm just getting warmed up.
Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?
A snake, am l?
Perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike I can be. #Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake Stick that sword into that snake# You stay out of this.
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... great!
Aladdin.
Jasmine, hang on.
You little fool.
You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth.
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a...
Awk!
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.
The genie.
The genie.
The genie has more power than you'll ever have.
What?
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.
But not for long.
The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.
One too many hits with the snake.
Slave, I make my third wish.
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.
Yes.
Yes!
The power.
The absolute power!
What have you done?
Trust me.
The universe is mine to command, to control!
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Huh?
You wanted to be a genie... you got it.
What?
And everything that goes with it.
No!
No!
I'm gettin' out of here.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
You're the genie.
I don't want...
Itty bitty living space.
Al, you little genius, you.
Ahh!
Get your blasted beak out of my face.
Oh, shut up, you moron.
Don't tell me to shut up.
Allow me. 10,000 years in a Cave of Wonders ought to chill him out.
Shut up!
Jasmine...
I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince.
I know why you did.
Well, I guess... this is good-bye?
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.
I love you.
Al, no problem.
You've still got one wish left.
Just say the word and you're a prince again.
But, Genie, what about your freedom?
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.
This is love.
Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.
Believe me, I know.
I've looked.
Jasmine, I do love you, but I got to stop pretending to be something I'm not.
I understand.
Genie, I wish for your freedom.
One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.
What?
Genie, you're free.
I'm free.
I'm free.
Quick.
Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.
Say, "l want the Nile." Try that.
Uh, I wish for the Nile.
No way!
Oh, does that feel good!
Oh!
I'm free!
I'm free at last!
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world.
I'm...
Genie, I'm...
I'm gonna miss you.
Me, too, Al.
No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me.
That's right.
You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned.
It's that law that's the problem.
Father?
Well, am I Sultan or am I Sultan?
From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy.
Him.
I choose...
I choose you, Aladdin.
Call me Al.
Oh, all of ya, come over here.
Big group hug.
Group hug.
Mind if I kiss the monkey?
Ooh, hairball.
Well, I can't do any more damage around this Popsicle stand.
I'm outta here!
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hey, Rugman, ciao.
I'm history.
No, I'm mythology.
I don't care what I am.
I'm free! #A whole new world# #A whole new life# #For you and me# #A whole new world #?
Made you look. 00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00 <font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.moviesubtitles.org</font>

I brought my attack dog with the built-in force field.
Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs.
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!

Ages 3 and up.

Ages 3 and up.
I'm not supposed to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.
Hey, Hamm.

You uncultured swine!
What're you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?
Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?

Okay.

At ease.
Hey, uh, Slinky?
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.
No.
Slink...
Oh, well, all right.
You can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink.
I got some bad news.
Bad news?
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting, and be happy.
Got it.
Be happy!
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium duty.
Hey.
Hey, Etch.
Draw!
Oh!
Got me again.
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.
Now, where is that...
Oh.
Hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here?
How're you doin', Rex?
Were you scared?
Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it.
I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
Oh, hi, Bo.
Hi.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.
What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Oh, yeah!
Remember, I'm just a couple of blocks away.
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
Come on, come on.
Smaller toys up front.
Hey, Woody, come on.
Oh, thanks, Mike.
Okay...
Whoa, whoa.
Step back.
For crying out loud.
Thank you.
Hello?
Check.
That better?
Great.
Everybody hear me?
Up on the shelf, can you hear me?
Great.
Okay.
First item today...
Oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?
What?
Moving buddy?
You can't be serious.
I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.
Do we have to hold hands?
You guys think this is a big joke.
We've only got one week left before the move.
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.
If you don't have one, get one!
All right, next.
Oh, yes.
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion awareness meeting was, I think, a big success.
And we wanna thank Mr Spell for putting that on for us.
Thank you, Mr Spell.
You're welcome.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
One minor note here.
Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.
Wait a minute here!
What do you mean the party?'s today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party? before the move.
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried.
He's been Andy's favourite since kindergarten.
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.
If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me.
Woody has never steered us wrong before.
Come on, guys.
Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
But what ifAndy gets another dinosaur, a mean one?
I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.
This is Andy we're talking about.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.
What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.
That's what we're made for, right?
Pardon me.
I hate to break up the staff meeting, but... they're here!
Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Stay calm, everyone!
Hey!
Meeting adjourned.
Ho, boy!
Will you take a look at all those presents?
I can't see a thing.
Yes, sir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.
Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
Oh, for crying out loud.
They're all in boxes, you idiot.
They're getting bigger.
Wait, there's a nice little one over there.
Hi!
Spell, trash can.
We're doomed!
All right!
All right!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Yes!
Yes!
We promise!
Okay!
Save your batteries.
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.
Sergeant, establish a recon post downstairs.
Code Red!
You know what to do.
Yes, sir!
All right, men.
You heard him.
Code Red!
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie.
Execute!
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!
Yeah!
Okay, come on, kids.
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.
All right, gangway, gangway.
And this is how we find out what is in those presents.
Okay, who's hungry?
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch and barbecue!
What in the world...
Oh!
I thought I told him to pick these up.
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.
Go on without me!
Just go!
A good soldier never leaves a man behind.
Okay, everybody, come on.
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids.
Everybody...
You sit in a circle.
No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.
Good.
And...
Which present are you gonna open first?
Mine!
There they are.
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.
This is it!
This is it!
Quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird.
All right, Andy's opening the first present now.
Mrs Potato Head!
Mrs Potato Head!
Mrs Potato Head!
Hey, I can dream, can't I?
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.
It's a...
It's...
It's a... a lunch box.
We've got a lunch box here.
A lunch box?
Lunch box?
For lunch.
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...
Okay, it's bed sheets.
Who invited that kid?
Oh!
Only one left.
Okay, we're on the last present now.
Last present!
It's a big one.
It's a... lt's a board game!
Repeat, Battleship!
Whew!
Hallelujah!
Yeah!
All right!
Hey, watch it!
Sorry there, old spud head.
Mission accomplished.
Well done, men.
Pack it up.
We're goin' home.
So did I tell ya?
Nothin' to worry about.
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.
Wait a minute.
Oh!
What do we have here?
Wait!
Turn that thing back on!
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!
Mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet.
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.
Mom, what is it?
It's a huge package.
Oh, get outta the...
One of the kids is in the way.
I can't see.
It's a...
Wow!
It's a what?
What is it?
Oh, no!
Oh, ya big lizard!
Now we'll never know what it is!
Way to go, Rex!
No, no!
Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!
He's puttin' 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!
Let's go to my room, guys!
Red alert!
Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!
There!
Juvenile intrusion!
Repeat, resume your positions now!
Andy's coming!
Everybody, back to your places!
Hurry!
Get to your places!
Get to your places!
Where's my ear?
Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?
Out of my way!
Here I come!
Here I come!
Hey, look, its lasers light up.
Take that, Zurg!
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!
We've got prizes!
What is it?
Can you see it?
What the heck is up there?
Woody, who's up there with ya?
Woody?
What are you doing under the bed?
Nothin'.
Nothin'.
I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.
Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.
It's just a mistake!
Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Have you been replaced?
What did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice, big Andy's-room welcome.
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
Come in, Star Command.
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?
Why don't they answer?
My ship!
Blast!
This'll take weeks to repair.
Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4-0-7-2.
My ship has run off course en route to sector 1 2.
I've crash-landed on a strange planet.
The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep.
Terrain seems a bit unstable.
No readout yet if the air is breathable.
And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.
Hello!
Whoa!
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Did I frighten you?
Didn't mean to.
Sorry.
Howdy.
My name is Woody.
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.
And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up.
This is my spot, see, the bed here.
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit.
My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
Yes, it is a mistake because, you see, the bed here is my spot.
I need to repair my turbo boosters.
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or have you discovered crystallic fusion?
Well, let's see.
We got double-A's.
Watch yourself!
Halt!
Who goes there?
Don't shoot!
It's okay.
Friends.
Do you know these life-forms?
Yes!
They're Andy's toys.
All right, everyone, you're clear to come up.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!
Wh-why, thank you!
Now, thank you all for your kind welcome!
Say, what's that button do?
I'll show you.
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.
Only it's...
Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.
Probably all copper wiring, huh?
So, where you from?
Singapore?
Hong Kong?
Well, no.
Actually, I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.
As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.
I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout.
You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before.
Well, sure.
Look at him.
He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.
Please be careful.
You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
Hey, a laser!
How come you don't have a laser, Woody?
It's not a laser!
It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
What's with him?
Laser envy.
All right, that's enough!
Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy.
Toy?
T-O-Y.
Toy!
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is "Space Ranger." The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present.
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?
Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious.
What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He's not a Space Ranger!
He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly!
Excuse me.
Oh, impressive wingspan!
Very good!
Oh, what?
What?
These are plastic.
He can't fly!
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I can fly.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
You can't.
Can.
Can't.
Can't.
Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it.
All right, then, I will.
Stand back, everyone!
To infinity and beyond!
Can!
Whoa!
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!
I found my movin' buddy.
Thank you.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.
Man, the dolls must really go for you.
Can you teach me that?
Golly bob howdy!
Oh, shut up!
You know, in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.
They'll see.
They'll see.
I'm still Andy's favourite toy.
I was on top of the world livin' high It was right in my pocket I was livin' the life Things were just the way they should be When from out of the sky like a bomb Comes some little punk in a rocket Now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to me Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
Strange Things are happening to me Strange Things Strange things are happening to me Ain't no doubt about it I had friends I had lots of friends Now all my friends are gone And I'm doin' the best I can To carry on I had power Power I was respected Respected But not any more And I've lost the love of the one Whom I adore Let me tell you 'bout it Strange Things are happenin' to me Strange Things Strange Things are happenin' to me Ain't no doubt about it Strange Things Strange Things Finally!
Hey, who's got my hat?
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!
Gimme that!
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog, let me show you something.
It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture.
Your chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me.
Wow!
With permanent ink too!
Well, I must get back to repairing my ship.
Don't let it get to you, Woody.
Let what?
I don't...
What do you mean?
Who?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz.
But you know he'll always have a special place for you.
Yeah, like the attic.
All right, that's it!
Unidirectional bonding strip.
Mr Lightyear wants more tape.
Listen, Light Snack, you stay away from Andy.
He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?
And another thing, stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!
Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Okay!
Well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?
Don't even think about it, cowboy.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?
The air isn't... toxic.
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!
My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
You actually think you're the Buzz Lightyear?
Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!
Where?
Yes!
It's Sid!
Don't move!
I thought he was at summer camp.
They must've kicked him out early this year.
Oh, no, not Sid!
Incoming!
Who is it this time?
I...
I can't...
I can't tell.
Hey, where's Lenny?
Right here, Woody.
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again.
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.
What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys.
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
That's why, Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellow.
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.
That is Sid.
You mean that happy child?
That ain't no happy child.
He tortures toys, just for fun!
Well, then we've got to do something.
What are you doing?
Get down from there!
I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
Yeah, sure.
You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it!
Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes!
He's gone!
He's history!
I could've stopped him.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.
Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater.
The sooner we move, the better.
Yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
All this packing makes me hungry.
What would you say to dinner at, oh, Pizza Planet?
Pizza Planet?
Oh, cool!
Go wash your hands, and I'll get Molly ready.
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring one toy.
Just one?
One toy?
Will Andy pick me? "Don't count on it"?
Buzz!
Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.
We've got trouble!
Trouble?
Where?
Down there.
Just down there.
A helpless toy, it's... it's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose.
I don't see anything!
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!
What kind of toy...
Buzz!
Buzz!
I don't see him in the driveway.
I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
Oh!
Buzz!
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to say something.
What is it, boy?
He's saying that this was no accident.
What do you mean?
I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...
No! ...by Woody!
What?
Wait a minute.
You don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you?
Potato Head?
That's Mr Potato Head to you, you back-stabbing murderer!
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?
Well, ye...
N...
I don't like confrontations!
Where is your honour, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!
You don't deserve to...
Hey!
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting in on your playtime, could you, Woody?
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favourite toy.
So you got rid of him.
Well, what ifAndy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?
You gonna knock me outta the window too?
I don't think we should give him the chance.
There he is, men.
Frag him!
Let's string him up by his pull string!
I got dibs on his hat!
Would you boys stop it!
Tackle him!
No, no, no!
Wait!
I can explain everything!
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.
Retreat!
Mom, do you know where Buzz is?
No, I haven't seen him.
Andy, I'm heading out the door!
But, Mom, I can't find him!
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!
Oh, okay.
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!
Buzz, the monkeys aren't working!
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!
Oh, where could he be?
Can I help pump the gas?
Sure!
I'll even let you drive.
Yeah?
Yeah, when you're 1 6.
Funny, Mom.
Great.
How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
Buzz!
Buzz!
Ha!
You're alive!
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved!
I'm saved.
Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake.
Huh?
Right?
Buddy?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh.
Well, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
No.
Okay, come on!
You want a piece of me?
Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
Next stop.
Pizza Planet!
Yeah!
Andy!
Wh...
Doesn't he realise that I'm not there?
I'm lost!
Oh, I'm a lost toy!
Buzz Lightyear mission log.
The local sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refuelling station of some sort.
You!
According to my navi-computer, the...
Shut up!
Just shut up, you idiot!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost.
Andy is gone.
They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault!
My...
My fault?
If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me...
Don't talk to me about importance!
Because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
What?
What are you talkin' about?
Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet!
I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.
And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!
You... are... a... toy!
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear!
You're a...
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity.
Farewell.
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony! "Rendezvous with Star Command." Hey, gas dude!
You talkin' to me?
Yeah, man.
Can you help me?
Pizza Planet?
Andy!
Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
Oh, no!
I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
Buzz!
Buzz, come back!
Go away!
No!
Buzz, you gotta come back!
I...
I found a spaceship!
It's a spaceship, Buzz!
Come on, man, hurry up!
Like, the pizzas are getting cold here!
Cutting Boulevard, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
Which way?
Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home.
Well, then, let's climb aboard.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz!
Buzz!
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.
Negative.
There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.
We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Yeah, bu...
Buzz!
Buzz!
That's two lefts and a right, huh?
Thanks for the directions, okay?
Yeah.
And remember, kid...
Buzz!
It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay.
What an idiot.
Next shuttle lift-off is scheduled for T-minus 30 minutes and counting.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
The white zone is for immediate pizza...
Sheriff!
There you are.
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.
Great idea, Woody.
I like your thinkin'.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
Now!
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.
Jones, party of five, your shuttle is now boarding...
Hey, Mom, can we have some tokens?
Watch where you're going!
Sorry. ...nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?
Andy!
Now, we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 1 2.
Wait a minute.
No, Buzz!
This way.
There's a special ship.
I just saw it.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyperactive hyperdrive.
And Astro... turf!
Where is it?
I don't see the...
Come on.
That's it.
Spaceship!
All right, Buzz, get ready.
And...
And the universe explodes!
Okay, Buzz, when I say go, we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!
No!
Mom, if I eat all my pizza, can I have some alien slime?
This cannot be happening to me.
A stranger.
From the outside.
Greetings.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
Before your space journey, re-energise yourself with a slice of pepperoni, now boarding at counter three.
This is an intergalactic emergency.
I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 1 2.
Who's in charge here?
The claw!
The claw is our master.
The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
This is ludicrous.
Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?
Take that!
Oh, no!
Sid!
Get down!
What's gotten into you?
I was...
You are the one that decided to climb into this...
The claw, it moves.
I have been chosen!
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.
Gotcha!
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!
Yes!
Buzz!
No!
Hey!
He has been chosen!
He must go.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Do not fight the claw.
Stop it!
Stop it, you zealots!
All right!
Double prizes!
Let's go home and... play.
Sheriff, I can see your dwelling from here.
You're almost home.
Nirvana is coming.
The mystic portal awaits.
Will you be quiet?
You guys don't get it, do you?
Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out.
Whoa, Scud!
Hey, boy!
Sit!
Good boy.
Hey, I got something for you, boy.
Freeze!
Ready, set, now!
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!
What?
Did I get my package in the mail?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
I don't know!
Oh, no, Hannah!
Look, Janie!
What?
Hey!
She's sick!
No, she's not!
I'll have to perform one of my operations.
No!
No, not Sid's room.
Not there.
Hey, give her back!
Sid!
Sid!
Oh, no, we have a sick patient here, nurse.
Prepare the OR, stat!
Patient is... prepped.
No one's ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before.
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!
I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.
Doctor, you've done it!
Hannah!
Janie's all better now.
Mom!
Mom!
She's lying!
Whatever she says, it's not true!
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!
Locked.
There's gotta be another way outta here.
Buzz?
Was that you?
Hey, hi there, little fella.
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?
Buzz!
They're cannibals.
Mayday, mayday.
Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.
Star Command, do you copy?
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Great.
Great.
Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.
Hey, you guys, I think I found him!
Buzz, is that you?
Whiskers, will you get outta here!
You're interfering with the search and rescue!
Look, they're home.
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.
Woody's gone?
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.
Huh?
Huh?
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?
Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!
I can see your will is strong.
Well, we have ways of making you talk.
Where are your rebel friends now?
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!
All right!
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.
A lesser man would've talked under such torture.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.
The door.
It's open!
We're free!
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
I'll tell you wha...
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!
Shield your eyes.
It's not working.
I recharged it before I left.
It should be good for...
You idiot!
You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!
Get away!
Hey!
Hey!
How're you doin' that?
Stop that.
Back!
Back, you savages!
Back!
Woody, stop it!
Sorry, guys, but dinner's cancelled!
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home.
Another stunt like that, cowboy, you're gonna get us killed.
Don't tell me what to do.
Yee-haw!
Giddyap, pardner!
We got to get this wagon train a-movin'!
Split up!
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.
This is Star Command.
Star Command!
Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
Buzz Lightyear responding.
Read you loud and clear.
Buzz Lightyear, planet Earth needs your help.
On the way!
Buzz Lightyear!
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!
Calling Buzz Lightyear!
Karate chop action!
Wow!
Pulsating laser light!
Total annihilation!
Multi-phrase voice simulator!
There's a secret mission in uncharted space.
There's a secret mission in uncharted space.
And best of all, high pressure space wings!
To infinity and beyond!
Not a flying toy.
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure and save a galaxy near you!
Buzz Lightyear!
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets in the tri-county area.

Clearly, I Will go sailing No more Mom!
Mom, have you seen my Sally doll?
What, dear?
What was that?
Never mind!
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?
There's a secret mission in uncharted space.
Let's go.
Really?
That is so interesting.
Would you like some tea, Mrs Nesbitt?
Buzz!
It's so nice you could join us on such late notice.
Oh, no!
What a lovely hat, Mrs Nesbitt.
It goes quite well with your head.
Hannah!
Oh, Hannah!
Mom?
Please excuse me, ladies.
I'll be right back.
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?
Buzz.
Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?
Gone!
It's all gone.
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye.
See ya.
What happened to you?
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy.
And suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darfeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sister.
I think you've had enough tea for today.
Let's get you outta here, Buzz.
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?
I am Mrs Nesbitt!
Snap out of it, Buzz!
I'm sorry.
I...
You're right.
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.
I can get through this.
Oh, I'm a sham!
Look at me.
Quiet, Buzz.
I can't even fly out of a window.
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.
The apron is a bit much. "Out the window"!
Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, come on.
This way.
Years of academy, training, wasted!
B-3.
Miss!
G-6.
You sunk it.
Are you peeking?
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.
Give me the nose.
Come on.
How about three out of five?
Hey, guys!
Guys!
Hey!
Son of a building block.
It's Woody.
He's in the psycho's bedroom.
Hi!
Everyone!
It's Woody!
Woody?
You're kidding!
Woody?
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz.
Buzz?
Hey, look!
Woody!
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you guys.
I knew you'd come back, Woody.
What are you doin' over there?
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.
Here!
Catch this!
Whoa!
I've got it, Woody.
He got it, Woody.
Good goin', Slink.
Nowjust, just tie it on to somethin'.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I got a better idea.
How 'bout we don't?
Hey!
Potato Head.
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?
Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?
And now you wanna let him back over here?
No!
No, no, no, no, no!
You got it...
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.
Buzz is fine.
Buzz is right here.
He's with me!
You are a liar!
No, I'm not.
Buzz, come over here.
Tell the nice toys that you're... that you're not dead.
Just a sec!
Buzz, will you get up here and give me a hand?
That's very funny, Buzz.
This is serious!
Hey, Woody!
Where'd ya go?
He's lying.
Buzz ain't there.
Oh!
Hi, Buzz!
Why don't you say hello to the guys over there?
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!
Hey, look!
It's Buzz!
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys our new secret best friends handshake.
Give me five, man!
Something's screwy here.
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?
You bet.
Give me a hug.
Boy, I love you too.
See?
It is Buzz.
Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Wait just a minute.
What are you tryin' to pull?
Nothing!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Murderer!
No!
No, no, no, no, no!
You murdering dog!
It's not what you think.
I swear!
Save it for the jury.
I hope Sid pulls your voice box out, ya creep.
No, no!
No, no!
Don't leave!
Don't leave!
Ya gotta help us, please!
You don't know what it's like over here!
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.
Come back!
Slink!
Slink!
Please!
Please!
Listen to me!
No!
No!
Come back!
Slinky!
Buzz!
Go away!
You disgusting freaks!
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!
He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters!
What are you doin'?
Hey.
Hey, they fixed you.
But they're cannibals.
We saw them eat those other toys.
Sorry.
I thought that you were gonna...
You know, you know, eat my friend.
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!
What's wrong?
Sid?
Not now, Mom!
I'm busy!
Sid!
Buzz, come on!
You left that door open.
Get up!
Use your legs!
Fine!
Let Sid trash you!
But don't blame me!
It came!
It finally came! "The Big One." "Extremely dangerous. "Keep out of reach of children." Cool!
What am I gonna blow?
Man.
Hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll?
Yes.
I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit.
Now.
Yes.
Oh, no!
Oh, man!
Sid Phillips reporting.
Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site.
Tomorrow's forecast, sunny.
Sweet dreams.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
But what if we leave them behind?
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
I need air!
Will you quit movin' around?
I'm sorry.
It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.
How did I get stuck with you as a moving buddy?
Everyone else was picked.
Oh, Woody.
If only you could see how much Andy misses you.
Hey, Buzz!
Hey.
Get over here and see if you can get this toolbox off me.
Oh, come on, Buzz, I...
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.
Then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?
Oh, Buzz.
You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody.
For the first time I am thinking clearly.
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.
I'm just a toy, a stupid, little, insignificant toy.
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.
Bein' a toy is a lot better than bein' a, a Space Ranger.
Yeah, right.
No, it is.
Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest.
And it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal.
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.
But why would Andy want me?
Why would Andy want you?
Look at you!
You're a Buzz Lightyear.
Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark.
You talk!
Your helmet does that, that, that whoosh thing.
You are a cool toy.
As a matter of fact, you're too cool.
I mean, I mean, what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?
All I can do is...
There's a snake in my boots.
Why would Andy ever want to play with me when he's got you?
I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.
You should get outta here while you can.
Buzz?
What are you doin'?
I thought you were...
Come on, Sheriff.
There's a kid over in that house who needs us.
Now let's get you out of this thing.
Yes, sir!
Come on, Buzz.
We can do it.
Woody, it's the moving van.
We gotta get outta here now.
Come on, Buzz.
All right.
Hey, I'm out!
Almost there.
I want to ride the pony.
Woody?
Woody?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
Oh, yeah!
Time for lift-off!
To infinity and beyond!
Back, back.
Down, down!
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody.
Think.
Guys!
No, no, no, no!
Wait!
Wait.
Listen, please.
There's a good toy down there, and he's gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes.
All because of me.
We gotta save him.
And...
But I need your help.
Please.
He's my friend.
And he's the only one I've got.
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.
We're gonna have to break a few rules.
But if it works, it'll help everybody.
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.
Launch pad is being constructed.
All right, listen up.
I need Pump Boy here, Ducky here.
Legs, you're with Ducky.
RollerBob and I don't move 'til we get the signal.
Clear?
Okay.
Let's move!
Wind the frog.
Wait for the signal.
Go!
All right, let's go!
I'll get it!
Now!
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Scud!
Stupid dog.
Lean back!
Mission Control, is the launch pad construction complete?
Roger.
Rocket is now secured to guide wire.
We are currently obtaining the ignition sticks.
Countdown will commence momentarily.
Stand by.
Let's go.
Hey, Ma!
Where are the matches?
Oh, wait.
Here they are.
Never mind.
Woody!
Great!
Help me outta this thing.
What?
It's okay.
Everything's under control.
Woody, what are you doing?
Houston.
All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...
Hey?
How'd you get out here?
Oh, well.
You and I can have a cookout later.
Houston, do we have permission to launch?
Roger.
Permission granted.
You are confirmed at "T" minus ten seconds.
And counting.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Reach for the sky!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us.
What?
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
It's busted.
Who are you callin' busted, buster?
That's right.
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid, or smashed or ripped apart. "We"?
That's right!
Your toys!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
From now on, you must take good care of your toys!
Because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid.
We toys can see everything.
So play nice.
We did it!
We did it!
Yes!
The toys!
The toys are alive!
Nice toy.
What's wrong, Sid?
Don't you want to play with Sally?
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.
Woody.
Thanks.
Everybody say, "Bye, house!" Woody!
The van!
Bye, house.
We gotta run!
Thanks, guys!
Quick!
Just go.
I'll catch up.
Come on!
You can do it, Woody!
I got it!
I made it.
Get away, you stupid dog!
Down!
Down!
Hold on, Woody!
I can't do it.
Take care ofAndy for me!
No!
Buzz!
Are we there already?
Woody?
How did you...?
How'd he get here?
Where have you...?
What happened?
What's goin' on?
What's he takin'?
There you are!
Hey.
What's he doing?
He's at it again!
Get him!
Come on!
No, no!
No, no, no, no!
Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Pig pile!
Get outta that car!
Move it!
No!
Please!
You don't understand!
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.
No!
Toss him overboard!
No, no, no!
Wait!
Hooray!
So long, Woody!
Oh!
Woody!
Oh!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Look out!
Now let's catch up to that truck.
Guys!
Guys!
Woody's riding R.C.
What?
And Buzz is with him!
It is Buzz!
Woody was telling the truth.
What have we done?
Great!
Now I have guilt.
We're almost there!
Rocky, the ramp!
Look out!
Quick!
Hold onto my tail!
Attaboy, Slink!
Oh!
Woody!
Woody!
Speed up!
Speed up!
The batteries!
They're runnin' out!
I can't hold on much longer.
Slink!
Hang on!
Great!
Woody!
The rocket!
The match!
Yes!
Thank you, Sid!
No!
No, no!
No!
No!
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No!
Woody!
What are you doing?
Hold still, Buzz!
You did it!
Next stop, Andy!
Wait a minute.
I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!
I should have held on longer.
Look!
Look!
It's Woody and Buzz comin' up fast!
Woody!
Take cover!
This is the part where we blow up!
Not today!
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'!
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.
To infinity and beyond!
Buzz, we missed the truck.
We're not aiming for the truck.
Hey, wow!
What?
What is it?
Woody!
Buzz!
Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?
Here in the car!
See?
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.
Which one can I open first?
Let's let Molly open one.
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.
Whoa!
It's time!
Oh, Bo.
There's got to be a less painful way to get my attention.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.
That way I could play the dominant predator.
Quiet, everyone!
Quiet!
Molly's first present is Mrs Potato Head.
Repeat, a Mrs Potato Head.
Way to go, Idaho!
Gee, I'd better shave.
Come in, Frankincense.
Andy is now opening his first present.
It's...
Buzz.
Buzz Lightyear, you are not worried, are you?
I can't quite...
Me?
No, no.
Make out...
No.
No, no, no, no.
A large box...
It's...
Are you?
Now, Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?
Oh, what is it?
What is it?
Wow!
A puppy!
You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me When the road looks rough ahead And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed You just remember what your old pal said Boy, you've got a friend in me Yeah, you've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me You got troubles And I got 'em too There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you If we stick together we can see it through 'Cause you've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am Bigger and stronger too Maybe But none of them will ever love you the way I do It's me and you, boy And as the years go by Our friendship will never die You're gonna see it's our destiny You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me
Hi, I'm Don Hahn, I'm the producer of Lion King.
I'm Rob Minkoff, director of The Lion King.
And Roger Allers, director of Lion King.
And we're here to perform the top 40 hits for you.
No, we're here to comment for you on the making of The Lion King.
Kind of share some of our experiences with you, right here in your own living room.
The project started, actually, as King of the Jungle.
And the original concept was to do a picture in Africa about lions, but no one at the time knew what the story was gonna be.
Then it kind of evolved from there into being an original story, which is unique for us.
Usually we do stories based on fairytales or novels or bits of literature.
But Lion King was unique in that it was completely out of thin air.
Even though it was informed by a little bit of Hamlet, little bit of Old Testament Bible stories like Joseph or Moses, that kind of thing.
Originally, in the opening of the picture we were going to have a dialog scene to introduce the characters, to introduce baby Simba, introduce Rafiki as the shaman coming to bless the child.
Right.
Actually, we had scenes of animals walking to Pride Rock.
And then we had Zazu talking about, "Everybody, get in the line.
Get in the line." There was so much chatter, and at that time also, Rafiki, no one knew who Rafiki was.
But when we heard Hans' version of how he Africanized Circle of Life, we all just went crazy.
In four minutes of music, Elton John and Tim Rice, God bless them, created this beautiful… What became an anthem for the movie that defined the spirit of the movie and the theme of the movie.
In the shot where we rack focus from the ants in the foreground to the zebras in the background, that was the concept from the storyboard, where we were literally trying to do something that's very common in a live action picture but is very rarely seen or never seen in an animated picture, which is literally to use the focal length of the camera.
But in our case we have to replicate what that might look like under these circumstances where it's artificially done.
And yet gives you that sort of sense that you're really looking at a real world.
The whole fly-in scene where you reveal the African savanna and you see Pride Rock for the first time, Pride Rock is kind of like the castle for the lions, is all done in one continuous shot.
It's all done in one.
You go from this vast overview of the savanna into a close-up of Mufasa without cutting.
Now, the great thing with this shot of Rafiki coming up, it gives you the feeling of sunlight filtering through the characters.
And it's all the great CAPS magical tricks that you can do with special effects, animation and graphics.
Or the clouds which are actually a flat two-dimensional painting which is skewed by the computer. "Skewing" means it kind of stretches it out.
And always when we previewed the film, I remember going to the Pasadena theater for the first time where we previewed it, and little Simba turns around for the first time, -always was a surefire "aw." It's an "aw shucks" moment.
And the funny thing about Circle of Life, it's a great stand-alone piece because without giving anything about the movie away, it kind of gives you a sense of epic scale in Africa and all that stuff.
And it went out in November.
Six months before the movie was released.
That's right, exactly, and the thing that we were all so worried about was that nobody would know what the title of this movie was, because they hadn't heard it before.
That was a big concern. "Do you think people are gonna go?" Here's something that the folks in the theater probably would never care about.
But we really cared about trying to get all the clouds in the background to match speed.
There are several different paintings of Pride Rock that we had to match from one to the next.
The cliff he stands on, because you get so close to it, was painted really large so that when you got close the detail was clear for the large movie screen.
But had to be shrunk down to fit onto Pride Rock, so all those things.
How many levels do you think we had?
How many background levels?
Too numerous to mention at this point.
Those are the sort of things people like to hear -but we don't remember them.
Yeah.
That's one of the great things about the CAP system, which is our fancy computerized animation production system, where you can put together seemingly endless levels of animation and backgrounds, and clouds and effects and things, and sandwich them together without being limited by reality because it's all done in a digital universe.
Right, it is the ultimate multi-plane camera.
Yeah.
We're rarely limited by reality.
Well, yes, especially you guys.
Okay.
Reality unlimited.
Ah, the mouse.
Great scene by Brian Ferguson. -I think it's interesting… No, he gave us… Sorry.
I was just gonna say that it's interesting that the very first line of dialog you hear in the movie is, "Life's not fair." Yeah, 'cause there was no dialog in the opening song at all.
You see, I… Well, I shall never be king.
So in that introductory scene, where we've got all the characters talking for the first time, we've got Scar, who was animated by Andreas Deja.
And Zazu, who was animated by Ellen Woodbury.
What's amazing about Ellen is I've never seen anybody get into a character as much as she would.
She would flap around the studio and pretend she was a bird.
She'd do all the research you could possibly imagine on a hornbill bird.
You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you.
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.
And Jeremy Irons, what a guy he was, huh?
Sure was.
It's funny, 'cause I think both Jeremy and Rowan Atkinson who plays Zazu here, they were really reluctant about lending their voices to an animated character, because a lot of who they are is their persona and their personality and their appearance.
And so we had to record a test and animate something so they could see how their characters started to come to life, and then they were seduced by it.
Actually, I heard an interesting story from Jeremy's agent, who said that they were having dinner together at Morton's restaurant, and a seven-year-old boy walks up to the agent and says, "Is that Scar?" And of course it was.
This is one of the biggest pieces of background artwork we have.
It's a huge 20-field pan.
You'd never know.
It's interesting about art direction, things like lighting that you never notice or think of as an audience perhaps, but there's a real light direction in the mouth of the cave that comes in, and our effects animators put tone mattes on the characters so that there's a sense of light and dark on the character to create a light direction.
Contact shadows under the characters.
Nice growl.
That was always tough, trying to get the lion growl to sort of interface with James's dialog.
Because I remember in some of the sessions, he would do these… "Is that a challenge?" Well, Mark Mangini, again, who did some of the growls for the Beast in Beauty and the Beast, had put together real tiger and animal growls with dialog in Beauty, and he used a little bit of that same technique here, where he could play a little animal growl underneath James Earl's voice and get a sense of animal.
What am I going to do with him?
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.
Zazu!
And just think, whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him.
Now, the scenes coming up really were inspired by our trip to Africa.
I mean, these are practically photographs that we brought back with us.
I remember standing out in this field.
I was standing in this field, watching the rain drifting across.
It's a great place.
Huge expanses where the weather can be so separate in different parts… Originally, this scene, the lightning scene -was done without this tree.
That's right.
We had to add this tree when we came back to add Rafiki into the sequence.
We did a preview where Rafiki wasn't as present in the movie as we would like, and so we put him into this sequence at a later date.
And added the idea of the icon as well.
The Simba icon that he was drawing, which actually carries through thematically through the whole piece.
Of course he does have… What was the thing about this?
The pink?
The pink chalk?
Is it pink in his… Yeah, if you look, the color is different in the bowl than it is on what he paints on the thing.
Another little mistake.
Dad!
Dad!
One thing we found out about lions really early is they just sleep all the time.
And this is our sleeping lion scene.
They sleep together, too.
Yeah.
It's interesting how they, in the king and queen's throne room we've got basically everyone else.
It's a commune.
Because in nature it's usually one lion and many lionesses.
Or occasionally, brothers rule a pride, which is what this story is about.
Right.
Interesting.
You promised.
And Jonathan was really incredible, too.
We went through so many audition tapes of child actors to find Jonathan who had such a great natural ability to act and had such an interesting quirky voice.
Yeah, he was terrific.
And he's also on the cover of Tiger Beat magazine. -I think that's important to note.
Yeah.
Look, Simba.
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
Wow.
A king's time… This shot is amazing because it's a camera dolly around the character, which is very unconventional in animation.
And to do it, we actually started with kind of a computer framework to show how the camera might move around these characters.
Yeah, we built a very simple model of Mufasa and Simba on the cliff and rotated around so that the animator would have an underpinning, an understructure to put his animation on.
It was Chris Wahl, wasn't it?
Yeah.
And Chris followed that computer guideline so you get, in that final scene, a feeling that the camera's actually moving around the characters, which is great.
It helps that sense of reality and mood and place.
That's the kind of thing we are trying to do throughout the whole picture, was take you into the image.
Yeah, have more of a sense of cinematography.
Exactly.
I always loved this shot.
The idea of sound effects, you hear a little grass with the antelope running through, and you get the huge perspective of antelope in the foreground and then middle ground, and then they show up way in the distance towards the end of the shot.
I was just gonna say not in an animation way, but just in terms of a scripting way, the idea of having Mufasa talk about that they eat other animals was really important to me.
I always thought this is a really great idea.
I thought it would be great to ennoble the whole idea of the balance of life, the prey-predator and how it's all connected.
Remember the joke we had at one point where he was saying, "And we're all connected in the great circle of life." And we had an antelope off in the distance. "Isn't that right, Joe?" "Right you are, Mufasa." "Catch you later, Joe." "Not if I can help it." Then he takes off in the distance.
There was a song here at one time.
There was a big… Oh.
To Be King.
To Be King, which was Dad's day out.
In the storyboard, and in the original outline, it always said, "Dad's day out." And it was a male-bonding day between dad and son.
But it just never quite fired up.
You never believed Mufasa out there in the woods, singing and dancing.
Here comes my favorite character in the film.
This little sweet groundhog who always in previews got the biggest laugh.
He was going to be a naked mole rat, but we couldn't get the thing to look right.
But we couldn't get the rights. -He had a tough agent.
It's true.
We would have lost our "G" rating.
But it's funny underground humor.
It is. -It's a throwback to World War II.
Yeah.
And Hogan's Heroes.
Yes, and this line.
Setting up the hyenas.
Remember?
We had a different line there.
It was a transitional scene trying to not only set up the hyenas, but get you led back to Scar and what he's doing.
Right.
This was also one of the very earliest scenes done.
That's the first scene, wasn't it, of Scar by Andreas?
Yeah.
First scene animated.
There's a neat lighting thing going on here, too, because whenever you see young Simba, he's out in the sunlight and looking out over the vast Pride Lands.
And then whenever you see Scar, he's under the overhang of the cliff, in the shadows, symbolically being the nasty one.
Gary Trousdale storyboarded this scene.
It's funny because you never see the storyboard drawings, but it's always the point of departure for what the scene ultimately looks like.
And so Gary's attitudes and the way this whole scene was boarded out started long before the animation.
That's Simba, who was animated by Mark Henn.
And Scar animated by Andreas Deja.
It's really great to see two great animators acting with each other.
This is one of the purest scenes where you can see that.
Two great guys who know what they're doing, with great voices to work with, just acting like crazy.
What's interesting is that Andreas was animating Scar in I., and Mark was animating Simba in Florida.
And all these things were zapping back and forth across the coast.
And we recorded Jeremy in London.
And Jonathan in Zimbabwe. -No.
That's not true.
In the design process we usually start with a conception of the character from the imagination.
And once we actually attach a voice to it and hire the actor and start recording that actor, then the lead animator of that character takes on that character and literally starts to work with it and define it and refocus it.
And a lot of times they are so influenced by the look of the actor that it can't help but manifest itself in the final design.
I love this shot where Simba is running down the hill past the lionesses basking in the dapple light.
It seems simple, but I remember everybody trying to get the dapple light right because sunlight filtering through trees in animation ain't so easy.
So, getting the effects animators to work together with the art director and get that feeling, and they did a lovely job.
This all came from a pre-production sketch by Andy Gaskill.
He was just exploring different environments of where the lions would live, and he did this beautiful thing of the lions sleeping on a dappled ledge.
And we pretty much just lifted it right off and stuck it right in the film.
We should talk about Niketa a little bit.
We never mentioned her. -Niketa Calame.
Yes.
Sweet little girl who came in and read along with every little girl in Hollywood to do the voice of Nala.
And we ended up with Niketa, who was really natural.
I think that was her forte.
She was just herself and brought so much edge and character to Nala.
It was great.
It's actually interesting… I was gonna say that it's interesting because one of the issues we had to deal with in this film was it was taking place in Africa, and although it was animated, how are we gonna cast the characters in terms of their ethnic background?
So, we had James Earl Jones, who's obviously African-American, and we have him with a son who is Matthew Broderick, who is obviously not African-American.
And yet we have Niketa Calame who is African-American, growing up to be Moira Kelly who is not.
So, we had this big jumble and big mix-up of characters and things.
And what was interesting about this film is that we could really literally be color blind as far as it not mattering at all.
It was really about who the character was, who the performer was and what they brought to the character.
It's almost a nice commentary on how everyone's voice blended together to create this piece of theater.
Also we have Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the voice actor for Simba, and when we go into the song he becomes Jason Weaver.
Right.
Yeah, who played Michael Jackson.
The other thing going into Can't Wait to Be King, it was one of the first songs that came in.
And it was meant to be kind of a peppy upbeat kids' point of view of Africa.
But the challenge was always to try to reflect that in the art direction.
And our production designer Chris Sanders took that challenge on and created a look for this song that was pretty unique to the rest of the film.
Right, it was supposed to be really literally from Simba's point of view, so the idea was to evoke brighter colors and bolder patterns and shapes so that it would feel more childlike.
And interestingly, because we knew we had this departure to make, in terms of going from reality to fantasy, we decided to bring the audience there by a very, very abrupt change so that they would be aware, literally, of the change of tempo and tone and idea.
The idea during the kind of the trees going by is you got Simba and Nala chasing in one direction, and you have all these palm trees panning by in the other direction.
And the idea was to try to make them strobe by and subconsciously do this little hula thing.
Like a zoetrope.
Yeah, Zazu and the rhino butt, a guaranteed laugh.
The log in the river, actually they gave us a little template.
CGI worked out a little template for the log in the river, again to help us move the characters through a moving camera point of view.
I love that transition between the ripples in the water into zebra stripes, too, those kinds of things that you can do in a song and maybe not get by with at other places.
One of the problems, too, is if we had taken the animals from The Circle of Life and started having them dance around on their hind feet… Singing and dancing. …it would look really terrible.
So we had to go more stylized to allow the animals more free reign to be silly and comic.
Chris really used African artwork and textiles and patterns and fabrics, and was really inspired by those shapes to put into Can't Wait to Be King.
The end of this song was storyboarded in a whole different way at one point.
Where were we before?
How did this thing end?
Simba and Nala ran away off in the hills and we saw them from a distance finishing up the song.
Not much of a punchy ending, so to go really all out, Busby Berkeley, we wanted to put them in the middle of it.
And it turned out to be a laugh riot.
The ending shot of this song is really interesting 'cause you basically have a hornbill trapped under a rhino's butt.
And you would think maybe there's something funny about this.
And we had a recording session with Rowan Atkinson.
The poor guy.
And we gave him 17, no less than 17 different things to say under a rhino's butt.
Things like, "Haven't we met before?" Or, "I'll never tango again." All right!
It worked!
We lost him.
I am a genius.
Hey, genius, it was my idea.
This was setting up a very important point for our movie later on, which is that Nala is gonna pin Simba later on.
And he has to recognize her.
Yes, he has to recognize her.
So we thought she should do something physically that he would remember.
So that was what we ended up on.
The Nala flip.
The Nala flip.
Notice how the art direction changed, too.
It was kind of bright sunny day above, and once they roll down the cliff, it's all elephant graveyard, moody and mysterious.
You see all that dust moving in the foreground, which is actually done by a computer program.
There's a brilliant man who worked on our movie named Randy Fullmer, who kind of corralled all this.
His job is artistic coordinator, and he along with Ann Tucker in our scene planning department came up with this idea of turbulence, which you see here in the mist and moving through the elephant graveyard.
Scott Santoro was the head of our special effects department, and normally with special effects you think of rocket ships and laser guns and big explosions, which is absolutely true.
But also in animation you have the kind of side of it that's lighting and shadow and subtlety.
And in almost every shot in Lion King, there's some form of special effect, so in a sequence like this which seems fairly simple, it's loaded with shadows and tone mattes and lighting effects that make the character really feel like it's in its environment.
What tone mattes are, are the shadowed areas on the characters that define the character as a three-dimensional form.
Especially in this film where we had lions who were all one color.
If we had not had the tone mattes which gave the internal shadows on their bodies, they would have come out looking so flat.
Yellow-gold-orange, yellow-yellow, yellow-brown, yellow-orange.
Yeah.
So our effects department pretty much drew shadows on all these characters throughout the whole movie.
Not a fun task, but, boy, it really made everybody become very three-dimensional.
You can also see in terms of like what the CAP system does, when Zazu's bill goes from yellow to orange, there's a blend happening between those two colors which was something that we're able to do with a computer.
That you couldn't have done five years ago.
If this were Fantasia back in the '40s, you would have airbrushed all that, and it would have crawled around and been very fragile.
Now you can get a lovely blended look.
This is great.
I remember one day we were working on the movie, trying to figure out who to cast for several of the parts, and Peter Schneider walks in and goes, "Whoopi Goldberg wants to be in your movie." We hadn't cast the hyenas, in fact, we had read auditions for the hyenas, including Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, who came in to audition for the hyenas, and ultimately were cast as Pumbaa and Timon.
We hadn't quite landed on who would play these characters.
Gary Trousdale had come up with a Cheech and Chong idea.
But we found out that they wouldn't work together anymore, -so we… We kept Cheech. -Ended up with Cheech and Whoopi.
There you go.
And Ed, who was loosely based on Ed McMahon and Harpo Marx, all mixed together, who could just laugh at their jokes.
And he was played by Jim Cummings, who we had the most amazing recording session with, 'cause he came in for four hours and basically laughed.
Every kind of laugh. "Laugh apprehensively." "Laugh like Ricky Ricardo." "Laugh like Lucy." As the chase starts, the art direction heats up again, so you really get a lot of reds and stuff on the screen.
That's the great thing about animation is you can light and do whatever you want to so that the art direction can support what's going on emotionally on the screen.
This was funny, pounding on Jonathan's back, so he could do the uh-uh-uh-uh Going down the spinal cord.
These got to be really complex scenes in here 'cause you had six characters on the screen, on and off, and their shadows and tone mattes.
This is a great shot, as the cubs round the corner and go past all those foreground cliffs and reveal this big elephant carcass, for lack of a better word.
And it's got a little skin on it and they crawl up to the top.
There's a little color pop here.
It's not much to look at.
We couldn't fix it because we ran out of time.
Yeah. -Who did those growls for Simba?
That was Jonathan.
I remember we experimented with real animal growls and young cubs sound like kittens almost.
This is like a grizzly bear, mixed with a tiger, mixed with a F-16 fly by.
One of the big challenges of doing The Lion King was the fact that it was an all-animal story as opposed to many of the other pictures we've done recently which were primarily human based.
So the entire staff of animators had to learn how to do four-legged animals.
They went to the zoo, they went to Africa.
They really lived with these animals.
We had Jim Fowler, who you remember from the old Wild Kingdom show, came into the studio with… "That's Jim wrestling the anaconda "while I'm sitting here in the tent." "We'll be right back." Jim came in one day and brought seven lions and lionesses in.
Cubs, females, males.
Beautiful creatures.
And you really get a sense for what their power is and majesty and the feeling of those creatures when you're about three feet away from them with nothing between you but a piece of paper and a pencil.
There was lots of research done.
We studied films.
We went to Africa, watched them in the wild, brought back photographs.
We ate a whole caribou one night.
That was good.
I remember that.
When we showed the film in Japan for the first time, we got absolutely no response.
I mean, no laughter to any of the jokes up until this joke when Zazu says, "Good luck." And it gets a huge laugh.
It brought down the house.
We all asked afterwards why it happened, and apparently it's a cultural thing.
When you get in trouble in Japan and you go off to be reprimanded, people will tell you, "Good luck." Simba!
An important symbol in the film is when Simba puts his foot in the footprint.
It tells you about the whole film, that someday we'll have to fill our fathers' footsteps. -It's a visual metaphor.
It is.
The audience related to this scene perhaps more than any other because we've all been in Simba's position here.
Actually, here's an interesting one is that we really were trying to actually do a sunset during the whole course of this sequence so that every single background had to transition from this pink sunset setting to a starry night.
Do you know how we did it actually?
For a lot of it, it was just two backgrounds.
A dark one and a light one.
And then you just added… We would literally transition pinkness or blueness to it.
It was a percentage.
We would have it mostly on the pink and then we would increase the percentage on the starry night as we decreased on the pink sky.
It's also the point in the movie where we start to introduce the star metaphor, which then became very important later in the film.
Yes, that was actually an invention of Jim Capobianco.
Yeah.
It was nice.
There needed to be a way to express the idea of forefathers, generations gone by, in a way that was somewhat spiritual and had a link somehow to the generations gone by.
And the stars became that metaphor.
And of course this piece of scoring was not the original piece.
Yeah, Hans had written a piece of score for this whole area. -It was quite lovely, but… We changed it.
We changed it.
We used it in another place.
You're talking about the theme where we used it for his ascension to Pride Rock.
Yeah.
That's where we slipped it.
Now, if you look at the stars closely, they form the constellation Leo.
Is that true?
It is true.
Yeah.
Yes. if any of you listening are astronomers, you can please call us.
Although you're not supposed to be able to see the constellation Leo -from East Africa.
From the Equator?
Apparently.
Really?
That's what somebody told me.
I bet you could. -Anyway.
I'm no astronomer.
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.
It's not funny, Ed.
Jim Cummings' laugh.
Jim Cummings' laugh, a little more turbulence mist coming up from the… But no tone mattes because we had to cut back.
That's right.
We ran out of money.
No, there were places throughout the movie where you have to cut back.
And so you have to pick those moments where it's not going to conflict.
But interestingly we used that shadowing process so that at the bottoms of the characters, it falls off into shadow, so it does give it a dimensional effect.
One of the things I think Andy Gaskill wanted to do with this sequence was make it kind of a geothermically unstable place, so you get really theatrical curtains of steam rising up from cracks in the Earth.
And because, as you know, when we were making this film we went through the Northridge earthquake.
The big Northridge earthquake, which is incorporated into this song.
We survived floods, fires, a riot.
A plague of locusts.
And commissary food, all during the making of this film.
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us.
I mean, you're our pal.
Here comes a meat gag.
Yes, very controversial meat gag.
We weren't sure whether we could actually show meat on screen.
Can you show meat?
Can you show zebra meat on screen?
We decided that if it was striped… It was funny, then.
Somehow it was funny.
Although it had to look like a ham.
Like a cartoon ham. -It's the Tom and Jerry cartoon ham.
Yeah, it's kind of a Tex Avery ham.
And here they're like eating neck ties, so you don't really feel like they are eating meat.
See, there goes a necktie.
And the meat used to be pinker. -We grayed it down.
We had to gray it down.
Which of course made it look rancid.
Like rotten meat.
Which was even worse.
Which was much more appealing and PC.
Be Prepared is the big villain song.
And Jeremy Irons, boy, he went through lots of rehearsal, and an eight-hour session at a studio one day to come up with the vocals for this song. -He did great.
He did great.
But by the end of the day, he had blown out his voice.
Most people don't think of Jeremy Irons as a singer, but he was.
He, early in his career, played John the Baptist in Godspell, in the West End in London.
So he really did start out as a singer and performs well in this one.
When this song came in from Elton and Tim, it was called Thanks to Me.
And the lyrics were, "Thanks to me it's goodbye Mufasa. "Thanks to me little Simba's gone bad," or something like that. "Little Simba needs prayers." Needs prayers, yeah, and it was great, but as the story evolved, we wanted the notion that Scar was plotting behind… It was actually in a different place.
Right.
Originally, it was much longer after the hyenas were waiting to take over, and Scar was putting them off.
It was also after Mufasa was killed.
Right, it was long after Mufasa was killed, and we were feeling like, "What?
It's so late." It makes much more sense to have a plotting song and really get the juices going for this takeover, -so we moved it up earlier.
The melody stuck.
This is a track that Hans Zimmer did in a weekend. "We left his studio on a Friday night and said, "Hans, give us a kind of "fun, sinister, Cirque Du Soleil thing." In fact, I don't think we even said that.
I think we just left him alone.
And he came back with, basically, what you hear today.
Carnival in hell was one of our… Carnival in hell was the brief..
He came back on Monday morning and played this for us, and we were pretty amazed.
And then one of our great storyboard artists, Jorgen Klubien, took the material, and he and Andy Gaskill, our art director, were inspired by Leni Riefenstahl.
Kind of fascist documentary stuff.
And thought maybe we could layer the idea of Scar as the fascist dictator on this whole dynamic of the movie here.
Well, the idea is when we introduced the yellow lights, was to give you the colors of, like, an old news reel.
So that we colored everything in kind of these old browny yellows.
Like dirty old yellows and black, like an old news reel.
Especially for mud.
This scene, in the director's cut, we should replace this.
Yeah, a lot of debate about this scene in previews, whether it was appropriate, and how much we would lean in the direction of this kind of fascist, fascism-on-parade kind of thing.
And here it kind of turns into that bacchanal in hell, carnival, Mardi Gras in a graveyard feeling.
And the earthquake.
This was based on Rob's backyard during the earthquake, actually.
It's funny, on the early demos of this song, both Rob and Roger and I, all of us sing.
And so for a long time when we were workshopping and trying to get through these songs, -we were the hyenas.
That's right. -Tim Rice sang Scar's part.
Beautifully.
And the three of us were the hyenas.
That's right.
In fact, I think we've survived as hyenas.
There's some of our laughing.
Some of our laughing is still on the soundtrack.
And this is all samples.
Hans Zimmer sitting at the keyboard in his studio with sample sounds, playing this whole thing.
This shot.
Those moving shadows over the cliffs.
Cloud shadows moving across the Serengeti.
This is another Mark Henn and Andreas Deja scene.
Mark animating Simba, and Andreas animating Scar.
And it just shows you what you can do with a great vocal performance.
And no props, these characters have no props.
They can't hold things in their hands, they're standing on their hands.
They have no opposable thumb.
The other thing, I think, that's interesting to note is some of the very long scenes.
What we tried to do is stay on the characters and stay on a shot, rather than over-cutting things to really give you a chance to be with the characters, to let them perform and get across what they were doing.
Another tip of the hat to Jeremy Irons, I think.
In a recording session, he would give us 10 and 15 and 20 takes on a different color of the line every time.
And then our editor, Tom Finan, would work with the directors and put a performance together that sounded very cohesive.
But Jeremy was terrific.
Hey, Uncle Scar, will I like this surprise?
Simba, it's to die for.
Actually, the thing we're really trying to do in this sequence is, we've got several storylines going on, we have to set different things up.
And it was important to actually keep the thread moving throughout each, so that, again, you were carried through sort of in a seamless way.
And this leads us into probably the centerpiece of the movie, certainly the turning point of the movie, the wildebeest stampede, which was originally storyboarded by Thom Enriquez, in a career-long move.
Thom took probably a year and a half, almost his whole career on the movie, to do the stampede, and then we turned it over to the CG department, the computer graphics department, with their animators and technical directors, and they were the ones responsible for bringing the wildebeest stampede to life on the screen.
In this movie, they did the wildebeests, they did the turning Pride Rock, and they also did the water from Can't Wait to Be King.
It's the same kind of effects you would see in the ballroom of Beauty and the Beast or the flying carpet in Aladdin, that kind of unique character situation that can only be handled with the help of a computer.
Scott Johnston was our CGI supervisor, and he wrangled this whole thing, and it really was a project that took the full three years of production for what amounts to about six or seven minutes on the screen.
What's really amazing is that all of those beasts are really based on a singular run cycle that was created by the CGI department.
Then they added on different behaviors like bucks -and kicks, and different things.
Head shakes.
Changing leads.
Yeah, but the program that they invented was something called an avoidance program where they would send the wildebeest, literally moving towards each other, but they would always turn away at the last minute.
So they really replicated what a real stampede would do.
Which is, you've got thousands of beasts running, and they're going to constantly try to avoid each other, so you're getting a complete sense of what it would look like.
It's interesting because the reason they did that is because the computer does not recognize what is three-dimensional objects.
The computer would have the actual beast crossing in and out of each other like ghosts if they didn't do this.
So, in order to have them not occupy the same space, they did that program, which again, underlines the natural behavior of these beasts.
It's odd.
It's the first time for us we really tackled flesh and blood characters being animated by the computer.
And the reason the computer graphics guys did it this way is it would be impossible to actually sit down and draw tens of thousands of wildebeest storming through a gorge.
And for Jonathan Taylor Thomas, when we were doing all of this, him falling this way and that way, we actually had to pick him up and fling him around the recording studio so we could get These screams and yells out of him.
That was the very first scene that was put in color, Zazu hitting the wall.
That's a really interesting little scene, it just goes by so fast, but the camera dollies from left to right on the sea of wildebeests.
And it goes by really fast, but it's actually a very sophisticated scene because what you're seeing is the entire herd is running at you and changing perspective as the camera dollies to follow Mufasa, as Mufasa doubles back to save Simba.
Again, that's something that would be very simple to do in live action, but in animation you really have to go out of your way to replicate it.
The combination of the computer-generated wildebeest, and the hand-drawn animation, all the Simba, Mufasa and Scar artwork, of course, would have been drawn by hand.
And then the effects animators putting in shadows, the turbulence dust on top of it, put together with a hand-painted background, created a pretty amazing effect.
And then Hans Zimmer wrote a piece of score for here that was… I remember the night we went over to his studio and heard it for the first time, it was probably one of the most powerful pieces of music -I had ever experienced.
Yeah.
Musically here, Hans went to South Africa and London, and a lot of the voices you're hearing on the track here are a combination of London choral group singing with the South African singers, to give you a really panicked kind of soundtrack.
This was a big debate here, trying to figure out how Simba should or shouldn't see the death of his father, -to try to sidetrack Simba enough.
That's why we had him climbing the cliffs so there was rocks, so he didn't see it during all of this.
It was crucially… These scenes coming up here. -…important that he not see it.
Right. 'Cause then the guilt trip wouldn't work.
And this scene, which we decided was one of our longer scenes, we decided we really wanted to hold on this shot and allow Simba to move through this whole sense of three-dimensional space to really believe in.
That's really the way you convey space in animation is, you have to allow the character to move within the three dimensions that exist.
Scene coming up, where Simba confronts the body of his father.
We spent a lot of time in story and previewing and discussion.
And we animated several versions of it.
Mark Henn went through anguish trying to get this to be the right mixture of pathos and emotion, to make this moment work.
It's a tribute to all the craftsmen coming together, 'cause you have the staging that the layout people did so beautifully, and certainly the direction that makes it a very poignant moment.
And Jonathan's acting in this part.
For a while we thought, "Should we try real animal sounds?" Oh, God, that's right.
We recorded the whimperings of lion cubs. 'Cause we thought, "That will be really sad." You know how you feel when there's an animal… And the whimperings of Frank Welker.
Frank Welker is a very talented voice artist in town, and came in and whimpered for a half hour.
We thought, this is going to be really sad, and we cut it in and it wasn't.
It was weird.
Because even though these are lions, it's a very human story.
And then Rob came in one day, he saw a Rescue 911 or something, I remember, and you were talking about the woman whose daughter fell into a swimming pool or something, and was running around going, "Help, please, somebody help me!" And that kind of panicked attitude you have when you don't know where to turn, and you're just shouting for help, but there maybe isn't any help, and that kind of spawned the idea of Simba running around.
He knows it's hopeless, but he's still looking for maybe that last chance that his father could be alive.
It's one of the most sensitive issues in the film is, literally, dealing with the death.
Whether or not to deal with it off screen, which is a choice they made in Bambi.
And we decided to go purposefully the opposite direction, for the specific reason to allow Simba to confront the issue of death in a very real, personal and immediate way.
Especially because this is going to be his issue that he has to deal with for the rest of the picture.
The whole idea of Simba's guilt materialized a little later in the game. -It wasn't an original notion.
No.
That Scar would actually wind Simba up to make Simba believe that his father's death was actually somehow his fault.
But as the story developed, that became pretty central.
It was really necessary because we always had a problem with, "Why doesn't Simba go back home?" When he ran away, and was gone for a while, we were always up against the problem of what motivates him to stay away?
Simba's just having a bad day, you know.
If it's not one thing it's another.
It's also interesting to think how these stories track in terms of time. -Because it's very condensed.
Yeah.
This is all two days.
The beginning of this movie takes place in two days.
This is interesting, this whole area of the movie was actually animated -flopped or reversed.
From right to left.
Simba was escaping from the right to the left.
And then as the movie was up on reels, pretty deep in the process, "the guys looked at each other one day and said, "You know, "we've established the Pumbaa and Timon jungle" "is always off on screen right." "But here Simba's escaping to the left." So this whole chunk was flopped. -All this.
But actually it really isn't.
I think it was completely unnecessary.
In fact, now that I think about it, I think -we should go back the other way.
Well, okay.
Whoopi's so interesting.
We recorded her separately from Cheech, and the one time we got them together, they were great together, but most of the time we record them separately, yet it still sounds like they're in the same room together. -I don't know how that works.
Yeah.
I think that's actually something people aren't aware of as much is that we do almost all the actors separately.
And we have to basically bring it all together in the editing room.
Now we see Simba clearly escaping to screen right, where later we'll find Pumbaa and Timon.
But are they on the right?
There was a song here once.
Yes.
It was a reprise of Be Prepared.
Which we do use musically, don't we?
No, we don't use it even.
Not at all?
No.
There was once imagined a reprise of Scar's song Be Prepared here, as Scar ushers the hyenas in, seemed to be a bit too much of a stage wait or something.
It was too lively to the mood.
You needed to come down from the death, from all that activity, you needed to have that low point.
It was also rubbing the audience's nose in the death.
We showed the movie at the AMC in Burbank, and it was a preview for Michael and Roy Disney. "Michael's big thing after seeing the movie is, "I love Rafiki, "he's a great character, and you get what he is in the movie," "but you just don't see him enough, you don't see his character" "threaded through the movie enough." So, a lot of moments, particularly this one where he's mourning over the loss of Simba, kind of come out of rebuilding from that preview.
There used to be a sequence in here, if I could just ruminate, where Simba was lost and alone in the inhospitable waste.
There was a little sequence where he was out on the sand dunes, and he was walking in the desert.
Kind of a Lawrence of Arabia thing.
And we simplified it by using the icon of Simba as a transition to the apparently dead Simba, so you don't know, so you think, "Boy, this hasn't just been a bad day." -I mean, this has been… This has been a bad day.
Now, interestingly enough, these vultures used to be characters.
That's right.
Yeah.
Long ago.
But we tried a bunch of different kinds of vultures.
We tried vultures as newscasters.
We had the old Yiddish vultures.
We had the radio announcer vultures.
It was all black humor, they were all talking about, "Hey, kid, you might as well give up." "We're ready for you.
We're going to eat you." "It's not looking so good for you, is it?" Yeah.
And it was, like, a scene played out with these vultures as characters.
And it was very funny, really funny.
It was too funny, and it kind of stole the thunder from Pumbaa and Timon.
And so, we knew the audience had to be rooting for Pumbaa and Timon, and we introduced these vultures which we would never pay off later, so we ended up just making them real vultures.
Make them sinister.
Yeah.
Now, the funny story is that Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella came in to audition in New York as hyenas.
I think Nathan also came in and auditioned for Zazu's role.
So, when we were in Los Angeles listening through all the tapes, we were trying to figure out who Timon and Pumbaa should be, and we listened to Nathan and Ernie's hyena audition, and it was so funny.
They were so funny together.
They played together so well and seemed so familiar with each other and so friendly, that we said, "Wouldn't it be great if they were Timon and Pumbaa?" Even the lines they were reading as hyenas were perfect.
They were talking about whether they should attack and eat the wildebeest.
And one of the hyenas as the voice of Nathan Lane said, "What'll it be?
One meal now, or years of feasting in the future?" And Ernie replied, "One meal now, definitely one meal now." And we thought, "That's Timon and Pumbaa." Mike Surrey and Tony Bancroft, the two animators that animated Timon and Pumbaa, were Timon and Pumbaa, they embraced them in every way.
Originally, actually, in the earlier version of the story, Timon and Pumbaa used to be children who grew up with Simba in the Pride Lands.
One of the things we decided to change was to make them outcasts, so that when Simba was exiled, he'd have some friends who could take him under their wing.
And actually Gary Trousdale, who boarded the earliest version of these two characters, came up with the idea of Pumbaa's delicate condition.
Because he came up with the joke, "Hey, kid, pull my horn." And that's what led us off on that whole… "Pull my tusk!" And that's what led us off on this idea that he has a little problem.
He has an occasional indiscretion.
It's, "You got to put your past behind you." Look, kid, bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?
Of course, this gets into our issue about guilt and responsibility.
And which led us to the idea of the song Hakuna Matata, which originally was called The Warthog Rhapsody and covered a whole different idea.
It was just about their fun life and how you get bugs.
It was sort of the way Pumbaa lives.
You know, live according to Pumbaa.
Pumbaa's philosophy.
And what we did is we needed a way to express the idea of Simba turning his back on his responsibility and yet doing it in a way that seemed fun and actually kind of a good thing.
It was Roger one day, as we were sitting around a table, who came up with, "You know, when we were in Kenya, they have this phrase over here "that they use all the time.
It's something like, 'Hakuna matata."' And we all said, "No, that'll never work." It was a ridiculous idea.
But it has, it has such a great rhythm to it.
Just automatically the whole expression, "Hakuna matata." Tim said, "Well, I'll see what I can do with it." It's like Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah and Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo, and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
All those songs wrapped into one.
It's a Disney tradition to come up with words that mean absolutely nothing.
But this does mean something.
It does.
This means "No problem, no worries." So it is a real phrase.
So it's a departure.
Yes.
It's like Que Sera, Sera, kind of thing.
Yeah, that's right.
It's true.
Actually, when we started off, the thing used to start with Timon's verse, where he sang about how he didn't fit into the meerkat colony.
Meerkats are really social animals.
They were very social animals, they all lived in big groups, and they were all supposed to work hard, and he just refused to work.
And so did that verse because we just really couldn't get it to work and we decided to cut it out and start with the chorus which was a little radical.
But The Beatles did it. "Can't Buy Me Love." "Can't Buy Me Love," exactly.
Yeah, and it worked great for them.
You know, hey.
For all you guys at home… That's right.
Every time Pumbaa and Timon swing through… It goes by so fast in the movie, I don't think the audience ever enjoyed it.
They can use their slow button thing.
Yeah, they swing through, and they're in a funny pose every time.
This is Jason Weaver again singing for Simba.
And the next task that this song had to serve was to help Simba grow up.
And how do you show that? -In one scene.
Through dissolves.
But first we'd go to bugs, which was one of the original concepts for the song.
We wanted the whole song to be about eating bugs.
The old warthog song that used to be in this place was all about fun eating bugs in the jungle.
I don't think we ever got our absolute 100% complete bug song. -Never did that.
No, that's okay.
This works.
This is kind of a rites of passage thing in a funny way.
Timon says, "If you're going to live like us, you gotta eat like us." Back to the eating theme.
Join our society, eat a bug.
So, metaphorically speaking… I was going to say, there's a really cool African masked beetle in the corner of that last scene.
Well, that was one that was interesting.
We looked at a lot of reference pictures of the beetles, and they really looked like the inspiration for African masks.
It was very, very interesting.
It's kind of like jungle sushi. -I love this scene, Mark Henn again.
I love this scene.
There were audible sighs of disgust in the audience when we previewed this. -Here we go.
Simba grows up.
Here is the longest log.
The world's longest log.
There's about two seconds in there where you see teenage Simba.
And it's the only time you see him, but there he is.
It's interesting because we demoed that a couple of ways where the background and the characters dissolve at the same time. -Remember that?
Yeah, and you didn't pick up on his transitions.
You never got him growing up, so now in the film the character changes and then the background changes.
And the character and the background, and you really feel a big passage of time.
Also, Simba's singing voice here is Joe Williams, who's the son of John Williams, the Star Wars composer and he was lead singer of Toto.
And who knew that Ernie Sabella has a huge gift for scat singing, but in this little walk up here, he and Nathan, we just let the tape run one day, and they gave us about four hours of scat singing, of which you hear a little bit of it here.
That little trumpet sound is Ernie doing his little mouth trumpet thing.
Kenya, two years later.
Two years.
We were going to have a title card thrown in there, but we thought, "It's a little retro." I love this scene, Zazu's trapped for the amusement of Scar.
Right.
And it's funny.
Rowan Atkinson had never learned It's a Small World.
So we had to have them bring the music along 'cause he hadn't been to Disneyland a million times like we all had, growing up in southern California.
I had to sing it for him a few times to sort of get the melody happening.
And it's funny, he got it right away.
It's the kind of song that sticks to you like glue.
There's nothing like that feeling of walking into a recording session with Jeremy Irons and saying, "Do you know Lovely Bunch of Coconuts?" Originally, actually, we had a gag in there, which I was sorry to lose, which was Scar was looking at the skull of the wildebeest, and he says, "Alas, poor wildebeest, I chewed him well." There used to be a longer interaction where Zazu said, "Only you can rule the pride, as only you do." Trying to say nice things about him.
Of course, this was also to show how the Pride Lands have become degenerated.
The hyenas have overgrazed, shall we say?
That the balance of nature had been thrown akinder.
And Scar… Excuse me? "Akinder"?
I just made that word up.
My daughter's an akinder.
For some reason they translated that "qué pasa" into some other phrase -in Spain.
I don't know why.
Go figure.
I remember that, yeah.
I don't know why.
Ah, the under-the-stars sequence.
Well, it's nice, it's male bonding. -Can we say that?
Yes.
It is.
It's three guys. -They have a great life together.
Buddies out camping.
They've had this… I always thought of this as a Peter Pan scene.
Don't ask me why.
Lost Boys bonding together on their own little oasis.
I always thought a little bit of Stand by Me.
Yeah, same kind of thing.
Under the stars.
Timon?
Yeah?
Ever wonder what those sparkling… Here we get the chance to revisit our thematic star idea.
Which was established earlier with Mufasa and Simba.
Exactly.
Only this time Timon and Pumbaa get to make fun of Simba for believing in it.
There's the "great balls of gas" line, which was -probably the… Great balls of gas!
Probably the biggest laugh in the movie.
That and the Small World thing that Zazu just sang was really big and funny.
Where'd that come… Was that a Jonathan Roberts, Irene Mecchi line?
Exactly.
Yeah.
Actually… How do you remember it, Roger?
Well, I think I came up with the balls of gas, because I don't know what the thing was with Pumbaa, I was saying, "I thought maybe Pumbaa should go" "a little closer to the truth," "that actually you think he's way off, but actually he's right on." You think he's stupid, but he's really Carl Sagan.
Yeah, he's Carl Sagan.
Right.
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us?
Pffff!
So, then they kind of coax out of Simba this bittersweet response.
Of course, the stars remind him of Dad.
Right.
Then they ridicule him for it.
Yeah, like any good friend would.
This was a little problem area, because leading into this, you're trying to communicate Simba's forlorn feeling and ultimately lead you to Rafiki.
So, this transitional device of the pollen.
Pollen blowing in the breeze.
Literally, Simba touched it, so it would carry some of his… Also his exhalation of his woe and sadness carry it along.
You know, we should talk about Robert Guillaume because when he first came in to test for this character, it was a completely different character.
It was a much more serious, profound baboon that would impart wisdom and be a friend to Mufasa. -And so he came in.
A politician.
Yes, a politician. "Sire, I have grave news about the Pride Lands." Robert Guillaume was brilliant doing that.
And then through a variety of story changes we came back, probably three or four months later, and said, "Robert, we still love you, but there's been a few changes made." Suddenly, we have this whacky Jerry Lewis witch doctor character.
Now you're a madman.
We spent almost the whole first recording session with him finding that laugh.
We worked him so hard in all these recording sessions.
He would be leaping up and down and cackling and laughing and he brought so much to this character.
He's my favorite.
He was a man of few words, not Robert but Rafiki.
It seemed like the less he said, the more interesting he was.
If he just spoke in little bits of wisdom and riddles and things that he was a much more interesting character.
Singing the song Lion Sleeps Tonight was an idea, originally, that we thought was just kind of a funny joke amongst ourselves and when we finally really thought about it, we said, "Well, gee, why not?
Why don't we use it?" -And we did.
I always wish we had a full recording on the album of them doing that whole song, -'cause I love that song.
They were amazing.
I can't hear you, buddy.
Back me up.
A-wiiiiii iiiiii-iiiiii-iiii A-Pumbaa-bum-baa-weh Pumbaa?
Pumbaa?
Hmm?
A little… Oh, Carmen there, I think… I love that little musical section of him sneaking up.
Timon?
Here's a little rack focus.
Digitally, in the CAP system, you're able to have a soft, diffused distant ground and a very sharp foreground, and at one point in the scene you just change those perspectives, and the foreground goes soft, and the background goes crisp, and you get the feeling that you actually moved the camera lens into focus.
I think it's interesting at this point also in just what kinds of techniques we're using.
That we're trying not to be limited by the vocabulary of animation of what we've typically been able to do, but try to go beyond that to do things that maybe you've seen in live action, but have never seen done in animation.
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm here for you.
I love all of this fighting stuff. -Ruben Aquino… Tony de Rosa. …and Tony de Rosa did these great fighting lions.
Just gorgeous.
See, I told you he'd come in handy.
The flip, the Nala flip.
Of course, here is the Nala flip.
The flip which we saw earlier in the movie returns again.
This is the lovely Moira Kelly, and she is lovely, too.
Actually, it's interesting, I remember the first time we had written this scene, the very first pass of the scene was written in New York, in that hotel, up on the top floor.
Yeah, at the beautiful Royalton Hotel in New York City.
Yeah, we had booked a recording session with Nathan and Ernie, and we had some script pages that were written well before the recording session, and on the plane on the way out, we got to thinking, and then the night before over drinks, we got to talking.
And then I found myself about 3:00 in the morning on the telephone to all these typewriter rental places saying, "Can you get a computer up to room 336, please?" And the next morning we had a 10:00 recording session.
We were together having breakfast at 8:00, pounding out script pages 'cause we had some new ideas.
And we ran them over to the stage, and it ended up eventually being this scene.
That was a very early session, too.
That was very early on.
I also think, this was one of the most difficult writing moments to arrive at.
Because we wrote this scene many, many times.
And boarded it many times because so many things had to happen in this little three-minute scene.
Simba and Nala meet, Pumbaa and Timon don't know who she is.
Their lives together as bachelors are threatened by her.
She punches Simba's buttons and says, "Why haven't you gone home?" And yet they can't completely break up because there's a love song coming up.
There's all these masters that scene had to serve.
And it was one of the toughest, just in terms of storytelling and writing, to do it in a compact, clear way for the audience to understand.
During this whole confrontational scene with Nala, where she's saying, "What about your family back home?" And all this sort of thing, and the comic characters saying, "You're the king!" We decided we wanted to ease from the afternoon colors, the golden light to a pinker light, to introduce… Because we wanted to do the love song against the last afternoon light so we can start off brilliant and go into sunset colors.
So, behind the background, again, we did a step by step warm pinkyfying of the backgrounds.
That had to be planned out extensively.
Here's Pumbaa and Timon, the buddies are going to break up.
Actually, I remember their walk off.
We had another line when they were walking off.
Timon and Pumbaa?
Yeah, Timon and Pumbaa.
What was the line that led into it?
Something about… Pumbaa said, "After all, he's the king!" Timon said, "What are we, the short subjects?" -Anyway… Which got left behind -for obvious reasons.
For obvious reasons.
I get it.
I've really missed you.
I've missed you, too.
I tell you, Pumbaa.
This stinks.
Oh, sorry.
Not you!
Them!
This is Jamie Lopez's animation of these two guys.
Great.
This song has an interesting, perhaps, the most diverse history in the film.
Poor Tim Rice, 18 times, I would bet you, no joke, he wrote the lyrics to this song, trying a bunch of different ways.
At times we had Simba and Nala sing the whole thing, with their mouths open onscreen.
At times we had Pumbaa and Timon sing the whole song, which was really funny, in fact, we took that version to screen it for Elton and Tim at one point, and everybody sat around scratching their heads, "and Elton said," Well, wait a minute.
You don't understand." "I always loved the point in Disney movies" "when the prince and the princess" "got to sing about how they feel about each other." "I always wrote this song, thinking" "it was gonna be a classic Disney love song." And so, we ended up with this kind of hybrid moment that it is in the movie now, where Pumbaa and Timon get you into and out of the song, and then you get a wonderful lyric from Tim Rice about how the two of them are getting together.
One of the things about doing a love song is you've got to put in some comic moments, or else a lot of kids start getting really squirmy.
So, it was a good thing that we held on to Timon and Pumbaa.
I love this.
This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, I just love the way it looks.
The reflections and everything.
I'm so happy with that.
Yeah, it's really great.
Without having to have a big, action-adventure sequence, you can use the artistry of the CAP system, the animators, the effects animators, the art directors, all come together to create a nice little moment.
Now, a lot of this also came from Andy Gaskill's storyboarding, the whole ideas of pulling Nala in the water, all this sort of thing.
Simba soaked to the skin.
Coming up is perhaps the most steamy love scene -in any Disney film ever.
Well, it's funny, in context of these lions in Africa, in an animated film, you actually, you know, feel the moment very much, right here, where they roll down the hill.
And then she has her "come hither" look in a minute.
There she is.
Wow, what a cat.
Yeah.
That's actually another classic animation scene. -The girl with the stars in her eyes.
Very sweet.
And I love this 'cause it's all one shot, and it ends up with these big, funny, cartoon elephant tears.
But the funniest thing about this is that the animators animated the crying to each other… -Each other's character's voice.
Yeah.
Cartoon trivia there.
His carefree days With us are history In short, our pal ls doomed We originally designed… You could see water underneath the log, and the reflections, and we had to cut back, so what Andy suggested is just drop the water out and make it a long waterfall -that falls off, which was even better.
It's beautiful, and this is a real tribute to the effects animators, too, to be able to create this whole mood in this little glen here.
This is the big continuation of that idea of the scene where Nala and Simba are… They're having their big confrontation about whether or not he is the king, and whether he should take responsibility for it, which of course we had to interrupt with the love song.
Right.
That's right.
That was what was difficult actually about the love song, because some ways, it was hard to hold off this moment from early on, because it took them a long time to get down to talking about this.
This is a great scene that portrays what great actors can do.
Matthew Broderick of course, playing adult Simba, and Moira Kelly playing adult Nala here.
And also, in our process they probably recorded these scenes at different times, on different coasts, and it's a tribute, too, to the film editor who has to sit down, in this case Tom Finan, and make this performance sound like it's one cohesive scene.
A lot of times when you'll be recording with another actor, one of us would have to go in, like either Rob or me, or Brenda, our story person.
We'd have to remember how the other actor had read the lines, and would play the scene opposite the person, so that you could keep them responding to the way the other actor had performed.
Matthew brought a lot to the role of Simba because I think in the casting process, we were trying to find somebody who could bring a comedic side to the character so he wasn't just a boring hero that was going on this journey, and he was kind of one-note.
And Matthew could bring that kind of wry sense of humor that he has, that kind of Ferris Bueller side of him, to the role and still carry the dramatic parts, because he is such a great actor.
This is the star metaphor coming back.
Ruben Aquino did some great animation here.
Ruben was the lead animator on the Simba character and was one of the earliest animators on the film and kind of set the style for how these lions would look.
And this is kind of Simba's dark day of the soul.
And an interesting anecdote here, the sobbing you hear at the end of here is actually director Rob Minkoff sobbing.
Asante Sana, squash banana We we nugu, imi mi apana Asante Sana, squash banana We we nugu, imi mi apana Asante Sana, squash banana One of my favorite scenes is the down-shot of Rafiki's point of view, with Simba walking away through the grassy field, and he leaves this really subtle little trail through the grass.
And it's so nice.
It's a special effect that the audience would never know, but you would feel it if it wasn't there and it's really tastefully handled.
And then when you get to this section where he walks out on the log and kind of looks at his reflection in the water, you get all that great moiré pattern of the water playing underneath the log, and it's really a wonderful moment.
This "Asante Sana" thing came from our guide in Africa.
It's kind of a little schoolyard chant.
It actually means something. "It means," Thank you very much, squashed banana. "You're a baboon and I'm not." Which, of course, Rafiki does explain in the movie.
A little bit.
It's interesting actually, because we took that "Asante Sana" idea, that was one of the very first things that we talked about, once we knew we wanted to make Rafiki this crazy shaman character.
And originally we had him using that in the blessing of Simba at the beginning of the movie, as a sort of quasi-chant.
Asante Sana Squash banana And it sounded a little goofy.
Yeah.
So, we said, "You know, that's not gonna work." But we ended up using it in this location, which made a lot more sense to do it to literally be annoying.
I think these scenes of Rafiki are great.
James Baxter is the animator of Rafiki and one of the great animators at the studio.
He really is.
It's interesting 'cause James animated Belle, in Beauty and the Beast, and he animated Roger Rabbit.
It's interesting because animators can crawl into the skin of so many different characters, so for somebody to animate Belle and to turn around and animate Rafiki, it shows you the kind of vast range that animators can have, and certainly James is amongst the best.
Okay, so this is Simba going into… It's interesting 'cause what we talked about is this whole twisted, gnarled vine area was sort of to reflect Simba's unconscious mind that he was literally going back, peeling through the layers, weaving through to go back, to get to, sort of, -the center of his problem.
Right.
Where he had buried and suppressed that whole thing about his father.
So he's going through therapy.
To counterpoint to the scene earlier when he was cub, when he was actually escaping from his homeland through the thorns and the thicket, this is the beginning of his journey back.
In fact, we actually… I had Ruben Aquino and Tom Bancroft, they had to mimic each other's scene, so it is literally this… One of the scenes is exactly the same. -That there's a vine… The crawling under… Yeah, there's a crawling under one big vine, -which is exactly the same.
Very interesting.
But done in different directions.
Leading into this wonderful Mufasa's ghost sequence, which was one of the first storyboard on the film.
I remember looking at Andy Gaskill and Chris Sanders and Brenda Chapman kind of collaborate on this whole area and found a piece of music that kind of expressed the emotion here.
I love this scene.
That is based right on one of Chris Sanders' story sketches.
I like the moiré patterns of the water reflecting up… It's very poetic stuff. "Look down there." You see?
And again it's great special effects animation, in a very subtle way, from Scott Santoro and the gang.
Simba.
The Mufasa's ghost scene started with Tony Fucile, the lead animator on Mufasa, drawing the performance to James Earl Jones's voice in a really rough manner, and then that went to the effects guys, and Scott Santoro and Ed Coffey and a lot of the effects animators then took those roughs and turned them into cloud shapes and negative shapes and elements that were combined together to create that effect.
Yeah, also, what we were trying to do with the ghost scene was to bring Mufasa in as a negative shape and then slowly transition, so that the lighting effects would come around to the front, and eventually describe him as a three-dimensional form, up until the sort of climactic scene where you finally see Mufasa in a more dimensional, real state.
You know, we recorded James Earl Jones in a really interesting way for this scene.
Because his voice is such an instrument, a musical instrument.
And our sound designer got an idea to actually put microphones around his head.
We had about six microphones.
So, in a theater environment where you get a left-center-right surround kind of environment, we actually recorded him with five microphones around his head, which was quite a shot.
It was supposed to make it sound like his voice was coming -from inside of your head.
Right.
I remember sitting around in my office, late one night with a box of cold pizza, trying to figure out how to physicalize this scene, and how to turn it into a moment that wasn't just talking heads.
And that's where the idea of bopping Simba on the head with a stick came out of There you go.
That's the whole movie. "It doesn't matter." Right, in those two lines. "It's in the past." And it's funny, after previewing it, we actually opened up a little after that line, because the audiences would just roar with… Particularly the adults.
It was just a real knowing laugh.
It's like, "Yeah, that's how life is." And so, we ended up adding more animation there because it stepped on all the rest of the lines.
And even as much as we added in a lot of the earlier test screenings, you still missed a lot of lines after there.
Big African chorus.
And great twinkling stars, just little subtle twinkling stars, and these little comets, these little shooting stars coming in.
This is another one of my favorite scenes.
It's just a fun… "Who's the monkey?" scene. "Who's the monkey?" scene.
Really fun, kind of fast-talking, Howard Hawks-y, '40s detective movie dialog.
Well, it's an old style of the comedy of errors. -It's a mix-up… Yes, exactly.
It's like Who's on First?
Who's on First?
With warthogs.
Actually, Simba was in this scene in the beginning.
In earlier stages, then we took him out, we had him leave.
So, in the "Who's the monkey?" scene, originally, it ended with Pumbaa giving a speech.
Timon was left behind, Simba had gone off, Nala had gone off, and Pumbaa was gonna go off and Timon was aghast.
And we had Pumbaa deliver this wonderful, patriotic speech. "Timon, it's about responsibility." And he went into this rousing Winston Churchill speech, and we played a little patriotic music behind it, and it was a wonderful little scene, but it's not there anymore.
Oh.
You know, David Lean made movies that had scale to them.
And I think we wanted to have that big African viewpoint be part of these movies, and you see that here in a few very simple shots.
The great imagery of Simba's heroic journey back without a bit of dialog, just a wonderful feeling of Africa and music.
Originally, there were several traveling shots we just combined, we eliminated a lot and just combined two into that one scene.
This is kind of like the… Simba coming back to his hometown, but all the buildings are burned out, the old house where he grew up is all derelict now.
It's kind of an apocalyptic vision is basically what this is.
Well, it's post-apocalyptic.
And again in a scene like this the music carries a lot of the emotional message.
Of course, we had to explain how the hyenas caused the drought, you know.
Well, metaphorically speaking… It's a symbolic thing.
A King Arthur type metaphor, you might say.
Precisely.
With the good king, comes the good weather.
With the bad king… What is it?
That the king restoreth the land.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
When the king is removed from the land, the land dies, it withers.
I remember these layouts were problematic because, early on, they didn't have many burned-out trees, and yet there's this huge fire sequence at the end of the film.
We were wondering, "What the heck is burning here?" "Is Pride Rock made out of coal or something?" I see nothing funny about this.
Timon!
Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?
At your service, my liege.
Aww!
We're gonna fight your uncle for this?
Yes, Timon.
It's a good sort of colloquial gag. -A fixer-upper.
Real estate gag, yeah.
We generally try to keep it a little bit timeless and non-specific to the contemporary life, but we couldn't resist that joke.
We've got some more moving clouds.
Oh, yeah, the clouds are moving from here on.
Well, this, originally, what's coming up, was just a little soft shoe, "and we thought," No, it's too tame. "What can we come up with that's funnier than a soft shoe?" Basically, we sat in a room… This was also another late-at-night meeting.
But we sat in a room and I think Don said, "Hey, let's do a luau." "What a great idea." We used the Hawaiian war chant, and we got together with the writers, Irene wrote a pass of lyrics to that song, and then when we got ready to pitch the song, that was the best part.
We were really worried about it… I brought in my ukulele. 'Cause I have a ukulele.
Which is, you know, not normal.
But I have a ukulele, I brought it in to work, and found a guy who knew how to play it and knew the Hawaiian war chant, so we brought him into the pitch, and at the appropriate moment, he was supposed to leap up with the ukulele in hand and started strumming, as Don Hahn leapt over to the Sparkletts water bottle to begin tapping out the rhythm of the song.
I was gonna do the Timon part, and Roger was gonna do Pumbaa's part… And we did this pitch and by the end of it, they were rolling.
They were busting a gut.
This is kind of Sarabi walking the gauntlet.
He sees Mom.
Russ Edmonds did Sarabi.
Andreas did Scar.
We constructed an interesting beat in the story to sort of convey a lot of information, to allow us to have Simba come in to the scene as an aggressor, which he wouldn't do normally because there's no reason for him to necessarily attack Scar immediately.
He's only heard hearsay from Nala that Scar's done wrong.
So Scar ends up hitting Sarabi to sort of justify why Simba can actually come in on the attack.
Mufasa?
No, you're dead.
You notice the whiskers on Simba?
You know, all those whiskers had to be drawn -on a separate piece of paper.
That's right.
Because they had to be colored separately from the rest of the character.
And originally we were gonna have whiskers on the lionesses, too.
But we didn't.
But we didn't.
It doesn't matter.
I'm home.
I like this 'cause Scar kind of is crazy now.
He's going mad.
If you're doing a scene, for example, at the end of the picture, where the hyenas are lit up by lightning, so you're not seeing the physical lightning, but you're seeing the effects of it, the way the light affects the rock, the only piece of artwork that's drawn is a shadow.
Is actually one still frame of the shadow. -And the light setting of the piece… And the tone… The tone on the character… Okay, the shadowed side of the character, plus the cast shadow on the rock.
And you're literally dialing up and down the settings so that the light gets brighter and dimmer.
But that's the only extra piece of artwork you've got in a scene like that.
It's nice.
The sound effects kind of play in here, too, 'cause you see the clouds encroaching and then you hear… You begin to hear the thunder coming in the surrounds, and then by the time you're into the fight, the lightning storm's right on top of you, so it punctuates the fight.
And this whole little section was kind of courtroom drama-like.
I think that was the conceit when it was laid out.
Simba on trial.
Simba on trial, you have a jury. -Scar plays the judge here… No, Scar's F.
Lee Bailey.
F.
Lee Bailey pacing up and down, grilling him about where he was.
It's not true.
Tell me it's not true.
It's true.
You see?
He admits it!
Murderer!
This scene is actually done with two flat backgrounds, or rather a background and a foreground element, and the characters are literally animated to be turning in place.
To simulate a camera move that swings the camera 360 degrees around the characters. …and now everyone knows why!
Now, this scene is interesting 'cause, like many other moments in the film, it sets up a parallel to exactly the geography and the scenes where Mufasa and Scar were interacting back at the stampede.
In fact, the fire down below, the lightning's now set the whole Pride Lands ablaze, and the fire is moving left to right just like the wildebeest stampede was moving left to right, so you create a lot of visual imagery about the relationship between Scar and Simba, much like the imagery between Scar and Mufasa earlier, and now a very literal flashback to that moment.
And the art direction's gone completely mad here.
It's turned completely red.
Actually, what's interesting about this sequence is that, typically, the climactic sequence takes the longest to resolve, in terms of story.
It begins at the very beginning, but until you've worked out all the beats and story points throughout the whole course of the movie, you don't really know what it is you have to pay off, so this sequence went through more changes I think, probably, than any other sequence.
Took the longest to produce, too.
It was probably one of the last sequences to be finished.
Coming up is my favorite ninja-Rafiki moment.
Oh, yeah.
We spent a lot of time trying to get the right ninja sounds.
Robert Guillaume did some.
We had Pat Pinney come in, and other people to… We had some kung fu people.
Kung fu people to give us some nice ninja moments.
But it's also important in a sequence like this to have a pay-off, for each of the characters, so we tried to construct a comedy moment for each character.
It was fun to be able to put these guys together.
They hadn't been together for the whole film.
We had a much longer scene with these characters, once they got into the cave, which of course… We thought, "Wouldn't it be funny to put the three hyenas," "Pumbaa, Timon and Zazu, all in one high comedy scene." Right, and originally Pumbaa got them out of the scene, out of trouble, by resorting to flatulence.
Using his secret weapon!
His secret weapon!
And he cleared the cave, and then the last one out was Zazu.
Who said, "You should have let them kill me.
Oh!" A lot of this fire coming up is turbulence fire in the same method that creates the smoke.
Turbulence was discovered kind of as an accident, wasn't it?
It was like galvanized rubber, you know.
They were looking at a monitor one day and these interesting patterns were appearing, and they kind of got into it and found, "Oh, this is an effect." "This is something we can actually harness and use in our movies." Randy Fullmer was really instrumental in pulling these things together, when we were putting together the fight against the fire, against the fire background, where all of a sudden one of the things came back wrong.
It was just absolutely weird, the colors were all blown out, but we all looked at it and said, "Now, there's something interesting about this." It had kind of a flame-like look.
So Randy researched where the problem came from, and we actually wound up using it for flame effects in the climax.
Basically, they would design a block, a literal sort of marbled cake, if you will, that slices would be taken through and photographed, and as each slice was removed, you would see a differing image of that turbulence.
So the shapes morph and modulate from one to the next, so it gives you the feeling of just a random and organic pattern.
The embers is a really cool computer trick where the CGI guys create these little embers that actually turn in space and are very dimensional, so on the big screen they look quite real and they glow hot.
And then you have levels of churning smoke behind, which is a combination of drawn artwork and turbulence and diffusion put over the top of it, to really create the inferno feeling down below.
This was sort of an interesting experiment, trying to achieve that kind of slow motion effect that, again, you can do in live action.
And we had to simulate that by literally dissolving from one frame to the next.
And that scene where he kicks him off, there's an inter-cut of about eight frames or so. -Eleven frames.
Yeah.
Of Simba kind of gritting his teeth before he kicks him off.
Exactly, that's right, that's the one that we added.
It was the very last scene that we animated… It was added, like, a month before the movie came out.
We previewed it and it just seemed like something was missing.
And it was a conscious expression on Simba's face, he was gonna kick this guy's butt.
And that was a little eight-frame scene that was lodged in there, and kind of cemented that section of the movie.
That's what I heard.
Ed?
I always liked that we had Scar done in by his minions, you know.
He was foisted on his own… Hoisted on his own petard.
A Shakespeare thing.
And then the rains came.
All of this heavy, heavy effects work going on in here.
Glowing embers, rain, fog.
There's Zazu saying a line, which… Says, "Your majesty." Which then we took out because we wanted it to be silent.
Yeah, it kind of broke the magic of the moment, but… You can play it back and go… If you want to.
If you like to lip sync along at home you can say, "Your Majesty," along with Zazu right there.
Here's Rafiki pointing to the throne.
I always saw this as kind of the Arthur-Merlin moment.
It is time.
Actually, I think we have a Don Hahn scene.
Roger and Rob, and even Don… Don, that's right. …have animated scenes in this film.
It's our Alfred Hitchcock turn.
It's the close-up of Simba's feet walking up.
And there it is.
There it is.
Thank you, everyone.
There was a whole another ending of the movie.
Yeah, where Timon and Pumbaa brought the baby bugs and… They had a nice little birthday present for the new little cub, and it was a little bug.
It was the same general concept, just done differently.
Right, it was the goop on the forehead from Rafiki and all that.
We thought we needed another comedy pay-off for each of the characters.
And it was just too long.
It was too tedious, and we felt like, "Let's go out in a big way," and we came up with the idea of, "Let's end it like we've cut back in after all the ceremony" "to the moment where everyone is cheering." It's a curtain call, almost.
Because, when Simba roars, that's the end of the movie, -and you're going for your handbag.
That's right.
It's also nice to get that little curtain call of the characters standing out there on Pride Rock.
That was one of the reasons we changed it.
Because when we started, we started on the cub, and it wasn't clear who the parents were.
It wasn't clear which cub this was.
So to begin with Simba and Nala standing on the rock, and then introduce Rafiki and the cub… It also ended up with a wide shot of Pride Rock.
A lot like Circle of Life ended up.
You know, with the big establishing shot.
And that just seemed so right since you were intimate with their characters and all our heroes are there together to introduce the cub, to just say, "Let's end on the next generation. "And here's Fluffy, Simba's and Nala's new little cub. - "Let's just end on Fluffy." Right.
I was surprised, just looking at it again, how many callbacks there are, even little things like the way Pumbaa and Timon bust up the vultures is the same way they run in and bust up the lionesses and the hyenas.
And the way Mufasa and Sarabi are at the beginning, is the way Simba and Nala are at the end, and cub Simba running off to the jungles is the same as adult Simba coming back, and, you know, how many callbacks are in the movie to try and knit it together in that kind of circular theme.
Exactly.
It's interesting.
Yeah.
I also didn't realize, looking at it again, how much of an effects tour de force it is.
If you took out the effects animation, whether it be the shadows or the rain or the reflections, or the fire, it would be greatly diminished.
There's so many unsung heroes in the animation process, -and certainly… Absolutely.
The effects tell some of the story.
It's impossible to get around it.
I mean, Mufasa's ghost, reflections in the water, the Pride Lands ablaze, so much of it tells you information you need to know about what the context of the movie is.
It would be impossible to tell without it.
Yeah.
A lot of..
This is really… Animated films are about the process as much as anything else.
And there always comes a point where you have to finish, you have to end your relationship with any piece of this.
And every time you commit to it, every time it becomes sort of solidified, and you know, there's always a sense of is it all that it could be, could we have done something better with it?
And some pieces, of course, you feel, "You know, we succeeded pretty well." And of course, there's other pieces where you say, "You know, maybe we could have gone for it." It's tough.
It's knowing when to stop, because it's never about money either, it tends to be more about time, because the meter is ticking, the release date's set, you have a movie to turn out, and it's always in many cases, compromise.
And I think we were fortunate in a lot of cases not to have to compromise, and, again, people like Randy Fullmer and certainly Andy Gaskill, helped us craft a look of the movie that was pretty seamless.
They took us through places where we had to cut back because of time.
And found other solutions that would help us through it, that would soften the absence, you know.
Like, for example, if we couldn't do the certain effect in that one area, they'd come up with another solution that would be a simpler effect, and yet it would keep the production value up.
Their contribution is incredible.
So, you never had that sense where you're riding along the movie, and all of a sudden… It takes a production dip.
There was a lot of creative monkeying going on back there, in those colored model stations.
That's a really good point.
Well, it's interesting because a lot of people think our characters and a lot of our films are created by computer, but nothing could be further than the truth.
Because it's artists who have always driven these movies and certainly who have made Lion King.
So, in a way, animation's still created the old-fashioned way where somebody sits down at a drawing board with a pencil or a paint brush and draws or paints animation or a background by hand.
We use computers then heavily in the post-production process to sandwich all those hand-done elements together to create the final frames.
And we also use computers in an area called CGI, or computer graphics imagery, to animate or create things on a screen that you couldn't possibly do by hand like the wildebeest stampede.
And the other thing I find interesting, too, is, we were talking about how around the world these movies are put together, that you literally have lines that cut together or pieces of song that cut together, where one word was sung in New York, another was done in Los Angeles, the chorus was recorded in London, and the music was done in Santa Monica.
You know, it's spread out all over the place, and somehow that all comes together into one piece.
It's the magic of animation.
It is magical.
In fact, one of the big questions that we're always asked is, "How do you direct an animated film?" And the thing is rather than in a live action film where you have all of your elements together at one moment to work with, to put them all on film, in animation you're literally picking up elements scattered from all sorts of different places.
And you're taking all the bits and pieces of the puzzle and putting them together, and as a director that's pretty much what your job is.
Managing, designing, juggling all the pieces of the puzzle so that when it does come together, it makes sense and means something.
And that about sums it up, in the Circle of Life.
Good night, Gracie.
Thanks for inviting us into your living room.
The popcorn was great.
Hope you enjoyed the movie.
Hakuna Matata Hakuna matata Hakuna matata Hakuna matata Hakuna… Thank you, everybody.
We'll be here all week.
Thanks.
Good night, everybody.
Okay.
My turn, my turn.
I got one.
Great, but can you make it a little more challenging this time?
Okay.
Check this out.
I spy with my little eye... something yellow... and round, and it eats dots.
Seriously, Ralph?
Yeah, seriously.
You're never gonna get it.
Well, obviously, it's Pac-Man.
No, that's not...
Why is that obvious?
Name one other thing in this whole arcade that is yellow and round and eats dots.
I can name two things.
Ms.
Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man.
Boom!
I accept your apology.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay.
But was it Pac-Man?
Yeah, you got me.
Knew it.
All right, riddle me this... do you or do you not think that Zangief waxes?
No way.
Look at the guy.
He looks like a yeti.
I don't know.
I mean, if the fur were confined to his chest, I might agree... but look at those two very specific tuffets of shin hair... poking out of his boots.
That does not just happen, Ralph.
That is a choice.
You're totally right, kid.
He's baby smooth everywhere else.
I rest my case.
My mind is blown!
Let's go get a root beer.
Okay, let's see what you got, kid.
Nice one.
Okay.
I think I got one in the chamber.
Gross.
Thank you.
Hey, wanna sneak into Tron?
Doesn't that game have a virus?
No.
I'm sure they fixed it.
I'm gonna beat my speed record!
Hey, wait for me!
Ralph.
Yeah?
I don't think they fixed the game.
No.
Help!
Hey, Tron!
Tronny!
Tronny boy!
Help!
Do you realize we're basically just, like, zeroes and ones... floating around the universe like tiny specks of dust?
Like, doesn't the very nature of our existence make you wonder... if there's more to life than this?
Why would I wonder if there's more to life when the life I got is perfect?
I mean, sure.
Doesn't look so hot on paper.
I'm just a bad guy from some old video game who wrecks a building.
And yeah, for 27 years, I was a total zero without any friends.
But now, I got a best friend... who just happens to be the coolest kid in the whole arcade.
Aw, thanks, pal.
Watch this.
Home run!
All right, let's go watch the sunrise.
Are you really saying there's not one single, solitary thing... about your life that you would change?
Well, think about it.
You and me get to goof off all night long.
Litwak shows up, we go to work, we put in our hours.
Then the arcade closes and we get to do it all over again.
The only thing I might do different in that scenario... would be not having to go to work.
Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.
Hey, where'd our sunrise go?
All right, let's get you plugged in.
That's a plug-in alert.
Litwak hasn't plugged in a new game in forever.
Let's go see what it is!
Yeah!
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Minor emergency.
Hey, Felix, Calhoun, what's getting plugged in?
Well, Ralph, Sonic thinks it's gonna be a new pinball machine.
What do you think, lady love?
I'll bet you a shiny nickel it's a blood pressure machine.
Kids love those things.
Please be a racing game.
Please be a racing game.
Please be a racing game. "Whiffee"?
Or, "Wifey"?
Well, it's either wiffle ball, or an arranged marriage game.
It's actually pronounced "Wi-Fi," Ralph.
Yeah, that's what I said.
And Wi-Fi is the Internet... which is an online community where human beings go to shop... and play games and socialize.
Fun!
Oh, no, it is not.
That sign right there says "Wi-Fi." What it should say is "Die-Fi." That's a little humor there.
But seriously, the Internet is nothing to laugh at.
It is new, it is different, and therefore we should fear it.
So keep out, for Pete's sake, and get to work.
The arcade's about to open.
Figures, we finally get something new plugged in... and we're not even allowed to go in there.
Totally not fair.
A new racing game would've been cool.
Something wrong with your game?
No, no.
It's just every bonus level's been unlocked.
I know every shortcut.
Man, I'd kill for even just a new track.
New track?
You already got, like, three choices.
Yeah, I know, but don't you ever wish something new and different... would happen in your game?
Nope.
Really?
Well, agree to disagree.
Wait, I don't wanna disagree.
No, no.
It's just a fancy way to say we don't have to argue about it.
We're arguing?
I don't wanna argue.
Relax.
Stop making it a thing.
Go to work.
I'll see you tonight, stench vessel.
All right.
She wants a new track, I'll give her a new track.
Come on, Nafisa!
Let's play Sugar Rush!
Pick Vanellope, Swati.
She's got the best superpower.
Yeah, the glitch.
I love her.
Drivers, start your engines.
You're gonna lose today, Princess.
While, yes, I am technically a princess, Taffyta...
I'd rather you just think of me as plain old Vanellope... the racer who's about to kick your butt.
Three, two, one, go!
And pardon me, excuse me, coming through.
And one, two, three gumballs right on cue.
Yeah, I love it when she glitches.
Excuse me.
I must have fallen asleep.
Oh, fun.
I'm winning.
Vanellope takes a huge lead.
No one's gonna catch her now.
She's gonna love this.
Right on time.
What? "Looking for something new... "and different? "Then take this track." Ralph, you old son-of-a-gun.
I'd say I got a little time for a detour.
Hey, look, I think I unlocked a new track.
Never seen that before.
This is awesome!
Hey, thanks, Ralph!
You're welcome!
Get back up on the track, Swati.
You're going to lose.
I can't.
It's like it's driving itself.
What is wrong with this thing?
What?
No, no!
Kid!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Kid!
Kid!
Oh, kid, I'm so sorry, are you okay?
Oh, my gosh.
What an amazing track!
Thank you, Ralph!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're welcome!
You know I take my duty as your hero very seriously.
Wait a minute.
You took a serious doody where?
Vanellope, get up here.
We have a situation.
Mr.
Litwak, the Vanellope racer wasn't working... and I think maybe I turned the wheel too hard.
I'm real sorry.
It's okay, Swati.
I think I can get it back on there pretty easy.
What did you do, Ralph?
Nothing.
Leave him alone.
He was just trying to make the game more exciting.
Yeah, why don't you relax, Taffyta?
Litwak will fix it.
All right, on you...
Okay.
Still not a problem.
He'll just order a new part.
Well, I'd order a new part... but the company that made Sugar Rush went out of business years ago.
I can try to find one on the Internet.
Good idea.
Me too.
Good luck, that'll be like finding a needle in a...
I found one!
On ebay!
Really?
How about that?
See?
Those kids have it under control.
They're just gonna get another wheel from the eboy.
Are you kidding me?
How much?
That's more than this game makes in a year.
I hate to say it, but my salvage guy is coming on Friday... and it might be time to sell Sugar Rush for parts.
Where's he going?
Litwak's gonna unplug the game.
Get out of here!
Go, scram, let's go, run!
Go, run, run, run, run!
Let's go!
Run!
Gangway!
Yeah, you heard him, gangway!
Stop it!
No running!
What are you people doing out of your game, for Peter's sake?
The arcade is open!
Sugar Rush is getting unplugged.
We're homeless!
Yeah, yeah, we're homeless!
Oh, what are we going to do?
Y'all, calm down, calm down.
Get a hold of yourselves.
I don't want to be gameless.
An unplugging.
Good Lord.
I haven't seen this many gameless characters since Space Invaders went down.
Where are we gonna live?
Well, you can stay here until the arcade closes, I guess... and then we'll figure out where the heck we're gonna put you all.
Okay.
Here we go.
I raided Gene's fridge.
Good news, he's got pie.
Took a bunch of his pillows and junk, too.
I'm thinking we make a fort up here, or like a yurt.
Or we could take these pillows...
If we stack them right, we can make an igloo out of pillows.
Like a pillow igloo.
Pigloo.
Pigloo!
So what do you think, kid?
Fort, yurt, or the obvious best choice, pigloo?
I can't believe I don't have a game anymore.
I mean, like, what am I gonna do all day?
What?
Come on, are you kidding?
You sleep in, you do no work, then you go to Tapper's with me every night.
I've literally just described paradise.
But I loved my game.
Oh, come on.
You were just bellyaching about the tracks being too easy.
No, that doesn't mean I didn't love it.
Yeah, sure, it was kind of predictable... but still I never really knew what might happen in a race.
And it's that, it's that feeling, that not-knowing-what's-coming-next feeling.
That's the stuff.
That feels like life to me.
And if I'm not a racer, Ralph... what am I?
Well, you're my best friend.
That's not enough.
Hey.
No, I just...
I'm sorry, I know I'm being weird.
I think maybe I just need to be alone right now.
Okay.
I'll meet you over at Tapper's in a little while, I guess.
If you want.
All right, now... we found some good homes for so many of our chums from Sugar Rush... and we're just hoping a few more of you will open your doors... and your hearts to those in need.
Well, I suppose that large green olive will fit in nicely with my decor.
I'm a sour ball.
Well, beggars can't be choosers, can they?
Come along, condiment.
Mm-kay.
Marvelous.
That just leaves the racers.
We're, like, adorable.
You sure are.
So, any takers?
Anyone?
Felix, I know we've never once talked about having a family before, but...
I know, it feels like the kind of thing you just jump into with both feet... and nary a plan.
Felix and I will give them sanctuary.
Can I get a quick word with you two?
Look, I get it.
You've been married six years, you're looking to spice things up... but trust me, adopting 15 children is the wrong kind of spice.
Those things are basically feral.
Pardon me, sir, but those youngsters are lambs.
Lost little lambs in need of two kind, caring shepherds.
That's right.
Besides, how hard can parenting be?
You treat the child like your best friend... you give them everything they want... and you just love their little socks off.
Right, Tammy?
Darn-tootin'.
Come and get it.
Get your own candle.
Hey, Mom, why does your lame TV only have one channel?
Well, hate to say I told ya...
Hey, Tapper?
No, Ralph.
I haven't seen Vanellope.
Not since the last time you asked me 30 seconds ago.
Sorry.
I'm just worried about her.
She's glitching like crazy, and acting super insecure.
And get this, she said... being friends with me wasn't enough for her.
Not enough?
I'm a great friend!
Right, Tapper?
Right?
I'm sorry.
Who's acting insecure?
Ralph, come on.
The kid just lost her game.
Give her a break.
There you are...
Oh.
Hey, Ralph.
Hey, Felix.
Since when do you drink root beer?
Since tonight.
Yeah, I hear you, buddy.
Hey, listen.
This one was supposed to be for Vanellope.
I guess you can have it.
Doesn't look like she's coming.
Thanks.
You know, I can't help but think this whole mess is somehow... partially my fault.
It figures.
Just when my life was perfect.
Mine was, too.
But, hey, now I'm a father of 15.
Isn't that just a blessing?
Eeeee-oh-boy!
Wait.
What'd you say, Felix?
Isn't that just a blessing?
No, the weird sound thing.
Eeeee-oh-boy?
Yeah.
Sorry, say it again?
Eeeee-oh-boy.
Eeeee-oh-boy!
Eee-oh-boy!
Eee-boy!
Say it again?
Eeeee-oh-boy!
Eeeee-oh-boy.
Eeeee-oh-boy... eboy! eboy! eboy! eboy? eboy? eboy.
Yeah.
What are you getting at there, Ralph?
That kid out in the arcade said there was a steering wheel part... on the Internet, it's something called eboy or... ebay!
That's it, it was ebay!
Ralph, are you thinking about going to the Internet and finding that part?
Getting that part's the only thing that's gonna fix the game... and that's the only thing that's gonna make Vanellope happy again.
And if Sugar Rush is fixed, all those lovable scamps living in my house... and destroying my sanity will have homes of their own again!
Ralph, this is an important mission.
A noble mission!
I will cover for you.
Thanks, pal.
Ralph, what about your tab?
You owe me for the root beer.
Oh, Felix is gonna cover for me.
Drinks on the house, everybody!
Felix is paying.
Eeeee-oh-boy.
Boo!
Ralph, what is wrong with you?
Start churning butter and put on your church shoes, little sister... 'cause we're about to blast off!
What are you even talking about?
We're going to the Internet.
What?
Yeah, to find the part to fix your game.
No way!
Yeah, I probably should've just said, "We're going to the Internet." We're going to the Internet!
Yeah, we are!
Hey, Surge, are we glad to see you.
We want to report some malfeasance over by the Whac-A-Mole.
Yeah, we saw some undesirables causing a real donnybrook over there.
Heck no.
Not on my watch.
Appreciate the tip.
So, all we gotta do is find this eboy place. ebay.
Right, ebay.
So we go there, get the steering wheel... we have it delivered to Litwak before Friday.
He'll fix your game.
Everything goes back to the way it was.
Boom!
Happily ever after.
This is a shockingly sound, well-thought-out idea for you, Ralph.
No offense.
I know.
And none taken.
Here it comes.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...
I give you the Internet!
The Internet is not nearly as impressive as how Sonic described it.
Yeah, I gotta admit, I'm underwhelmed.
Where do you think they keep their ebay?
Beats me.
Hello, anybody here?
Anyone?
Hello!
We're looking for ebay!
Did you hear that, kid?
Sweet echo.
Check this out.
Okay, connect to network.
Bingo.
Password is "high score" with a zero instead of an "o." Yes.
And we are online.
Ralph, look.
Cool.
Mood lighting.
That's a gremlin!
Stay away!
It's a gremlin!
It looks like a tiny Mr.
Litwak.
IP address 415-1037-483.
Cool!
Come on, Ralph, let's follow him!
Hey, wait for me!
Kid, come back!
Wait!
Hey!
Don't leave without me!
Vanellope!
I can't breathe.
I don't fit.
Kid!
Ralph!
Isn't this great?
No, it is not!
No, no, no.
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
Kid, I don't think we're in Litwak's anymore.
We most certainly are not, friendo.
We are in the Internet!
Come on, Ralph!
Holy cow!
Look at all this stuff.
This is the most beautiful miracle I've ever seen.
But it's so big.
It goes on forever and ever.
How are we possibly gonna find ebay out there?
Hey, kid.
Kid, don't worry.
I'm sure there's someone out here who could give us directions.
Look at that little egg guy.
He's got on one of those hats that smart people wear.
I bet he could help us.
Come on.

We're actually gonna save my game.
Told you not to worry.
We just gotta keep our eyes on the prize and stay focused.

Sorry, what's a credit card number?
A credit card number.

Don't.

We were so close, and we would have gotten...
Look, their signs aren't even real!
What the heck?
Dang Internet.
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.
Hey, kid.
What's going on?
What's wrong?
If I don't have a steering wheel, I don't have a game, I'm gameless.
There's only one steering wheel in the whole Internet... and we blew our chance to get it.

By the way, my name is JP Spamley... and I'd like to welcome the both of you to the Spamley family.
All right, step into my parlor.
This is your website?
I know what you're thinking, not to worry.
My anti-virus guy was just here.
Clean as a...
Dang it!
Oh, my gosh.
That's embarrassing.
Anyway, I know it's a bit of a mess...
Hey, Gord!
But I do have a system here, I really do.
If I can just find that...
Gord!
I just got to find this list.
There you are.
These guys are looking to get rich playing video games.
What do you got for them, partner?
Thank you. "Fishwife's amulet, Wizard Quest, three dollars." "Foxhole hammer, Zombie Crusades, five dollars"?
Now, those there are some of your more commonplace, low-dollar items.
Can you back up a sec, Mr.
Spamley?
You're saying if we find the Golden Cleats from Pro League Soccer... we find those and bring them back here to you... then a human being in the real world will pay us $15?
Yes, ma'am.
Welcome to the exciting world of loot hunting.
Folks go into games... they harvest the most coveted items... and they sell them on my website to the highest bidder.
Okay, but here's the thing... we need like a buttload of money.
So, do you have any more lucrative items, maybe?
Gord!
Gord!
There you are.
Thank you, buddy.
You're such a nice guy.
Is $40,000 lucrative enough for you?
It's more than enough.
I got a guy in Des Moines, Iowa... who will pay 40 grand for Shank's car... from a game called Slaughter Race.
A racing game?
That's right.
Slaughter Race is the most popular online racing game out there.
However, it is wicked dangerous.
We ain't afraid of danger.
This kid's the best racer in the whole world.
We'll get you that car, no problemo.
Slaughter Race!
Enter at your own risk.
Okay, this game is kind of amazing.
Meh, the attention to detail is pretty impressive.
I don't think I've ever been in a game with smog before.
Nice kitty.
Nice kitty.
Easy, boy.
Easy.
Let's just find Shank's car and get outta here.
Agreed.
Look.
Look.
There it is.
That car is gorgeous.
No wonder it's worth so much.
Aw, sugar.
Players.
They beat us to it. 31 hours of continuous gameplay... and we've finally found Shank's car.
Let's jack this ride.
Oh, yeah, DirtySocks, it's on.
Jim!
Jimmy?
You're not playing that horrible game again, are you?
No, Grandma!
I'm doing my homework.
Okay, like I said...
Let's jack this ride.
Well, well, well.
While the cat was away, these mice tried to play.
Hey, I think that might be Shank.
Listen up, mice... anyone who tries to play with this cat's ride is gonna get got.
You're going down, Shank.
Pyro.
Give those punks the works.
With pleasure.
End of the road!
Gosh dang it!
Now we gotta start all over.
Ralph, maybe...
Hey, where are you going?
I am scared.
If we get burned up in here, that's it, we're dead, we're gone.
So, I think we should get outta here right now.
No, wait, wait.
I have an idea.
Hey, Shank?
What's up, Pyro?
Do you ever reckon we're going a bit too hard on the players?
Honestly, no, I don't.
Of course, I have empathy for players like DirtySocks537 and BabeRaham_Linkin... but if we just let them win, where's the life lesson?
You know?
Yeah, but to Pyro's point...
I mean, those players work so hard to get here.
I hear you, Felony... but imagine a game without challenges.
The same predictable thing every single time... who wants that?
Shank's right.
I just saw a really insightful TED talk... and I can't really remember what the guy said.
It was more about how he made me feel.
But I think, ultimately, the point was...
I honor your journeys, guys.
And we honor yours, Butcher Boy.
Thank you.
Hey, Shank, did you ever wonder what it would be like... if someone actually did get your car?
Well, I know one thing... whoever does will have to be the best of the best.
Good day to you, madam.
Who are you?
I'm here from the Department of Noise.
And the thing is, we've been getting some complaints down at HQ.
Larry's the one who takes the calls.
Anyways, someone told Larry... that we've been hearing a lot of gun sounds and screaming sounds... and what-have-you.
That sort of thing.
This is nice.
Where have you been all my life?
So I came to check on things.
I'm sorry, who did you say you were again?
I'm Larry?
You said Larry took the call.
Good job, Larry!
Yeah, worked like a charm!
Are you kidding me?
Someone got Shank's car?
And I need yours.
Sorry.
I'm just gonna go.
This is the worst day of my life!
It's a shame we have to leave so soon.
This game is cool.
Just get us out of here so we can get this car to Spamley and get paid.
No problem.
Look at this guy coming in hot.
You mess with the bull, you get the horns, little girl!
You still have value, Butcher Boy.
Oh, no!
It's that Shank lady.
She looks upset.
Don't worry, I'll lose her.
Where are you going?
Kid, get back on the track.
I'm gonna lose my cookies.
There is no track.
I can drive anywhere.
Kid, she's coming up right behind us.
Oh, hello!
I believe you have something of mine.
Yeah, come and get it.
This girl can drive.
Would you hurry up and lose her?
I'm trying!
Hang on, chumbo!
I don't like this!
Mother Hubbard, this lady can really drive.
Kid, fire!
Do you see the fire?
Dead end!
Dead end!
Not for me.
Bye-bye, Shanky.
Yeah!
That's the stuff.
Good job, kid.
Oh, yeah, I feel like me again.
One exit straight ahead.
You're not gonna lose me that easy.
How did you...?
You might wanna keep your eyes on the road.
Kid!
Yo, Department of Noise, get out of my car!
Oh, man, what are we gonna do?
You just stay put, don't panic.
I'm gonna talk to her.
Ralph, be careful.
It's fine.
This is what heroes do.
My bottom is stuck.
This car is not designed for a big boy.
I'll tell you that.
Hi.
You guys really thought you could just steal my car?
Well, let me tell you what's gonna happen now.
No, wait, listen.
We aren't normally car thieves.
My friend here, she's a candy kart racer.
You should see her racing around her sweet little track... in her cookie wafer car we built together.
And, well, the thing is, her perfect little game broke... and it was my fault... so we're here to try to fix it... and we need money to do that, and someone was gonna pay us money... to steal your car, and so we took it.
Okay, okay.
You can stop crying.
Though I do respect your wonderful display of vulnerability.
Thank you.
I get it, I do.
Friendship is everything to us, too.
Right, guys?
Word.
We're like family.
That's really great.
So, does this mean we can keep your car?
Absolutely not.
But I do want to help.
Hey, you got your phone on you?
You know it.
Let's make a video.
Pyro, hit big boy with the blow and go.
I'd love to.
Wait.
What's the...?
What are you doing?
Say something, first thing that comes to your mind.
I'm gonna wreck it!
Good.
All right.
Turn it off.
What the heck did you do that for?
Yeah.
There are much better ways to make money on the Internet than stealing cars... such as becoming a BuzzzTube star.
Am I supposed to know what that is?
Oh, come on.
Everybody knows BuzzzTube.
It's the video-sharing site.
I'm just starting your account...
All right, there you go.
If this thing goes viral, you can make a lot of money.
A friend of mine, chick named Yesss... she's the head algorithm over there.
Tell her I sent you.
Yesss will hook you up.
Wow, that's really nice of you.
I'm not sure if "nice" is the right word.
Well, thank you.
I should be thanking you, little sister.
That race was fun.
Well, thank you again.
While we're talking shop, what move did you do to get through that tunnel of fire?
Was it a power drift into a drift jump, maybe, or...?
Maybe.
If you ever wanna come back for a rematch...
I'd be happy to kick your butt again.
See you.
Show-off.
Man, oh, man, that place was scary.
I know.
It was so exciting!
No, exciting is when you smile.
Scary is when you clench your butt, and my butt is still clenched.
Come on, are you honestly telling me... that Shank lady wasn't the coolest person you ever met?
Cool?
Name one cool thing about her.
Let's see, she looks cool, she talks cool... she drives cool, her hair is cool, her car is cool...
Wait a minute, are you saying my hair isn't cool?
What?
No!
I'm just saying the game was next-level.
There was no one telling you what to do or where to go.
Hey, just where do you think you're going?
To BuzzzTube.
It's this way.
No, no, no.
We're going back to Spamley's.
He can give us some easier loot to find.
No, we're supposed to see Shank's friend.
Come on.
I don't trust that Shank one bit.
Well, I do.
Well, I...
Hello, mister.
Who are you?
I'm your friendly ebay alert messenger.
An actual eboy.
Just here to let you know your bid expires in eight hours.
Eight hours.
Okay, thanks, eboy.
You got it, Jackson!
Chumbo, if we nickel-and-dime it with Spamley... it will take 20 years to make enough money to buy the wheel.
All right, fine.
We'll do it your way.
But I'm telling you right now, that BuzzzTube place is a terrible idea.
Man, there are all kinds of videos in here.
Yeah, if you like babies and cats.
Look, there's you!
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna wreck it!
I wonder why those little guys are giving your video all those hearts?
Because obviously they love me.
I told you this place was a good idea.
Yeah, sure you did, doof.
Now, who we supposed to see about getting paid again?
The head algorithm.
Her name is Yesss.
No.
No.
No.
Uninspired, clichéd...
YouTube's got this one.
Chewbacca Dad?
Really?
Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom, but it's a daddy.
No!
Heyo!
Are you the head of Al Gore?
I am the head algorithm of BuzzzTube... which means I curate the content... at the Internet's most popular video-sharing site.
Which means, I don't have time to trifle... with every shoeless, mouth-breathing hobo that trundles into my office.
Call security, Maybe.
Yes.
But, Yesss, this is the leaf blower guy.
Who?
The man with the undulating jowls.
So?
His video has 1.3 million hearts.
Well!
Why didn't you tell me I was in the presence of a genius?
Grab him a drink.
Yeah, this lady named Shank... she actually made the video.
She's the one who told us to come see you.
No wonder your video's so dope.
Shank is for real cool.
Right?
She is not.
I'm the cool one getting all the hearts.
Well, that's right, you big baby.
Yeah.
What'd you say your name was?
Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.
Well, Wreck-It Ralph, you are trending!
And these are for you.
Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.
Hearts, hearts, hearts!
Hearts, hearts, hearts!
Yes!
Hearts!
Not to buzzkill the lovefest you guys got going on here... but Shank kinda told us that viral videos can make, like, actual money?
Oh, hearts are money, honey.
Your Buzzzy account converts hearts into dollars.
Ka-ching! $43,000!
Kid, we only needed 27,001.
We're done.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's $43. 43?
That's not even half of 27,001.
And we only have eight hours left to save my game.
I hate to say it, but that ain't happening.
Your video is tapped out.
But I thought I was trenching?
Trending.
You were.
But that was 15 seconds ago.
Now, you're not.
Thanks for stopping by, though.
What are we gonna do, kid?
All right, pal, I have an idea.
And hear me out.
What if we go back to Slaughter Race and I ask Shank really...
No, no, no.
We're not going back to that death trap.
Yesss, what if I made you a whole bunch of videos... of me doing all kinds of them crazy things?
You mean saturate the market?
That could get you a lot of hearts fast.
Have you thought this through at all?
What do you plan on even doing in these videos?
I'll just copy whatever's popular.
Genius.
Yo, Maybe, what's trending right now?
Let's have a lookie-lookie.
As usual, human suffering is number one... followed by hot pepper eating challenges... video game walkthroughs... screaming goats are back... unboxings, cooking demos, makeup tutorials... and lastly, bee puns.
Let's "bee" friends.
Two weeks in a row, guys.
That's a fortnight of bee puns.
He won't be doing any bee puns.
They're beneath you.
Oh, I'm doing a bee pun.
Yes, I am.
And I'm eating a hot pepper, and I'm putting on makeup... and whatever else it takes!
Because, kid, we came here to save your game and we're gonna do it.
I love it!
That is what the Internet was made for!
Now, let's get to work.
Seen it.
Saw that one.
Seen it.
Seen it.
Yo, McNeely, you remember Wreck-It Ralph?
That bad guy from the old video game?
Yeah, exactly.
I'm gonna send you a super random video.
Check it out, dude.
Yeah, I'll give it a heart.
Whatever.
Hey, everybody, welcome to Up To the Meme-ent!
I'm your host, Dani Fernandez.
Nobody knows who's making them, but the whole world is going bonkers... over a series of truly bizarre videos... starring '80s-era bad guy Wreck-It Ralph.
Check out what everyone is buzzing about... over at BuzzzTube.com.
Hey, guys, Wreck-It Ralph here... with the ghost pepper challenge.
Supposed to be spicy.
We'll see about that.
That's not so...
Oh, it's very hot!
Make it stop!
Yo, McNeely, another one just dropped.
Check it out, dude.
Where are these things coming from?
Hey, Josey, did you see the pepper challenge?
Not yet.
I'm watching the one where he just smacks his lips.
It's disgusting.
You don't want any real hard lines.
You just want to blend that out there, like this...
And that, my friends, is how you achieve the perfect cat eye.
I always start with the hootnanny.
Shift it into a floss.
And now I finish with a hot Marat.
Follow along with me, and I'm gonna give this little cloud a little friend... in the form of a tree.
Everybody needs a friend.
Look at these guys.
Look at this one, sleeping under his ear.
You couch potatoes.
Wake up.
We've been baking at about 950 degrees now for six hours... so she should be ready.
Voilà!
Burnt pie!
Let's have a little whiff of this here.
My hair, my hair!
My hair!
This man is on fire.
Literal and figurative fire.
But he still needs 200 million hearts in the next five hours... or this beautiful child loses her game.
That's why I'm on to phase two... you, my elite Pop-Up Army.
I need you out there popping up... and getting clicks all over the Internet.
I'm talking Tumblr, Instagram, Mashable.
Be my pied pipers and lead that beautiful traffic to BuzzzTube... because Wreck-It Ralph needs his hearts.
Hey, mister!
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you, you.
You don't wanna miss this.
It's the latest Wreck-It Ralph video.
Click it.
Click it!
Man oh Manischewitz, that looks so fun.
Yesss, can I be a pop-up?
I don't know.
Can you be annoyingly aggressive?
I don't know.
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
Yes, you're perfect.
Here.
Thank you!
If you're going, I wanna go.
No, baby, you've got to stay here and be my movie star.
What?
No, no, no.
Me and the kid are like shoes and socks.
Or peanut butter and bacon.
One cannot exist without the other.
Go on, kid, tell her.
It's true.
In fact, it's so true that we will be fine if we're apart for a minute.
Come on, pal.
It's my game we're trying to save.
I just wanna get out there and be useful.
But without me?
What if you get lost?
You're just a kid.
And you're some mature adult?
Well, I'm bigger.
Don't be insecure, big fella.
She's not gonna get lost.
I promise.
She'll be in my personal web browser.
And your app comes with BuzzzFace... so you can keep in touch anywhere on the Internet.
See, I'll be fine.
I know, I just...
We haven't been apart in like six years.
I'm going to miss you.
You'll be fine, too.
The more hearts your videos get, the faster we'll get the wheel.
And then we can go home.
Look, we'll be celebrating at Tapper's this time tomorrow, buddy.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Bye!
Be careful, huh?
Don't be a dummy.
So where exactly are you sending her?
Since candy girl comes from an arcade game...
I'm thinking she'd be good in the gaming district.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Bad idea.
Those games are dangerous, and they rot your brain.
Why don't we send her somewhere a little more totally different than that... and nowhere near there?
Let's see.
Family Friendly Fansites.
That sounds safe, and she is technically a princess... so how about this one here with the sweet little pink castle?
I love it.
Okay, I'll redirect our newest pop-up to OhMyDisney.com.
Jeez Louise, this place is bonkers!
To infinity and beyond!
Come on.
Princesses and cartoon characters?
Lame.
Hey, easy there.
I mean, no offense or anything.
Well, time to get to work.
And for your final question. "My friends would describe me as?" "Smart, funny, kind, or brave." Kind, I guess?
Based on your answers, your princess BFF is Snow White!
I do believe our friendship will be the fairest of them all!
Hey, wanna meet my BFF?
It's Wreck-It Ralph.
Just click here to see his new video.
Thank you.
Yeah, in Captain America: The First Avenger...
Red Skull refers to Yggdrasil, the World Tree, Guardian of Wisdom and Fate.
Are we to believe, sir, that you are a descendant of that tree?
I am Groot.
Okay, okay.
Thank you very much.
What is Drax really like?
I am Groot.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Are you a conifer or a fruit-bearing tree?
Excuse me.
I'll take this one.
He is Groot, I am Vanellope, click here to meet Wreck-It Ralph.
This is almost too easy.
Hey, do you have a permit for that pop-up?
That's unauthorized clickbait.
You're coming with us, kid.
She's getting away.
This way.
Step aside, citizen.
Sorry, mister!
Hey, can't you read?
Cast members only!
I think she went down this way.
Come on.
Roger that.
Did you see a kid come through here?
She came running through here like a headless hen.
Any sign of her?
No, maybe she went down to the Air Bud pavilion.
Come on.
Let's check it out.
Hi!
Ladies, I can explain.
See, I'm a princess, too.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
Princess Vanellope Von Schweetz... of the Sugar Rush Von Schweetzes.
I'm sure you've heard of us.
It'd be embarrassing for you if you haven't.
What kind of a princess are you?
What kind?
Do you have magic hair?
No.
Magic hands?
No.
Do animals talk to you?
No.
Were you poisoned?
No!
Cursed?
No!
Kidnapped or enslaved?
No!
Are you guys okay?
Should I call the police?
Then I have to assume you made a deal with an underwater sea witch... where she took your voice in exchange for a pair of human legs?
No!
Good Lord, who would do that?
Have you ever had True Love's Kiss?
Ew!
Barf!
Do you have daddy issues?
I don't even have a mom.
Neither do we!
And now for the million-dollar question.
Do people assume all your problems got solved because a big strong man showed up?
Yes!
What is up with that?
She is a princess!
Who made your gown?
I've never seen anything quite like it.
This old thing?
I'd so love to have one of my own.
As would I.
Me too!
So cool.
Best outfit ever!
I want one too, you guys!
I'll get my mice on this.
So this is love.
All hail Princess Vanellope, the queen of comfy!
Yay, Vanellope!
Of all the thingamabobs in this entire world...
I never thought I'd get to wear a real... what's it called again?
Oh, yeah.
Shirt.
I once had a dream that I might wear a shirt...
Wait!
What's going on?
She's singing.
Yeah, but there was like music and a spotlight.
Wait, you all saw it too, right?
That's what happens when a princess sings about her dreams.
That's never happened to me.
I mean, not even once.
Why don't you give it a try?
What is it you really want?
Sing about that.
Okay.
Sure.
I could do that.
Let's see.
Oh, steering wheel Oh, steering wheel Oh, yes, I want a steering wheel Well, there is a lot to unpack here.
So, this steering wheel you sing of, that's a metaphor?
No, no, no, it's not a metaphor.
I literally want a steering wheel.
I think the issue is I was a little pitchy.
Maybe a little.
But sometimes your song can't start... until you go someplace to reflect.
What works for some of us... is finding a form of water and staring at it.
What?
Yes, I like to stare at a wishing well!
I stare at the ocean.
Horse trough.
Soap bubbles!
Wait, you're saying if I just stare at some water...
Important water.
Right.
Of course. "Important water." I stare at the important water... and somehow magically I'll start singing about my dream?
For sure.
Yeah, I don't think so, ladies, but thanks.
Five minutes, Princesses.
Another "Which Disney Princess Are You?" quizlet starts in five minutes.
Okay, thank you.
I guess it's back to the gowns, girls.
It was lovely to meet you, Vanellope.
And best of luck finding your song.
What did she just say?
We don't know.
We can't understand her.
She's from the other studio.
Hi, everybody.
Wreck-It Ralph here... with a little box I'm gonna open.
Let's see what we got here.
A "Pancake Milkshake Fun Set." Got a little heft to it.
Something wobbling around in there.
Wonder if we got the kitty or the bunny.
Let's open it up.
Open sesabees!
Man, who would've guessed a bee pun would be the thing to put us over the top?
That's the Internet for you.
All right, it is uploading.
Hey, mister!
Hi, eboy.
Just here to let you know your bid does expire in 30 minutes.
Thanks, little eboy.
You got it, chairman.
You hear that, Yesss?
We don't have a lot of time left.
Okay.
We just gotta...
No, no, no.
No!
Not you!
What?
Why are you angry at the lollipop?
What does that mean?
The file's not loading.
If this doesn't load, we're not gonna make it.
You don't have enough hearts.
Ralph, where are you going?
I'm going down to the floor to get some hearts.
Genius!
Good thinking.
Now someone get me tech support in here, stat!
Only one person.
Hey, guys, come and check out my video, you're gonna love it.
Right, right over here.
Yep, here we go.
What are you...
You guys!
A cat?
You're gonna like this better than some dusty old cat.
What?
Give me that hose, partner.
You know you love me, give me those hearts.
There we go.
Hey, folks, where are you going?
Give my video a heart.
That's it.
Let's see who's in here.
Hello?
Anybody in here?
What the heck is this place?
Some kind of libary? "Wreck-It Ralph is back." Hey, they're talking about me.
Gee whiz, the Internet is so positive. "Fix-It Felix, Jr. was my favorite game." Mine, too. "Ralph's videos stink." What? "So stupid." "Ralph is the worst." "I hate him." "He's so fat and ugly." "Just a worthless bum, alone on a pile of bricks." Yo, Ralph, you in here, dude?
Hey, I got to show you...
First rule of the Internet... do not read the comments.
I should have told you that.
Look.
This place can bring out the worst in some people... but you gotta ignore all this.
This isn't about you, Ralph.
It's about them.
I don't care.
It's fine.
People hated me my whole life for being the bad guy.
It's just a good reminder that this is the only heart that really matters.
Vanellope gave me this... and as long as she likes me...
I don't need anybody else.
And I sure don't need the Internet.
Hold on.
It's not all bad.
The Internet can also be a place... where you find a steering wheel at one website... and make enough money to buy it at another one.
Congratulations, Ralph.
You did it.
Wait, really?
Yes, check your Buzzzy account.
You needed 27K, you got over 30 grand!
Oh, my gosh!
This is great!
Thank you, Yesss.
I couldn't have done it without you!
That's really true.
Hey, eboy?
What do you need, ace?
Can you give me a ride?
Let's hop along, Cassidy.
Come on, song, come on.
I'm reflecting.
What is it that I want?
What is my quest?
What is my dream?
Well, ladies, I tried.
No song for this princess, I guess.
How does this thing work?
Hey, kid, can you see me?
Yeah!
Yeah, you're right there.
We did it!
We got the money!
No way, Ralph!
That's great!
I'm on my way to ebay right now with the eboy.
We're almost there, champ.
Good work, eboy.
Hey, meet me out in front of ebay in five minutes, okay?
Okay, I'll see you soon.
We're going home, kid!
Our lives can finally get back to normal.
Wow, I can't believe it.
I get to go home.
So, I guess that's it.
I guess I just wanted a steering wheel.
And now, I got it, so... whoo-hoo.
Slaughter Race?
What can it be that calls me to this place today?
This lawless car ballet?
What can it be?
Am I a baby pigeon sprouting wings to soar?
Was that a metaphor?
Hey, there's a dollar store Look!
I'm rhyming My spirits climbing As I'm called through this fog of mace To this place called Slaughter Race Welcome back Watch your head Hate to see you end up dead Let's get this party rollin' Is that appliance stolen?
We have Fallen wires Dumpster fires Creepy clowns And burning tires That great white in the sewer You'll be happy that you knew her Fin bump!
Dogs and cats, they sure taste great With a side of license plate Some find us deplorable Well, I think you're adorable We may be a motley crew But our hearts ring true And just for you, a face tattoo Slaughter Race My heart's in flight And wow, it's a blast Feels like my dreams are real at last No trace of a frown upon your face Flying so fast Setting the pace Living the life Loving the chase Now is the time Here is the place This Slaughter Race!
I know I should go But home feels so slow These roads are paved with dreams Happy dreams, not creepy clown dreams What would Ralph say If it turns out I stay?
In this place called Slaughter Race In this place called Slaughter Race That old, tired laptop moving at a sloth speed?
Bid on a new one today!
Do you wanna get rich playing video games?
Click here to...
Ralph.
Ralph!
Hey, there.
Hey, Spamley.
What's the good word, brother?
Well, the good word is I just paid for the steering wheel... and we are going home.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Hey, have you seen Vanellope anywhere?
Your little chum?
No, no, I haven't.
Hope she's not lost.
Let me try to reach her on this doohickey.
See over there?
Over that mountain?
Yeah.
That's the Sequoia Speedway.
It's gonna be unlocked next month.
Hey, what are you doing in that awful game with her?
I think the track will end... right over there.
Yo, it's gonna be so tight.
I love it.
Hey, can I tell you something that I don't think I could ever tell Ralph?
Of course.
I know it sounds crazy... but the second I walked into this game, it felt...
Well, it felt like home.
I mean, more than Sugar Rush ever did.
Oh, yeah?
How so? 'Cause it's like my dream.
It's full of weirdos... and the racing is super dangerous... and you never know what's gonna happen next.
I mean, back home, I know exactly what's gonna happen next... because Ralph's dream is to do the same thing every day.
Here's something I wish I'd learned years ago.
There is no law saying best friends have to have the same dreams.
You know?
Yeah.
You are a very wise person, Shank.
And a good friend, too.
Thank you.
Around here, peeps like to say, "Shank you." You know, after you go home and your life gets back to normal... you are always welcome here.
But that's the thing, I want this to be my normal.
I want this to be my life.
I can't go home now.
I just can't.
Wow.
You know, where I come from, that's called a kick in the face.
I can't believe it.
A straight-up donkey kick to the teeth.
She's supposed to be my best friend.
No, this can't be right.
No, she's been brainwashed.
That's what this is.
Because the Vanellope I know would never abandon me like that.
I gotta get her out of there now.
Hey, easy now, tiger.
I admire the impulse... but you charge in there like some white knight... she's liable to hold it against you.
So what?
I'm supposed to just let her stay in a game that's obviously bad for her?
Of course not.
Then how do I make her leave?
She thinks it's so cool and exciting in there.
Unless you know how I can make the game boring or...
Wait.
You know about viruses and stuff, right, Spamley?
Who's asking?
Back home, me and the kid used to goof off in this game called Tron.
But then it got a virus that made the motorbikes go slow... and then Vanellope stopped wanting to hang out in there.
So, is there a way to do something like that to Slaughter Race?
There's ways.
Follow me.
I got mothers' maiden names... social security numbers, PIN numbers...
Now, this area down here is what's called the Darknet.
A lot of shady characters hang out down here... so try to keep a low profile.
Gord!
There you are.
Now Gord here, he's dabbled in virus-making.
But his cousin, this guy we're gonna go see...
Double Dan, this dude is a virus-making machine.
Here we go.
Are you sure this is safe?
Is it safe?
Of course it is.
Just whatever you do, do not look at his little brother.
He has a little brother?
Double Dan!
Long time no see.
Who are you?
JP Spamley.
We met one time over at Friendster... which tells you it had to be a long time ago.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Are you looking at my brother?
No, sir.
Don't you look at my little brother.
No, I wasn't.
He's very self-conscious!
You?
What are you doing here?
The reason I came to your neck of the face...
I mean, there's a face in your neck.
I mean woods.
Neck of the woods.
The reason I'm here is 'cause I...
Well, I heard a little tumor, rumor...
I heard a rumor that you could give me a harmless virus kind of thing... that might be able to slow down the Slaughter Race game?
Oh, yeah.
My cousin Gordon told me that you wanted to crash it.
Crash it?
No!
No, no, no.
I don't want anyone getting hurt.
If there's a way to just...
I don't know... just make the cars go slow or something... so the game is boring... and my friend comes back home to me.
Allow me to introduce you to Arthur.
Easy there, boy.
He's keen.
Arthur's what I call an insecurity virus.
Means he looks for little flaws and weaknesses that make a program insecure.
You release him into that Slaughter Race game, Arthur will find some defect in the code.
Then he'll copy that defect and spread it all over the game... until everything becomes, quote, unquote, "boring"... just like you wanted.
Okay.
Just to be super clear here... no one gets hurt, right?
Are you stupid?
Well...
Because the only way anyone gets hurt... is if you are stupid.
All you have to do... is make sure the virus stays in Slaughter Race.
Right.
Don't be stupid.
Make sure it doesn't get out of Slaughter Race.
Goiter it.
Got it!
Got it.
Get out!
Thank you, you're a cyst face.
Out!
I mean, assistance.
Thank you for your cyst face...
Assistance.
Get out!
Goodbye!
Fiddlesticks!
Well, that's game.
Beginner's luck.
Come on, kid.
I know a hustle when I see one.
Player's on the way.
Thanks, Bob.
Let's roll!
Game faces on, guys.
Show time.
You ready for your first race?
Yeah.
I think so.
Hey, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.
Yeah, no, I know.
I'll be fine.
You didn't tell Ralph yet, did you?
Not exactly.
Come on, V.
He's your best friend.
You gotta let him know you're planning on staying here for a while.
I know.
But he's gonna get really upset.
Yeah, he might, but you guys... you'll talk, you'll work it out, you'll figure it out.
Yeah, but what if we don't?
What if his feelings get hurt so bad... he won't wanna be my friend anymore?
Look.
All friendships change... but the good ones... they get stronger because of it.
Shank, I hate to bother you... but the player is waiting.
I'm not gonna tell you what to do, kid.
It's your call.
Yeah, okay.
All right.
Let's race.
Scanning for insecurities.
Scanning for insecurities. "Precious Car-go." Deliver the car to Bert's Chop Shop... but watch out for Shank and her crew.
Power drift into a drift jump!
I saw it!
You're amazing!
Thank you.
Scanning for insecurities.
Looks like we're not finished.
Come on, V.
Ralph?
Okay.
Relax.
Relax!
I'll just call him after the race.
It'll be okay.
Ralph will be fine.
Insecurity detected.
Copying insecurity.
Distributing insecurity.
Distributing insecurity.
Distributing insecurity.
Distributing...
What is happening?
What's going on, Spamley?
The whole place is going crazy.
I thought that virus was just supposed to slow down her car.
It was.
It must've found something real unstable in there.
It's her glitch.
Game reboot begins in 60 seconds.
Hey, Ralph, you can't go in there.
They're gonna reboot the game... and anything that doesn't belong in there will be deleted.
Yeah and if I don't get her outta there, Vanellope's gonna die!
Come on, kid.
The game's crashing.
Let's go.
I think it's my glitch.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to destroy your game.
We'll be fine, but your code isn't part of this game.
We got to get you out of here now.
Follow me to the exit.
No, no!
Kid!
Kid, where are you?
The server is rebooting, Ralph.
Both of you have to get out of here now.
Kid, I got you.
I got you.
Game reboot... in five, four, three... two, one.
Reboot in progress.
Come on, Vanellope.
Wake up.
Come on.
Don't leave me, kid.
Ralph?
There you are.
You okay, kid?
Ralph, I messed up so bad.
No.
No, you didn't, it's okay.
This is all because of me and my glitch.
I should've just stayed with you... instead of following some stupid dream.
I've ruined everything.
No, kid, no.
Look.
I didn't mean for it to happen like this.
It was not supposed to be this bad.
You didn't mean for what to happen?
I mighta, kinda sorta put a... harmless little virus in the game.
A virus?
You did this?
I wouldn't have done anything if I hadn't heard you tell Shank... that you wanted to live in Slaughter Race forever.
So you were spying on me?
Hey.
You're not exactly innocent here.
You were gonna ditch everybody and abandon Sugar Rush.
Oh, please.
I'm one of 16 racers.
They'd never miss me.
What about me?
Why would I ever spend another second with you... after what you did?
No!
No.
Vanellope, where are you going?
Wherever you're not.
Wait a minute.
I can explain.
No!
You will not follow me.
Vanellope, please...
A friend would never do what you did.
Never!
So you leave me alone!
Vanellope, no, no, no!
Please!
Please!
What did I do?
Scanning for insecurities.
Vanellope, come on, don't leave me!
Insecurity detected.
Copying insecurity.
No, no, no.
Distributing insecurity.
Come on.
Where is it?
No.
You are such an idiot.
What is your problem, Ralph?
I told you, don't follow me.
Friend?
Cut that out.
You're scaring me.
Friend!
What the...?
Friend?
Friend!
Sweet mother of Ralph!
In breaking news, the Internet is under assault... as a massive denial-of-service attack... crashes servers across the web.
The Wreck-It Ralph virus is fast-moving and destructive.
Friend?
Friend?
Experts are still trying to understand who or what the virus's intended target may be.
Friend.
Friend.
Friend!
Friend!
I found 130 results for "Where does my high school girlfriend live now?" You're welcome.
Mr.
KnowsMore!
Oh, delightful!
You're that courteous little cherub who says "please" and "thank you." What can KnowsMore help you find today?
There's a whole...
Whole Foods, a hole in the ozone...
A Whole Lotta Love by British rockers Led Zeppelin?
No!
No!
There's a whole bunch of Ralphs chasing me.
Friend...
This would probably be an appropriate time for me to shutter my site.
How long you think before they get in here?
Precisely one second.
Hey, hey, hey!
It's me!
It's the real me!
Ralph?
My apologies.
I followed those things here.
I think they're looking for you, kid.
Yeah, you think?
What did you do?
I'm so sorry.
I don't how this happened.
Well, I think it's fairly obvious.
It happened because an insecurity virus cloned... all of your needy, clingy, self-destructive behavior.
The very behavior which left unchecked can destroy friendships... and in this particular case, the entire Internet!
KnowsMore!
You have all the answers.
Official query... what do I do if clones of me are trying to capture my friend?
Search.
I find two results for your query.
Either you put all the clones in therapy.
Not very realistic.
Or, the anti-virus district is surrounded by a gate made from security software.
If Vanellope could somehow lead all of the clones through the gate... they would be deleted all at once.
Sort of a co-dependent pied piper situation.
Wait.
We know a pied piper.
We do?
Yesss.
Who?
Yesss!
Yeah, but who is it?
Oh, you mean Yesss!
Thanks for your help, KnowsMore.
It's a bit of an empty gesture at this point, wouldn't you say?
Guess I forgot to tell Ralph that when you break the Internet... you don't literally have to break the Internet.
I can't believe he did this.
Yeah, well, I mean, dude obviously made some real questionable choices here.
But he also made a bee pun to save his best friend's game... so what can I say, kid, life's complicated.
You ready to pied the piper?
Yoo-hoo!
Up here!
It's me, your bestest friend in the whole wide world... who you can't live without!
Friend!
Wow, from up here I can see how I do come across as... needy, and clingy, and self-destructive like KnowsMore said.
Listen, kid...
I don't blame you for not wanting to be my friend anymore.
I never said I didn't want to be your friend.
I said you were acting like a bad friend.
Which you were.
I know I was, but I...
Hey, my babies!
That's the anti-virus district straight ahead.
All right, to be continued, okay?
We're gonna make it!
You guys okay?
I'm fine!
Yeah, all good.
Look, we can still do this.
Come on, big man.
Help me turn this thing over.
Uh, guys?
Friend?
That is unsettling.
Friend.
Get Vanellope out of here now.
What about you, Ralph?
Just go.
I got a date with the man in the mirror.
Hey, you!
You keep away from her!
I'm gonna wreck it!
She's not your friend!
She's my friend!
Here it is, this way.
Come on, kid.
We gotta move.
Eeeee-oh-boy!
No!
Vanellope!
Hey!
Let go of me!
Kid!
Ralph!
Hey!
Hey, get back here!
You put her down!
Vanellope!
You know, you're acting like a real bad guy here!
Well, you are!
And I will never be your friend!
Hey, doofus!
Ralph!
Catch me if you can, you big dummy!
I got you, little sister.
Now go!
Get out of here!
Ralph!
Go!
No!
Don't hurt him!
Please, no!
Stop it!
You're squishing him!
You're gonna kill my best friend!
Fine!
You win!
You win, okay?
Just please put him down.
I'll be your only friend, okay?
Just let him go.
No!
No, kid.
That's it.
That's it.
Yeah.
Put him down and I'll go with you... and we'll be best friends forever.
Just me and you.
That's what you want, right?
Well, that's not what I want!
It's not right to hold a friend back from her dreams!
You don't own her!
That's not how friendship works!
You need to let her go!
Hey.
You need to let her go.
I know.
It's gonna hurt a little bit when you do.
Who am I kidding?
It's gonna hurt a lot.
But you're gonna be okay.
And we're gonna be okay.
Right, kid?
Of course we are.
Always.
See?
No matter where she goes... or where she lives... she's always gonna be our friend.
And we just gotta trust her.
Because that's what best friends do.
Right?
Thanks, buddy.
Wow!
I feel good about this.
Ralph, look!
I think you fixed your insecurity!
You're right.
Ralph, no!
Park it right here, Ralph!
Your ol' pal JP Spamley's gotcha!
Wow, that didn't work.
Look up there!
It's a big strong man in need of rescuing.
Thanks, Frogger.
Wait a minute.
Who are all of you?
We're friends of Vanellope's.
Yeah, and any friend of Vanellope's is a friend of ours.
You're welcome.
Ralph!
Looking good, big fella!
Heyo!
This dress is not made for a big boy.
It's going right up the back alley there.
Let me just make a little adjustment.
There we go.
Internet users are breathing a collective sigh of relief tonight.
Just as mysteriously as it appeared, the Wreck-It Ralph virus has vanished.
You know what I just realized?
The sun never rises or sets here... because everything's always on.
Well, now, isn't that an astute observation?
I know, right?
You know, other than KnowsMore, I'm probably the smartest guy on the Internet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yo, V.
We're about to come back online.
You ready?
Be right there!
Hey, Ralph, don't be a stranger!
Well, I can't be much stranger than you, Shank.
That's a good dad joke.
Hey, don't forget.
You know Shank added my code and everything, so I'll be able to regenerate.
I'm gonna be totally safe.
No, I know.
It's gonna be great.
You found your dream game.
Yeah, I did.
I did.
So...
I guess I should probably head in there now, you know?
Before you go, I wanted to give you this.
I'm so sorry I broke it, Ralph.
No, no.
It's okay.
Now we can both have a half.
See?
Yeah!
I love you so much.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too, kid.
I really am.
All right.
Okay, getting a little clingy on me, here.
Go on.
Get out of here.
The world's waiting for you, kid.
I'll be honest, it still feels kind of weird around here.
I mean, a lot has changed.
Even though we got that steering wheel and saved Sugar Rush... it's never really gonna be the same.
For one thing, the racers aren't even that obnoxious anymore.
Oh, golly.
I'm sorry you didn't win, Taffyta.
Our friendship is much more important to me than winning, Rancis.
Losing builds character!
Everyone's a winner, Taffyta.
Felix and Calhoun, as goofy as they are, they turned out to be pretty great parents.
I gotta hand it to you two, how on earth did you tame those things?
It's simple, Surge.
The key to parenting is...
And then what you do is...
And that is the secret to raising perfect children.
Wow, I wish every parent could hear that.
I'm keeping busy, too.
I finally joined Zangief's book club.
Good point, Bison.
And how about you, Ralph?
Do you feel Dostoyevsky intended to make narrator unreliable?
I do and I don't.
You do, and you don't.
Duality.
That's really deep, Ralph.
Thanks, Sonic.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
And we got this new thing we do every Friday night... where we all go and hang out in a different game.
I actually hosted this week.
Heyo!
Hope you're all hungry.
I made burnt pie.
What's burnt pie, Wreck-It?
It's just a pie that you burn.
You can use any pie.
You just leave it in the oven too long.
Yeah, we really do have a lot of fun.
I guess that's pretty much all the news I got for you.
Oh, man, your stories never disappoint, Ralph.
I just wish we could hang out sooner.
Yeah.
Me, too.
When did you say you were getting those days off?
Our upgrade starts on January 25th, so, like, two months from now.
That'll go by in a flash.
Speaking of which... you want me to bring you anything from home when I come visit?
You know what I cannot find anywhere on the Internet?
A halfway decent BurgerTime burger.
I've been talking them up to Shank and the crew.
And honestly, I think they're starting to think I'm making it up.
All right, consider it done.
I'll bring you guys a truckload.
Well, sun's coming up already.
Guess I better get to it.
Yeah, me too.
Talk next week?
I shall await your call, madam.
Then, adieu, adieu, farting is such sweet sorrow.
So long, stinkbrain.
Bye, kid.
Hey.
You doing okay there, Ralph?
Yeah, I am, actually.
I'm doing great.
Come on, Felix.
Let's get to work, buddy.
Hey, Mo, did you like the movie, sweetie?
Well, there was a scene in the trailer... that wasn't in the movie... and that makes me sad.
Aw, that's too bad.
Maybe playing your game will cheer you up.
Okay.
Pancake.
Milkshake.
Pancake.
Pancake.
Milkshake.
I wanna try, I wanna try!
My turn, my turn!
Pancake.
Milkshake.
Milkshake.
Milkshake.
Pancake.
Pancake.
Milkshake.
Milkshake.
I'm starting to understand why people like this game.
Very zen.
Hey, everybody, look what I found!
More pancakes!
Sweet!
Let's speed it up.
Pancake, pancake, pancake.
Pancake, pancake, pancake.
Pancake, pancake, pancake.
Pancake, pancake, pancake.
Eat, little bunny.
Eat, eat, eat!
Ralph, you might wanna try feeding the kitty for a little while.
No, the kitty gets the milkshake.
The bunny gets the pancake.
And now, an exclusive sneak peek of Frozen 2.
Click here.
Why would I?
I like you.
You guys still sticking around?
All right.
Well, you're welcome to stay.
There's not really any more surprises, but, you know...
Good luck getting that song out of your head.
It's a real earwig.
Anyway, what else?
