"I might also mention that the shark here is animated by Matt O'Callaghan, who story-boarded this sequence as well, and that doesn't always happen.",neutral,0.7477

"If they would have given us more money, some of these scenes where Scuttle was walking on this rock, would've had more contact shadows, where you'd see his shadow cast on the rock, but that was a concession to the budget and the time restraints that we were under, that we didn't put those things in the film.",neutral,0.7346

"You'll never know what lonely is till you live by yourself on a rock Once we cast Buddy, we wrote it to sound like Buddy, and Buddy was saying, ""Don't write for me, write for the part."" His very first takes, he was playing Scuttle with an artificial seagull voice that we kind of thought, ""This is not the way to go.""

"The first time we screened this with an audience, and we see that she's an octopus for the first time, there was an audible reaction from the audience, just a little shudder.",neutral,0.619
"And that made it feel like, ""Yeah, that's working for her intro.""

"The snake charmer thing in here, I think, worked well with Alan's music.",positive,0.853
"On the witch, we actually took some live-action footage from a documentary, Disney Mysteries of the Deep, and Roy Disney was very versed and familiar with that, and worked on that and brought that to our attention.",neutral,0.6341

The crab was animated by Duncan Marjoribanks.,neutral,0.8883
"I'm always amused whenever I see it, ""'cause I think of 6'5"" Duncan Marjoribanks animating this teeny little thing.",positive,0.9256
"It's one of the great things about animation, that the animators don't have to look like the characters they portray.",positive,0.935
"Also, Andreas Deja animated Triton, who, I think, he's always said he based on his father somewhat.",neutral,0.9052
"Without the fins, yeah.",neutral,0.716
"A lot of these underwater scenes involve those little patterns of tight there, those are live-action patterns, the way you see light playing under a swimming pool almost, and those were double exposed over the painted backgrounds we drew to give a watery effect.",neutral,0.8242
"That's a technique we generally used, as well as filters over the film, to make this all seem like it was happening underwater.",neutral,0.7598
"Mark Dindal, the head of effects, who later became the director of The Emperor's New Groove and Chicken Little, he came up with this effect.",neutral,0.9078
"It's actually fairly simple and not that expensive to do, but it added a lot to the underwater scenes.",positive,0.8852

"We should mention, in terms of this song, that one of the very early screenings we had for an audience, we brought in a class of school kids into the studio, this sequence was pretty much all black-and-white, it didn't have the effects and everything there, and in the very first screening, the kids squirmed a lot.",neutral,0.6408
"That brought up the very controversial thing that there was some talk of either cutting this song or cutting it down, which, pretty much, Howard was horrified at the idea, we were horrified, Alan was horrified, Glen Keane, who was the lead animator on all this and responsible for a lot of it, was horrified.",negative,0.7827
"And even though there was a lot of discussion, it finally came to a point where we could leave it in the way it was for an additional screening now.",neutral,0.6051
"And in this second screening, there was more color.",positive,0.682
"For whatever reason, however, it worked out, they didn't squirm.",positive,0.6037
They were quiet through the whole number.,neutral,0.8087
Thank God.,positive,0.8553
You know they almost cut Over the Rainbow from The Wizard of Oz.,neutral,0.6372
And that was one of our arguments with this song.,neutral,0.5758
"Howard's contention was every musical needs a point at which its central character, the protagonist, sits down on a garbage pail, on a rock in the sea, and says, ""This is what I dream of."" And, of course, the rest of the story is all based on creating obstacles that this character has to overcome to achieve their dream.",neutral,0.5575
"It sets Ariel's character, it sets her up, what she wants, what she needs, and so much of the rooting interest of the mermaid comes out of this song.",neutral,0.863
"And certainly, I think, we're all very glad this wasn't tampered with, 'cause it's such a signature of the movie.",positive,0.8474
"Also, the earlier lyrics to this song, I might mention, Howard generally resisted changes that we would suggest, and rightfully so, 'cause many of my own personal ideas were stupid, but one that he did actually slightly agree on, his earlier lyrics of this song, he talked about leather in China and things like that.",neutral,0.508
"And we said to Howard, ""Well, her information is from this guy"" ""who doesn't have his story straight, the seagull."" So Howard went back and readjusted the lyrics, so he put in the thingamabobs and the whatchamacallits.",neutral,0.5243
Those weren't in the first version of the song.,neutral,0.8409
"'Cause he agreed that, yeah, that actually was in character for her, to have these offbeat terms for things.",neutral,0.658
"That painting right there, Glen Keane picked out that painting 'cause he wanted a picture, an image of a fire underwater to go with the lyric.",neutral,0.8686

We didn't have time to redo everything on this.,negative,0.5542

It really helped.,positive,0.9183
Thom Enriquez was the storyboard artist that story-boarded this sequence.,neutral,0.923
Beautiful draftsmanship.,positive,0.8533
"Our story team on the film overall was really an amazing story team, many of which have gone on to be directors, art directors, production designers...",positive,0.9841

"You can still see it, here and there, it's a tough color to make work.",neutral,0.6852
"Mark Henn animated these scenes of Ariel as she came up over the side, and I think he really did a great job of capturing her innocence and just her wide-eyedness at this whole new world that she's looking at, the Prince in particular.",positive,0.9411
"This is really the heart of the story here, obviously, her falling in love with the Prince.",neutral,0.5722
This is one of the pieces of music that I wrote first as a source piece for you to animate to.,neutral,0.8096
Right.,neutral,0.5665
I know you talked about Grieg.,neutral,0.8058
"Although, I don't really know Grieg.",neutral,0.6948
"Yeah, it's sort of a little bit of Hall of the Mountain King.",neutral,0.869
"And Grieg was Danish, so it all made sense somehow.",positive,0.6313
"One of the more difficult characters in this film was Prince Eric, and there's a tradition of Disney princes, that they hadn't worked very well.",negative,0.7166
"In Cinderella, I talked to Eric Larson, who animated on it, he said, ""Yeah, he was stiff, I didn't really get it right."" Animating the prince has been called the most thankless job in animation, because it's probably harder to do than any other character...",negative,0.7748
"Even in the Andersen fairytale, you don't get much of a sense of the Prince, as much as you do of the Little Mermaid, and that's a challenge.",negative,0.466
"The more realistic human characters are always the most difficult, but, still, a character like Ariel is still more fun.",positive,0.8233
"Particularly, Ariel was a great heroine.",positive,0.8739
"She at least had the extra aspect that she was part fish, and she could swim underwater and she can move in ways that humans couldn't possibly move, and that's why his screen time tends to be more limited too, because it's just difficult.",neutral,0.6222
"We had Matt O'Callaghan who animated the Prince, Mike Cedeno.",neutral,0.8788
"Christopher Barnes did the voice on the Prince, and I think he did a really nice job of trying to get an engaging, likeable guy.",positive,0.9711
"The storm sequence coming up was actually one of the first sequences done on the movie, along with the Under the Sea sequence and the Louis sequence, those were actually the first things that we actually started animation on.",neutral,0.5417
"Because it was almost like a musical sequence, in that it was so rich in production value, if we didn't do it early, we knew that we might not get it done, 'cause it would take longer and there'd be impulses to simplify it and cut it, and we'd be under the gun, so we knew it would be difficult, so the sooner we could get to it, the better.",neutral,0.5024
"We called them ""money shots."" Which, I guess, means that we're gonna spend extra money on them.",neutral,0.4797
"It was also because it was an action sequence, there were just so many aspects of it that could be done earlier on, whereas sequences that were primarily character-driven, we almost wanted to save until the animators had a little more time with the characters.",neutral,0.6404
"This sequence certainly is a tour de force of effects animation, the fact that it was done first really gave us a chance to go all out.",positive,0.8912
"And Mark Dindal, who was the head of effects on the movie, did a great job on this sequence.",positive,0.9727
The gray-green cast of the skies in all this was inspired by an N.C.,neutral,0.8568
"Wyeth painting he had done, I think it's from Kidnapped, or one of these, where there's a shipwrecked figure in the foreground and a ship in the background.",neutral,0.9033

"I never had a successful solution for this scene, I directed this sequence, and I wanted to be able to see the statue before it sank, so we cheated, so the statue was floating for a minute.",negative,0.6657

"""How do we show that before it goes away?"" So, it was bizarre, but there it is.",negative,0.4943
The water animation is beautifully done.,positive,0.9529

"It's funny, when you score a sequence like this, every hit becomes a source of stress for you.",negative,0.4752
"Leading up to the session, you want to make sure each hit is gonna work, so they're all imprinted indelibly on my brain.",neutral,0.805
I like that jazzy horn figure for the action when he's running across the ship.,positive,0.8732
I think that was cool.,positive,0.9786
I remember this was very early scoring for me.,neutral,0.7989
I should point out that the orchestrations were done by Thomas Pasatieri.,neutral,0.9005
He was a great help to me in learning the art of scoring.,positive,0.961
"Animation was not, at that point, hip.",neutral,0.6027

You think about how that must've turned on its ear within five years.,neutral,0.5431
And now we're into the reprise of Part of Your World.,neutral,0.8761
Here's a rare interview that Howard and I did at the time of the release of the film.,neutral,0.8082
"Alan writes great ballads, I think that's one of Alan's real gifts, is Alan can bring a tear to your eye pretty quick.",positive,0.9401
"And ballads are really, really hard in a musical for the whole family, because kids aren't famous for liking love songs.",negative,0.7489
"So it's hard to write a song that moves, and has a little bit of rhythm, and also tugs at your heartstrings and is a soft number.",neutral,0.5411
"And the challenge of this number was to do a ballad that also moved the plot forward, which is why the subject matter of being part of your world was so important.",neutral,0.5557
What is she realty longing for?,neutral,0.7156
What is going to not just stop the action but keep everything moving?,neutral,0.7922
This is John here.,neutral,0.8303
"Howard's lyrics on this, again, the original version was slightly different, in that Howard played the lyric of this as, kind of, that she was disappointed, and the original lyric on this was, ""I'll never be part of that world."" And she was sad as she dove into the water.",negative,0.6555
"I remember we talked with Howard about it and said, just because of the shape of the story, she's gonna be kind of moony about the Prince and feeling up about it.",neutral,0.8569
"We said we thought, actually, it would be better to play this as an up thing.",neutral,0.6773
"And Howard, again, that was the only other thing we ever talked Howard into, and he agreed and he revised the lyrics so that it was much more of a positive statement than a statement of regret or sadness.",positive,0.5852
Howard did mention to us early on there was an element of this that was like a handicapped girl wanting to walk.,neutral,0.867
"And I think that's what he drew on for the lyrics of the song, partly.",neutral,0.894
"Actually, the song itself should be titled Part of that World.",neutral,0.8224
And this is Part of Your World.,neutral,0.7825
-They've both taken on one title.,neutral,0.8312
"Yeah, that's true.",neutral,0.6265
"Glen Keane animated much of Ariel in this part, a great animator, and he did this scene where she's on the rock, and I remember we shot this with Sherri Stoner, but Glen acted out this scene for her.",positive,0.6462
"And Glen is a burly, football-player-looking kind of a guy, and there he was, he's doing this action of just tentatively coming up over the rock, and I still remember Glen's physical performance, it had all the sensitivity that you see here in his drawn version, but picture a muscular Gene Kelly kind of a guy doing this.",neutral,0.7448
"Here it is, a moment of determination.",neutral,0.5979
Every teenage girl's desire to be free of her parents.,neutral,0.7445
It's a major story moment.,neutral,0.5385
Everything up to that point is really set-up.,neutral,0.6951
"Now the situation is really clear that we've got a mermaid who is in conflict with her father, who wants something that is forbidden in her world and will do whatever it takes to get it.",negative,0.6672
Her daddy will love that.,positive,0.8089
"King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl...",positive,0.6318
I might mention Kathy Zielinski animated the witch in this sequence.,neutral,0.8899
"And there aren't a ton of women animators, but she's one of the best animators, period.",positive,0.9584
But she did a great job with the witch there.,positive,0.8276
"Those fish in that opening shot were computer fish, which we thought we might use more of in the movie, but at this point, the computer animation was not quite at a point where we were totally happy with it.",neutral,0.5365
"So we used the computer fish to a minimum, but they were in that one shot.",neutral,0.8221
And I do believe that this scene of Ariel was the first scene of Ariel animated in the entire movie.,positive,0.7194
Mark Henn animated this scene.,neutral,0.8838
"In the story reels, we had a longer version, and there were fish doing their hair and there were various things with the sisters that we took out.",neutral,0.9143
Howard and I were both huge fans of the earlier animated features.,positive,0.8719
"He felt that as the musical updated itself, the animated musical would also update itself.",neutral,0.661
"For us, Little Mermaid was the follow-up to Little Shop of Horrors.",neutral,0.7095
"As different as they are, it really was.",neutral,0.6823
"And there are people who joke and call Part of Your World, ""Somewhere That's Wet."" I haven't heard that.",negative,0.5659
-The other thing I want to say about...,neutral,0.8858
That's funny.,positive,0.8399
That's a joke on Somewhere That's Green.,neutral,0.527
"And so, we did a pastiche of '50s and '60s rock and roll, Little Mermaid, we did really our own pastiche of Disney.",positive,0.511
"When we started working on Sebastian, first you guys had Sebastian as a stuffy English...",neutral,0.8082
Clarence the crab.,neutral,0.7857
Clarence the crab.,neutral,0.7857
"Reggae was very hip and Howard said, ""Let's make him a Jamaican crab"" ""or a Caribbean crab.",neutral,0.6707
"Calypso."" I think of Harry Belafonte, that kind of warmth.",positive,0.5675
And so here are some thoughts from an earlier interview with myself and Howard Ashman.,neutral,0.9223
It's very hard to write contemporary sounding music in a fairytale context.,negative,0.5467
You're dealing with long ago and far away.,neutral,0.6462
"And you really still want to have a feeling that modern kids and adults can enjoy and start to move to, because that's how you get energy.",positive,0.704
And it was sort of a trick.,neutral,0.6732
"When I talked to John and Ron before the script was actually written, we had a long conference about that.",neutral,0.8914
Was there a way we could give the crab something in his personality that would make it possible to have a special kind of music that had some kind of rhythmic edge or contemporary feeling to it?,neutral,0.8556
And what we came up with was that there would be a Jamaican flavor to what he did in the music.,neutral,0.867
"And that was to get energy, to get a little bit of a pop feeling, and yet to have it be true to its fairytale roots.",neutral,0.6262
This song you guys finished in Burbank.,neutral,0.8938
"We started out actually at my farm in Pennsylvania, and Howard said he always wanted a figure that just circled back on itself.",neutral,0.8685
"That didn't end, so the song really started with the figure.",neutral,0.8333
"And one of the things I always talk about is in the world of animation, they're so specific in their references, and you guys especially, so as we made all these references, they animated the references.",neutral,0.7203
"And then when we went back to scoring, you guys wanted every one of these things that you had animated caught with different orchestral colors.",neutral,0.8238
"So you'll notice where there's all these different sea creatures, every single one is caught with a very specific scoring reference.",neutral,0.8313
"And I remember when we were working on this, Alan was right next to us, and Robby Merkin, who was doing the arrangements was right down the hall.",neutral,0.8301
So they would go back and forth with the storyboard artists and with us and be seeing hits that we were suggesting or a different fish they could use.,neutral,0.9211
"And they'd come back, ""Which one was this again, that was doing this part?"" It was the overdub session of all time.",neutral,0.7391
That's all I can say.,neutral,0.7555
"Overdub means after you've recorded the basic track, then you add other parts.",neutral,0.8769
"We did have to fight a bit with Jeffrey on this, in that we wanted to use colors as the song got progressively more joyous and that the color changed to these oranges and these reds.",neutral,0.5797
And Jeffrey had a hard time.,negative,0.6028
"He's like, ""Underwater is blue, guys."" And so we had to convince him it's okay.",neutral,0.5824
"So in some scenes, we had to sneak a little blue in the corners to keep Jeffrey happy, but eventually, he went along with it.",neutral,0.585
"We felt the mood of the song, no one's gonna worry that it's not blue anymore.",neutral,0.5638
It's hot.,positive,0.7562
Howard recorded the demo vocal on this one and he was just...,neutral,0.8555
A lot of the jokiness of Sam's reading.,neutral,0.7191
"Sam did a great job, but Howard, his original demo was full of spice.",positive,0.8569
Howard's vocals were definitely the blueprint for the final result.,positive,0.5452
"I think Sam's rendition of this song was one of the big things, in terms of getting cast for the role, because we heard a lot of actors sing that song and a lot of them were very good, and certainly Howard set the tone for it.",positive,0.9564
But I think Sam just did an incredible job with this song.,positive,0.9665
The interesting thing about Sam.,neutral,0.5287
Howard auditioned him in New York.,neutral,0.8935
"And we cast him never having met Sam, but we heard a tape of Sam.",neutral,0.8145
"And he was so great just on the tape that we said, ""That's the guy to do it."" And then we really met Sam the first time when he came in to record it.",positive,0.9653
We had never really met him before at all.,neutral,0.7161
The song that changed the Academy Awards.,neutral,0.6934
Alan won Oscars continuously...,neutral,0.5263
"I think there were eight, but who's counting?",neutral,0.8845
"Every Academy Award that Alan was involved in, he would win multiple Oscars.",positive,0.7713
-Usually score and song.,neutral,0.8072
Don't they come in pairs?,neutral,0.8471
"Then at a certain point, the Academy changed the awards so that musical scores would be a separate category.",neutral,0.7772
"We always looked at that, that that was the Alan Menken adjustment or whatever.",neutral,0.8789
"But Alan was winning so many awards, and everyone else felt left out, so they had to change the awards so that other people would have a chance.",neutral,0.5151
"Remember, I showed up for the Academy Awards, and they had me seated on the aisle, which I guess said something, because prior to that, I had been sitting in the middle of the aisle where I could never escape.",neutral,0.5814
"And I said to my friend, Dean Pitchford, who wrote Fame and Footloose, I said, ""I don't know, what do you think's going to happen?"" He says, ""I don't know who's gonna win the Oscar, ""but I looked backstage"" ""and the Academy Award had scales on it."" This sequence was very early in production, Ron directed this sequence.",neutral,0.7184
"This was the first stuff done on the crab, it seemed like...",neutral,0.8452
"Yeah, it was the first animation done on the crab.",neutral,0.766
Duncan Marjoribanks did the crab in this and Andreas Deja did Triton.,neutral,0.9162
And Ed Gombert story-boarded this and it's pretty much...,neutral,0.6433
The water is just fantastic to look at there.,positive,0.9763
"But this was a little sample of the movie in a way that went first and as I say, Ed Gombert story-boarded it, and it pretty much is exactly the way he story-boarded it.",neutral,0.6809
And it is just a nice little bit between the two of them that we were very happy with the way it turned out.,positive,0.9682
And it gave a nice sense of setting those two characters.,positive,0.8819
"But it's not a complicated scene from a directorial standpoint, except from the acting standpoint that it's realty getting a certain kind of dynamic in contrast.",neutral,0.7078
"It certainly is fun with the huge, imposing character, like the sea king and the little teeny character like the crab just kind of carrying on everyday conversation like they're not conscious at all of their size difference.",positive,0.8595
"We always thought Ariel's grotto was like a teenage girl's bedroom, and she's got her poster of a rock star who was the Prince.",neutral,0.7647
And that was the person that she was infatuated with.,neutral,0.6672
"And we were trying to draw the analogy with modern teenagers and their trouble with their fathers, obviously.",negative,0.5218
Overprotective parents and kids that don't want to have to be tied down by their parents.,negative,0.8752
"If you notice, the statue gets madder and madder as the sequence progresses.",neutral,0.6
-Is that right?,neutral,0.7914
His expression just keeps getting...,neutral,0.5998
Was that an accident or was that deliberate?,neutral,0.7033
"Not just the King, but the statue gets madder, too.",negative,0.5711
I never noticed that.,neutral,0.5201
"But, Dad, I...",neutral,0.7835
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?,neutral,0.7867
The father-daughter relationship in this movie I find to be one of the most emotional.,positive,0.884
Possibly because I've had two teenage daughters and seen them grow up.,neutral,0.7756
"Yeah, my daughter was born as we were making this, and now she's more this age, so I've seen it from both ends.",neutral,0.7727
We got a lot of letters in terms of this movie.,neutral,0.7253
And there's fan letters from people who liked the movie.,positive,0.5205
But I'd say we got more serious letters from fathers and daughters and things that they were emotionally involved in.,neutral,0.8092
"In some cases, at least with one father in particular, that this kind of brought about a reconciliation with his daughter who he was estranged by.",neutral,0.8085
And that was nice to get letters like that.,positive,0.9357
The only thing I find difficult is the idea that she's Triton's favorite daughter.,negative,0.6437
The idea of having a favorite daughter seems...,neutral,0.6754
It's contrary to someone who's got more than one daughter.,neutral,0.5843
"Our theory was that she's the most like him, and that that in effect was what created the conflict.",neutral,0.7339
"To the extent that we said when Triton was a younger man, he had red hair.",neutral,0.9218
That they clashed because they're both strong willed and individualistic.,neutral,0.6626
"The children's book illustrator, Chris Van Allsburg, did some drawings for us when we were trying to develop the look of the film, and he did one of Triton's palace with greens and golds, and he also did a study of the moonlit grotto that was one of the earliest visual representations of Ariel's grotto.",neutral,0.7073

"And they're animated by Shawn Keller, who's a quirky, nice guy, but got a lot of sinister mileage out of these guys.",neutral,0.5378
What's very effective about them is the idea that they trade off their lines in a totally seamless way.,positive,0.8811
But there is something.,neutral,0.7619
Howard was extremely specific about what he wanted.,neutral,0.8455
"It was always a big concession for Howard to have me play any role, 'cause he frankly would like to have played every role.",neutral,0.6569
"It carried over with the actors when Jodi was performing the number, Howard had so many specific things in his head and Jodi contributed a lot, but Howard had phrasing ideas and things that really were wrapped into his approach to it.",neutral,0.8501
"And Pat Carroll, really, he helped steer her through it.",neutral,0.6129
Certain songs more than others.,neutral,0.7914
"But the phrasing just was very, very specific.",neutral,0.7189
"I know a few people who could have written Ursula, but nobody at the level of the way Howard wrote her.",neutral,0.6279
Howard had said that one of the things he always wanted to do was run a children's theater.,neutral,0.7908
So you combine that with that West Broadway or West Village sensibility and you get a sense of who the man was.,neutral,0.8771
"Tremendously emotional person and also so hip and so cutting edge, as far as the zeitgeist of our culture.",positive,0.7318
"And certainly here, it's in Ursula, but I remember Howard said our assignment was to write a score for an animated musical that could sit on the shelf alongside Cinderella and Dumbo and Peter Pan and Pinocchio and, of course, Snow White.",neutral,0.5796
That's what he always said.,neutral,0.7301
Right.,neutral,0.5665
No!,neutral,0.4416

She's a monster.,negative,0.9564

You're good at that.,positive,0.663

Believable.,positive,0.6678
"""Teenagers, they think they know everything."" ""You give them an inch and they swim all over you."" This exterior, the witch's place, Mike Peraza, who is our art director, did that really cool layout of that sea creature and her actual shell, he designed that as well, and I always thought it was kind of Georgia O'Keeffe-esque.",positive,0.6279
"Those out-of-focus, dangling tendrils in the foreground, that was actually shot on a multi-plane camera.",neutral,0.8543
"The one done off the lot at Disney, 'cause the only one we could find that was up and working was actually done by a cameraman that Mark Dindal knew who shot stuff for Filmation.",neutral,0.8025
So that's one of two or three multi-plane shots in the movie.,neutral,0.9066
"A few of these first scenes of the witch were animated by Rob Minkoff, but then he left to do other things, and Ruben Aquino really did 98% of the witch and most of this song coming up, and this animation here is Ruben's animation.",neutral,0.8263
"And he did a beautiful job, in terms of just getting her personality, as well as just the technical issue of keeping all these tentacles alive and moving, and I loved what he did.",positive,0.9792
"Of course, Rob had also done an early exploratory drawing that Howard had really liked and we had really liked of the witch, where Howard said, ""This is great, she looks like a Miami Beach matron."" And we got into a whole thing about Divine.",positive,0.9052
"Divine is a cross-dressing guy, George was...",neutral,0.8474
What was his real name?,neutral,0.8647
"-His real name was Glen, but...",neutral,0.883
"Glen, okay, yeah.",neutral,0.6633
Everyone knows Divine as Divine.,neutral,0.6381
"People also know Divine, of course, as the original Edna Turnblad from the hit movie, Hairspray.",neutral,0.884
"He was from Baltimore, where Howard was from, I think.",neutral,0.9143
"And so, some of the early development art that Rob was doing and others were doing was really trying to get some of Divine's big, campy, overweight diva, get that into the witch.",neutral,0.8568
"And so there are still vestiges of it in the witch, although at one point, the witch even had a mohawk à la Pink Flamingos -and all that.",neutral,0.7797
Also Divine.,neutral,0.6776
"Also, Divine played that character, and Jeffrey thought that was a little too extreme.",negative,0.6065
"I don't think Jeffrey was aware that we were relating it to Divine, he just looked at us and he's like, ""Guys, it's 10% too much."" I think he was right on that, as I remember, it was pretty extreme.",negative,0.4846
Just want to point out the voice of Pat Carroll.,neutral,0.7547
We knew Pat Carroll from the Danny Thomas show.,neutral,0.8807
"And we really had a hard time casting the witch, because Howard had done so great with the demos.",neutral,0.4695
It was hard to find anybody that could match Howard.,neutral,0.5176
And then Pat Carroll came in and she really did a great job.,positive,0.9723
Nailed it.,neutral,0.4972
I know.,neutral,0.5132
"She always talked about how it was a cross between Tallulah Bankhead and Maurice Evans, Shakespearean thing in this vampy, throaty Southern belle or something.",neutral,0.8711
And that's what she got in the performance.,neutral,0.7863
"But on the whole I've been a saint To those poor unfortunate souls Now, here's the deal.",neutral,0.6428
I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days.,neutral,0.7726
"Actually, this song was done in two separate sessions.",neutral,0.9048
"We did it, and then we went back and did it again -just to get all the nuances.",neutral,0.795
Right.,neutral,0.5665
I think Jeffrey was pushing for that.,neutral,0.7913
She did a fantastic job.,positive,0.9653
Gary Trousdale story-boarded this sequence.,neutral,0.8971
And he really tried to visualize all this deal making.,neutral,0.7176
"And I thought he did a great job of really making it visual, so that we'd understand, even without the soundtrack, what's at stake here.",positive,0.8828
Some thoughts from Howard Ashman again.,neutral,0.9062
"We wanted to make songs that would tell the story, songs that would really move the story forward, really push the plot along and keep things driving ahead.",positive,0.6383

We perform when we write.,neutral,0.824
You have to.,neutral,0.7039
Howard is the actor.,neutral,0.6981
"Pat Carroll is wonderful, but you haven't heard the witch's number until you've heard Howard perform it.",positive,0.5974
And you never should.,neutral,0.5265
It's wonderful.,positive,0.9775
I generally get to play things like Ariel.,neutral,0.7434
Just 'cause you're shorter.,neutral,0.5859
Everybody would rather write for Captain Hook than for Peter Pan.,neutral,0.5889
They're just more fun.,positive,0.887
I don't know why.,negative,0.7105
"And Ursula's an especially fun villain, not only 'cause she looks like an octopus, you have that great movement with her lower regions.",positive,0.8829
But she's also very sophisticated as a character.,neutral,0.5239
She's much more verbal.,neutral,0.5475
"Then as a lyricist, that was fun for me, because I got to make more rhymes and more puns and more sophisticated humor with her.",positive,0.9426
"I see her song as a comedy number, first of all, and a character number.",neutral,0.7696
"And then, third, talk about things that are driving the plot forward.",neutral,0.8753
"At the beginning of that song, Ariel doesn't even know who Ursula is practically.",neutral,0.6054
"And by the end of that song, she's a human.",neutral,0.6218
"So, a whole lot changes in that little three-minute sequence.",neutral,0.8012
"I think we are thinking of something almost Kurt Weill-ish from The Threepenny Opera, for the basic feel of that number.",neutral,0.8635
And it's very seductive and Ursula's very seductive.,neutral,0.6501
And she's seducing Ariel into making this deal.,neutral,0.5643
"I remember when we did this, Howard talked about the shape of this number, and I'd never really heard that term used, as far as music went.",neutral,0.7752
"But he was talking about how, in terms of this last thing with the spell, that it almost was like a three-act play in itself or something.",neutral,0.8667
"Well, it's a big musical scene.",neutral,0.5791
You have the basic body of the song.,neutral,0.8353
You break for the dialogue when she's outlining the terms of the contract.,neutral,0.5527
"Then she comes back in full on the end of the song, -and then we transfer into the spell.",neutral,0.882
The spell section.,neutral,0.7293
"One thing we haven't talked about, which is so great about you and Howard and the songs that you did, is the storytelling aspect.",positive,0.92
"There are a lot of bad musicals, where sometimes you cut the songs out and sometimes it seems better.",negative,0.5812
And the songs are so much a part of just telling this story.,neutral,0.6281
They're integral to the story and they advance things.,neutral,0.5581
We have to be good thieves.,neutral,0.6023
"We always have to take from your script, and sometimes take the best aspects and incorporate it into our songs, and cover as much of the plot as we possibly can.",positive,0.689
"This shot, I might mention, we always thought of it as our Sports Illustrated shot.",neutral,0.8357
"But it was this backlit thing and a girl in the water, like a shampoo commercial or something.",neutral,0.85
There was something picturesque we wanted to do about it.,neutral,0.5717
"In the Andersen story, when the mermaid walks, she left bloody footprints and all.",neutral,0.6987
"We didn't really want to do that, but we did want to make this transition where she got her legs feel a little bit painful, in an homage almost to the Andersen thing.",neutral,0.5102
"That exterior of the palace, Rowland Wilson designed...",neutral,0.8988
He is a great draftsman.,positive,0.9337
He designed the Prince's palace.,neutral,0.8411
He did a drawing that we loved that combined these Mediterranean elements.,positive,0.9391
It made it a palace unlike any other Disney fairytale palace.,positive,0.6698
"And with the whitewashed stucco, it was really going for a warm Southern Mediterranean feel that he thought would be attractive to a mermaid who had been stuck all her life in the cold ocean.",neutral,0.5922
"We had a challenge here to stage this, because technically, in between those legs and that upper body, she's really not wearing any clothes.",neutral,0.7439
"So, we had to get her dressed and yet keep it discreet.",neutral,0.8314
"So, it was staged in a way where she was underwater in this sequence.",neutral,0.7765
That helped us.,positive,0.7767
There's such a feeling to this movie in scenes like this that is just infused with this fantastic innocence.,positive,0.9541
And it always makes you feel just wonderful.,positive,0.9693
I got it.,positive,0.4689
"It's your hairdo, right?",neutral,0.8196
"You've been usin' the dinglehopper, right?",neutral,0.8359
No?,neutral,0.6175

New seashells?,neutral,0.8763
"This scene right here, where the crab goes through this slight nervous breakdown, and then comes through and decides he's actually going to help Ariel, actually Howard wrote that.",neutral,0.8093
-That was added.,neutral,0.7733
Wrote the dialogue for that.,neutral,0.7772
"We had the basis of the scene, but we were struggling.",neutral,0.5659
"And actually, Michael Eisner had felt that the crab needed a real turning point here.",neutral,0.8184
And we were really knee-deep in stuff and a little bit burned out.,negative,0.755
"Howard wrote this scene, and it's a beautiful scene.",positive,0.9737
-Is that right?,neutral,0.7914
"Yeah, he did.",neutral,0.6895
"In terms of where the crab comes around and says, ""You're going to be miserable for the rest of your life."" This is Howard's dialogue here.",negative,0.7206
"Because Michael Eisner felt like his change from being against Ariel to being her ally in this happened offstage in our earlier version that we showed him, and he said, ""Unless you show that onstage, people aren't going to understand."" I think it was a good point.",positive,0.686
He was right.,positive,0.5885
And Howard did a great job of comically putting this over.,positive,0.8386
"When he goes from, ""I'm not going to help you.",negative,0.5633
"This is the worst thing ever."" To, ""Okay, I'll help you."" And he did a great job.",negative,0.3836
"Howard, of course, as a book writer on our musicals, he was an executive producer on this and on Beauty and the Beast.",neutral,0.6612
"Actually, he moved out here and was living out here.",neutral,0.8991
"But what a resource to have that kind of person offstage, so to speak.",neutral,0.5793
"It says, ""Additional dialogue by Howard Ashman,"" if you watch the end credits.",neutral,0.8933
There were two or three scenes where he did rewrite some of the dialogue.,neutral,0.901
"And this was the key one, really.",neutral,0.6712
"We weren't sure when he came in, in terms of how that might work, and he didn't write for a while aside from the songs.",neutral,0.6116
He held back.,neutral,0.7215
Not that we would have had a problem with it.,neutral,0.739
"For whatever reason, he held back for a while.",neutral,0.5903
And he was involved with our writing and would make suggestions and would make things.,neutral,0.8547
But he didn't write himself until this point.,neutral,0.7125
"And then Howard stepped in and wrote this, wrote two or three other bits that are all really memorable, great little moments in the movie.",positive,0.9316
I never knew that.,neutral,0.4687
I'd love to know where they are.,positive,0.6384
We'll tell you as we're going through.,neutral,0.8557
"We were really going for a watercolor look with these backgrounds, where you see the highlights really almost showing through the paper, that was really a throwback to a Pinocchio painting style and that kind of a thing, in terms of the way this looks.",neutral,0.7125
Glen Keane animated Ariel in this section.,neutral,0.905
We did use live-action reference for both Ariel and Eric to help the animators to get a jumping off point.,neutral,0.7539
"Sherri Stoner was an actress, a great improv comedian, and just brought a lot of spark to it and helped to inspire Glen Keane.",positive,0.9289
The combination really worked into some very nice acting.,positive,0.9709
You seem very familiar to me.,positive,0.8512
Have we met?,neutral,0.8211
We have met.,neutral,0.7064
I knew it.,neutral,0.5054
"You're the one, the one I've been looking for.",positive,0.8449
"Glen animated this scene here, where she's trying to do her pantomime thing 'cause she can't speak.",neutral,0.6601
And how can she put over what she did?,negative,0.661
And it's just a tour de force.,neutral,0.6563
Animation is great when you have to rely on pantomime to really put over the ideas.,positive,0.8028
"Certainly, early on in this movie, there was a lot of controversy over the idea that our leading character would not speak for a big portion of the movie.",negative,0.5341
"And certainly in story reels, it was a problem, because she seemed to disappear a lot in the scenes where she didn't speak.",negative,0.6466
"But we were kind of saying when she's animated, when the acting is there, it will be different.",neutral,0.8429
"And Glen Keane and Mark Henn, who did a lot of this material where she doesn't speak.",neutral,0.8603
I think that was the case.,neutral,0.8348
"Once the animation got in, she was alive and she kept alive.",positive,0.6276
"And it's a tribute to the art of animation, but that's animation acting at its best.",positive,0.7243
"Pantomime can be a tough sell, as we found out with the carpet in Aladdin, similar idea that...",neutral,0.4895
"You have to say ""Trust us"" a lot.",neutral,0.748
"""Trust us.",neutral,0.67
"It will work."" One of the things that I guess also helps keep her alive without her voice is that music plays a role.",positive,0.7537
"-Yeah, absolutely.",neutral,0.6542
It was key.,neutral,0.6411
The underscore becomes basically her voice.,neutral,0.8191
It does become her voice.,neutral,0.8246
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"This sequence in the earlier version of the film, as we were working on it, had been longer, and it was felt that this needed to be paced up a little bit.",neutral,0.7828
"So, this whole section was trimmed down a little bit.",neutral,0.8597
These washerwomen had a longer rant that they talked about.,neutral,0.7644
All this got compressed and turned into one little set piece of mistreatment of the crab.,negative,0.9028
"There's also a bit with Max the dog chasing the crab around the castle, that got cut.",neutral,0.8132
We had trouble with that shot.,negative,0.676
"Making it read, I think.",neutral,0.7982
We did it four or five times.,neutral,0.8485
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
Just wasn't clear that those were stuffed crabs or something.,negative,0.5055
Just something about it wasn't so clear.,negative,0.5518

"I don't know how we let all that through, but we did.",neutral,0.6023
This is one of my favorite scenes where she walks into the tight.,positive,0.9825
Mark Henn animated it.,neutral,0.8646
"Just the staging of it and the layout, Dave Dunnet is our head of layout, I don't know if that was Dave's layout, but it's one of my favorite scenes.",positive,0.9768
We always called this the Cinderella scene.,neutral,0.8151
She's coming out in her magic dress and everything.,neutral,0.6936
"Let me help you, my dear.",neutral,0.5834
There we go.,neutral,0.5761
That's better.,positive,0.77
"See, now, she had a napkin in that last scene and no napkin now.",neutral,0.6768
"No plate, either.",neutral,0.637
"Grimsby is Ben Wright, who is a great character actor.",positive,0.9457

"We loved what he did in the reading, we cast him based on that, not realizing that he was actually the voice of Roger in 101 Dalmatians, and that he also did a voice in Jungle Book.",positive,0.9205
But we didn't know that when we cast him.,neutral,0.6688
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"Carlotta's voice is Edie McClurg, who's a great comic actress who's done a lot of work in film and television, and was on Pee-wee's Playhouse and various things, but a wonderful comedian.",positive,0.9645
I know we tested a fair amount of actors for Louis.,neutral,0.83
"And there again, whenever Howard's done the demo, you feel like you got to find somebody that is at least where Howard is at and hopefully can bring something more to it.",positive,0.6583
And that's not easy.,negative,0.6916
"I knew René Auberjonois more as a dramatic actor, and I didn't know him so much doing comedy, but when he came in and read for the part and did this song, he really brought a lot of comedy to it.",positive,0.815
"Of course, in different countries, they dub Louis differently.",neutral,0.6985
"So, in France, I think he becomes an Italian chef.",neutral,0.8973
-Is that right?,neutral,0.7914
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
That's right.,neutral,0.569
It's always somebody else.,neutral,0.4826
"You look at Chef Louis and you go, ""Would we get away with a song in an animated now"" ""in which basically one of our characters"" ""is literally describing how you're going to kill?"" -Right.",neutral,0.4909
They're tight.,neutral,0.6566
"And all the imagery, knives and axes and all that.",negative,0.5793
We loved it.,positive,0.9209
And we did it as was constructed.,neutral,0.7753
"But now, I think they would give us a hard time.",negative,0.706
"Well, because people overthink things.",negative,0.8109
Les Poissons is a very slight song.,neutral,0.6639
It's very French musical.,neutral,0.5568
It's very deliberately in that style.,neutral,0.821
And it's mostly a comedy song.,neutral,0.7121
"And this song as a song is a fairly compact, short song, which really completes itself with the chase sequence at the end.",positive,0.8382
"Originally, this was a longer thing, too.",neutral,0.8504
"Howard had a whole, ""Class, do this and class, do this."" It was just a little too long, so we had to tighten it up a bit.",negative,0.4869
Gary Trousdale story-boarded it.,neutral,0.8527
"Don Martin, Mad Magazine sort of drawing.",neutral,0.8557
"Like many other sequences, I remember it was a lot of trial and error for the chase, for the music we used and the length of it.",neutral,0.7143
"And it also had the demo love aspect in that I really did not want to use the cancan, Offenbach...",negative,0.8421
I really wanted to use...,positive,0.5839
And for whatever reason...,negative,0.5442
Did we give you a hard time about that?,neutral,0.6091
I don't remember.,neutral,0.635
"I just finally said, you know what, somehow the cancan, it really worked better for all of us.",positive,0.9221
"And I just went, ""Okay."" And I think I may have played with it, and in the end we said, ""You know what,"" ""we're trying to reinvent the wheel.",neutral,0.7054
"Let's just go with the wheel."" And the association of the original cancan, which everyone knew, was so strong.",neutral,0.5018
It was a question in a Disney film how far you can go.,neutral,0.7873
And I think Howard found which was right.,neutral,0.5402
"Had he gone a little further than this, it might've been too far, but I think it really works well.",positive,0.7781
-Cruelty can be very funny.,positive,0.4532
Yes.,positive,0.461
"And his sense of humor, of course, was...",neutral,0.6672

Howard was so smart and had such a tough sensibility.,positive,0.924
-He was caustic.,negative,0.6252
"Caustic, I think, is the word.",neutral,0.6035
Alan did something on this movie that we haven't done in any other movie.,neutral,0.5163
"And he actually wrote, in effect, the silent film score, where he on a solo piano recorded a bunch of themes that we then put against the action.",neutral,0.8895
"Again, many of which Alan recorded without having seen the action.",neutral,0.7214
There were ideas of sketches of tones and things like that.,neutral,0.8871

"Occasionally, it seems to me, he did it live.",neutral,0.871
"That is, you're just watching the picture and doing music, reacting to the picture and...",neutral,0.7959
"There were times where we got so used to Alan's solo piano underscore that even when we heard the whole orchestra, there were a few spots where I missed the solo piano, and I actually said to the orchestra a little bit, I wasn't sure, ""What if we just left those in as solo piano?"" I was thinking specifically of the scene where Ariel is brushing her hair, and she's out on the balcony at night and there was a beautiful theme.",neutral,0.5408
"It still is, the music that's there, but it was just the solo piano that had a wistfulness or something, so we got used to those things.",neutral,0.7893
"-Well, it's called demo love.",neutral,0.6136
"Yeah, right.",neutral,0.5468
"Yes, we've had a lot of that, unfortunately.",negative,0.6933
"It's very tough when you get very used to things that are temporary, but they're there for maybe three years before they get replaced.",negative,0.6069
And this was another scene that Howard rewrote our dialogue on.,neutral,0.8288

Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"""Just pucker up your lips."" These are Howard's dialogue.",neutral,0.6131

"John directed that sequence, but the little bedroom scene is one of my favorite scenes in the movie.",positive,0.9758
"You are hopeless, child.",negative,0.9668
You know that?,neutral,0.7199
Disney had gotten away from those kinds of lyrical scores that go along with the visuals and accent the visuals.,neutral,0.6888
"You really brought that back, I think, which was good and we wanted that.",positive,0.9537
"I think people think just because something is retro, going back to the '30s and '40s, that the reference will mean nothing because our audience are kids.",negative,0.6825

And I loved that Penny Lane horn in there.,positive,0.9601
-That was neat.,positive,0.9467
"That was very cool, I thought.",positive,0.9856
"Brenda Chapman story-boarded this sequence, and we struggled with this goofy puppet show, trying to make it read and yet be quick and funny.",neutral,0.5082
-Probably a little too quick.,negative,0.5897
"Yeah, too quick, probably.",neutral,0.5505
Here are some thoughts from an earlier interview with myself and Howard Ashman.,neutral,0.9402
"When I had been offered the opportunity to write the underscore for the entire picture, I was looking for, ""How do you do this?"" And there's nobody around who does this anymore, really, this kind of underscore.",neutral,0.488
"In a sense, you're choreographing like you would a ballet.",neutral,0.8052
You're choreographing the movie.,neutral,0.7119
"Therefore, you're pulling from traditions that haven't been putted from in years, in terms of underscore.",neutral,0.6568
"In the old days, a lot of the music was written first before they animated a thing.",neutral,0.7864
Just even the background music was written first.,neutral,0.8389
"And in some ways, we've gone back to some parts of that old tradition in deciding the songs as the story itself is getting developed.",neutral,0.9073
So there are lots of places where they have animated right to the music.,neutral,0.7666
If there's a little...,neutral,0.8089
They've animated to that.,neutral,0.7798
That...,neutral,0.7123
was in the little demo recording that we made.,neutral,0.8512
And it's been there for three years.,neutral,0.5554
And finally it becomes a little dance step.,neutral,0.7492
It's amazing to see.,positive,0.9672
Now we come up to Kiss the Girl.,neutral,0.8379
"If there was gonna be a single, it was gonna be Kiss the Girl.",neutral,0.8447
But that never really developed.,negative,0.5876
"When we wrote our original treatment, we had a little sequence, and Howard said, ""I think there could be a serenade."" And so that evolved into this, Kiss the Girl.",neutral,0.8049
"And the stakes in that song, they really help give a dramatic tension to this.",neutral,0.5561
And it has a plot point.,neutral,0.7767
"We could never get Howard to just say, ""I'm going to write a song for the pop market,"" until Beauty and the Beast.",neutral,0.6041
We basically took the rock riff...,neutral,0.892
"Which is the standard riff you'd think of, in terms of Phil Spector or Billy Joel, and just turned it on its ear in a little bit of a Caribbean way with a...",neutral,0.7706
"And just built up through all the animals into the various sounds, into a full arrangement.",neutral,0.8202
Those reeds that are coming up are reused from The Old Mill.,neutral,0.9256
The old 1937 Silly Symphony.,neutral,0.7741
We try not to steal things from other movies too often.,neutral,0.7333
Unless they're great.,neutral,0.6375
We all steal what we have to.,negative,0.497
"I actually did a little corrected animation on that one scene of Ariel, just sort of looking over.",neutral,0.732
"Somebody adjusted the timing, so one of the few scenes I quasi had something to do with animating in the movie.",neutral,0.7559
"It's strange, but I did.",neutral,0.631
Howard Ashman again.,neutral,0.8017
"Kiss the Girl has a little bit of a Caribbean or maybe even a little Latin feeling to it, and I'm a doo-wop person, so it's got just a little bit of...",neutral,0.7685
Thrown in there for spice and for fun.,neutral,0.6449
Sing with me now.,neutral,0.7925
"It's a good time to talk about the voice of Jodi Benson, which we hear as the voice of Ariel and then it becomes the entire emotional impetus for Eric.",positive,0.7903
Jodi is somebody who had worked with Howard in Smile.,neutral,0.9116
And I had known Jodi for years in New York.,neutral,0.8863
"Very talented actress, singer, dancer, the whole deal.",positive,0.9223
"We had auditions here in L.A., we had auditions in New York that Howard supervised.",neutral,0.8668
"And we heard her audition, not having been there, present at the audition, but she did such a great job.",positive,0.9576
"In most of the auditions, people would come in and sing Over the Rainbow or something like that.",neutral,0.8888
"And then on call backs, I think they did Part of Your World.",neutral,0.8906
"But I think Jodi was very comfortable with doing those slips between speaking some lines, singing some lines.",positive,0.5149
"There's a very real quality in Jodi's voice and she has the classic Menken voice, which I really like, someone who can give you a good Broadway belt but then mix into a soprano.",positive,0.9301
One of the things we did totally differently than any other picture was we went directly from our demos and we had all of the vocal performances done to synthesizers.,neutral,0.7254
And then we wiped away the synth tracks and recorded orchestral parts -to replace them.,neutral,0.6543
Which was the wrong way to do it.,negative,0.801
"Occasionally, we got into some trouble on that.",negative,0.5664
"'Cause the mistake that we made was, we animated to those tracks.",negative,0.6504
"Unfortunately then, those tracks all had to be replaced at the end, and they had to hit all these musical accents.",negative,0.7523
"So it made a nightmare for the musicians at the end of the line, trying to hit these on-stage musical hits that we had animated to.",negative,0.5935
It was a slight nightmare when we were recording.,neutral,0.5978
But they were great synth tracks.,positive,0.8868
And it gave the studio the comfort to move forward with the project without having to spend a fortune up front.,positive,0.628
"Disney animation is always done in the warm-cool thing here, where you play off warm things against cool.",positive,0.5424
So the little fireflies against the blue background.,neutral,0.7444
I just like that play of color.,positive,0.9086
And it's our homage to Pirates of the Caribbean or something.,neutral,0.6355
-Really?,neutral,0.6854
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"We had originally written a longer scene between the Prince and Ariel, hadn't we, at the end of that, that we wound up doing away with...",neutral,0.7847
There was a whole scene that was gone.,neutral,0.6708
"Where the Prince talked about his conflict, of he likes her, but there's this other girl that he's heard her voice, and rubbing it in a little bit, it was a Hans Christian Andersen-y scene.",neutral,0.6953
"But we certainly had to cut things down a lot, in terms of the story, it got simpler as it went along and essentially, that didn't seem like it was necessary, that you got the Prince's conflict without him having to articulate it.",neutral,0.6881
So we took that whole scene out before we ever animated it.,neutral,0.6158
This idea coming up wasn't in the Andersen fairytale.,neutral,0.537
"The Prince was getting married to another girl, but it wasn't the witch.",neutral,0.7805
"The witch was more prominent in our thing, in the idea of the witch actually using her voice and transforming into something to thwart Ariel from winning the Prince's heart.",neutral,0.8441
That was an idea that we added to the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale.,neutral,0.7605
Also one of the things that surprised me in our early screenings was that scene when the Prince looks in the window and you see Ariel combing her hair with a fork.,positive,0.7341
"It got a strong reaction, and it's something that you'd almost take for granted as you're working on the movie, and the fact that people really responded seemed to indicate like they were getting something here, they were really into that.",positive,0.8321
Howard again.,neutral,0.5652
It's just amazing the way the animators enrich and bring to life and cause something inanimate to act.,positive,0.9558
It's like having the greatest actors in the world performing your material.,positive,0.8112
And it's just what we had in mind.,neutral,0.7839
"And it is what we conceived, in terms of tone and in terms of content.",neutral,0.862
"There's just something about the Disney fairytale cartoons, going all the way back to Snow White and then to Pinocchio.",positive,0.857
I grew up on Pinocchio and Peter Pan.,neutral,0.6761
"And the idea of doing one of those, it's like there's all these library books on the shelf.",neutral,0.5829
"There's Snow White and there's Sleeping Beauty and there's Cinderella, there's Peter Pan, there's Pinocchio, and to try to make something that fits comfortably on the shelf with those, what a difficult thing to do, but what a great thing to try to do.",positive,0.657
"It's a humbling experience, I'll tell you.",positive,0.8966
But to try to do something that could actually be comfortable in that line of titles is pretty amazing.,positive,0.9091
I think it does give you latitude to work in all kinds of musical styles and just to dream.,positive,0.6293
"And this is one of early CGI, computer-animated steps, was still the infancy of computer animation, but we used it.",neutral,0.6497
"It generated a 2D drawing that then was painted, but the actual stairs were built in the computer and then painted by hand based on the drawings generated from that.",neutral,0.8953
"Congratulations, my dear.",positive,0.9689
"Patty Disney, the wife of Roy Disney, I remember her talking after the preview.",neutral,0.7848
Where this scene coming up is one of Patty Disney's favorite scenes.,positive,0.8818
"Where she's hearing the news, and she does this little thing with her hands, and she's just kind of disturbed, and she always singled this out -as one of her favorite scenes.",neutral,0.5299
That's Mark Henn.,neutral,0.8534
"And Renee Holt, I think, did the cleanup on this.",neutral,0.8859
"The cleanup on the movie Vera Lanpher supervised, and the cleanup staff did a great job.",positive,0.969
"Yeah, and the cleanup animation is...",neutral,0.6549
The animators actually work rough and there are other artists that clean up their work.,neutral,0.6797
They take the scribbler drawings and make them tighter and more precise for painting later.,neutral,0.7743
"In this case, we used black Xerox for the characters, but we wanted a delicacy to it, so people actually used a mechanical pencil to give a very fine line, which almost gave an ink look, in the sense that the lines were thin enough, they would pick up some of the color around it.",neutral,0.7544
And it gave a delicacy to it.,neutral,0.6367
It was hard to do.,negative,0.6082
But they did a great job on the cleanup.,positive,0.9014
"Roy Disney's involvement in the film, certainly Roy had a nautical background, he was a yachtsman, he loved the sea, so there were various points in terms of terminology, he changed some of our dialogue to reflect the truer nauticalisms.",positive,0.5673
"I think he changed something we had to ""a following sea."" I still don't know what a following sea is, but we used that line based on Roy's suggestion.",neutral,0.7615
"I think Jodi enjoyed also playing this sort of villainous character when Ursula has gained Jodi's voice, so to speak.",positive,0.5346
She was sick of being sweet.,negative,0.664
Gave her a little angle to play with.,neutral,0.8148
The sea witch!,neutral,0.5839
"Oh, no!",negative,0.6841
She's gonna...,neutral,0.869
I gotta...,neutral,0.7244
"We first started to record the actors in 1987, and some of the recording continued till 1989.",neutral,0.9076
"So it was about a two-year period from beginning to end, in terms of recording sessions.",neutral,0.9224
We actually recorded the entire movie.,neutral,0.8108
"Everybody was out for a week where we recorded all the dialogue in the script, all the songs in terms of that week, and we started since we had all the actors, we did a reading of the entire script with the songs, everybody singing the songs and the actors doing their dialogue.",neutral,0.8541
"And it was pretty exciting, except that when it was over, it turned out that nobody had pressed record.",positive,0.8805
We hadn't recorded the entire reading.,neutral,0.6934
And we actually then went back and did it again.,neutral,0.8026
We did the second take of the entire film.,neutral,0.8903
I guess I blocked all of this out.,neutral,0.5173
"You were there, Alan, but it's okay not to remember it.",neutral,0.6321
"It was a horrifying thing for us, we felt responsible and we were.",negative,0.7183
"I think we were probably the ones who should have told someone to press record, but...",neutral,0.6764
"It's like nobody said action, so they didn't roll the film and they blew up the fort.",negative,0.7869
"But at the same time, after it's going for an hour, it seemed like maybe someone might have wondered whether or not it was supposed to be recorded, but it didn't happen.",neutral,0.5754
'Cause we had had table readings before that that affected the writing of the script and the casting of the characters a little bit.,neutral,0.6868
"But at that point, I think we got a sense of the actors playing off of each other more so than anything.",neutral,0.8296
We were happy 'cause we usually hear the actors in isolation and don't hear them as much together in the same room.,positive,0.785
"And we got a good sense of Ken Mars really feeling like he could be her father, and the difference in voice quality between the crab and Ken and all that.",neutral,0.6085
"I think it came to life in the room, but I don't think that we really rewrote much based on that reading.",neutral,0.7698
"No, I don't think we did a lot of rewriting.",neutral,0.713
"I know we were a little concerned at the time, because we may have been a little over-rehearsed at this point, which is the difference between Broadway and movies.",negative,0.4854
"In animation, normally, we don't rehearse a lot.",neutral,0.7354
"The actor comes in kind of familiar, but there's a freshness to that.",neutral,0.5358
"As they're just doing the dialogue spontaneously, that we realized that the actors had learned this like a stage play.",neutral,0.6985
"But there's a certain slight sense of losing spontaneity that way, so that they almost had to work in the recording to try to get the spontaneity back.",neutral,0.5088
"Usually, the way we did the recording of the actors, Ron would be out in the recording studio with the actor helping prompt them and give them specific on-site direction.",neutral,0.9224
I would be in the recording booth trying to hear it more the way an animator would hear it.,neutral,0.7704
"I didn't almost look at the actor, and I would just listen to the tracks and try and just listen to the vocal performance.",neutral,0.7924
"And Ron was doing that with Buddy, and Buddy didn't like having somebody breathing down his neck.",negative,0.5503
"So, he did mention to Ron, ""I'd like to do this again.",neutral,0.5003
"Alone."" And I slumped out.",neutral,0.579
"We did a little sound trick on her voice there when it's this disembodied voice, we made it sound a little bit more ethereal, and then as it comes back into her throat, then we dissolved off that effect to give it more of Jodi's natural voice.",neutral,0.8257
"In our first script, our first treatment even, it's very easy to write that she has the most beautiful singing voice anyone has ever heard.",positive,0.978
And now comes the point...,neutral,0.6581
"Now, you've gotta find somebody who can live up to that.",neutral,0.7137
But I think Jodi was the girl.,neutral,0.8074
"One thing I do remember is throughout the whole process, dreading the post-production in which we were going to have to thread that voice through, and orchestrate around it and somehow make it work.",neutral,0.5375
It's very complicated.,negative,0.5139
I know that the earlier scene where Ariel loses her voice and it goes into the shell works beautifully.,positive,0.7886
"And it seemed like it might be problematic, but you really have the sense that she's singing, and yet suddenly, the voice is now in the shell and it's not in her anymore.",neutral,0.4927
"And through the mixing and through the performance, everything, -that just really sold the idea.",neutral,0.5324
Disney has great sound people.,positive,0.9583
Great mixers.,positive,0.8787
Mel Metcalfe was the music mixer on this.,neutral,0.9183
Terry Porter was the head mixer and Mel did the music mix.,neutral,0.9002
Terry Porter did all the dialogue mixing and made all the different recordings -to match perfectly with the rich vocals.,neutral,0.5852
Fantastic guys.,positive,0.8513
"...binding and completely unbreakable, even for you.",positive,0.5895
"I remember we had big meetings, long meetings, all about hair, just about hair and how to handle hair.",neutral,0.797
"Underwater, things need to move.",neutral,0.7884
"So, it made it a more complicated movie, in that we wanted the hair generally not to be at rest, just to keep alive the feeling that you are underwater.",neutral,0.7068
"It added a lot of complexity, because the hair had to move at all times in the underwater sequences.",neutral,0.492
"Whereas in normal animation, characters go into holes, they rest.",neutral,0.6746
"That gives the animator a rest, too.",neutral,0.7423
"But in this case, there was a lot of extra work that the audience isn't really conscious of.",negative,0.5066
But it adds a lot to the underwater scenes.,positive,0.7235
"We had a great story crew on this film, all the storyboard artists, Ed Gombert, who also did the Under the Sea sequence, and Roger Alters, who was a director on The Lion King, Gary Trousdale, who was a director on Beauty and the Beast.",positive,0.9716
We just had a fantastic storyboard crew.,positive,0.9756
"Chuck Campbell, who did the sound effects on Roger Rabbit, his team, Lou Edemann and Rick Franklin particularly did a lot of the specific cutting for the film.",neutral,0.8865
"They were the team that really helped create the sound for the movie, trying to get a unique underwater sound and a fuller effects track than had ever been done on an animated film to that point that we had been involved with, certainly.",positive,0.6675
And they had to really try a lot of things to get variety in the underwater ambience.,neutral,0.8072
And there was a lot of work done with that.,neutral,0.7801
"One thing I felt was good on Mermaid that we didn't have to deal with was we didn't have to really deal with comparisons, in the sense that nothing like this had been done before at all, really.",positive,0.6064
And certainly nothing had been done like this for years.,negative,0.6054
"So, it was like, ""This is a real musical!"" ""This is fresh.",positive,0.7254
"These songs are so great and they tell the story."" But then, say, like when Beauty and the Beast is done, you're now comparing music you're hearing for the first time with Mermaid, which is music that's become a part of you.",positive,0.9131
"So, I've always noticed on the reviews that when the next film comes out, there were early reviews of Beauty and the Beast that would say, ""Well, this score is good, but it's not Mermaid."" And then Aladdin would come out and it would say, ""This score is good,"" ""but it's not Beauty and the Beast."" How can you compare something that you're just hearing for the first time?",neutral,0.4652
"We had a different version of this earlier where the witch didn't grow huge, and Ariel stepped in the way of her bolt at the Prince and there was a whole different scenario here.",neutral,0.731
"And our boss, Jeffrey Katzenberg, felt like it wasn't a big enough climax.",negative,0.7014
"And at the time, the movie Die Hard had come out.",neutral,0.8934
"And he's like, ""Guys, I want more Die Hard."" ""How do we get Die Hard into The Little Mermaid?"" So, we wound up with this giant witch, which wasn't in the earlier draft, and tried to make her more of a formidable obstacle, 'cause she didn't seem formidable enough in the earlier version.",neutral,0.5125
"Also, I think it was always intended that she would be killed, which is tricky.",negative,0.5528
"But by transforming her into this monstrous giant, maybe that made it more acceptable to do her in.",neutral,0.5228
Although she still is done in in a fairly violent way.,negative,0.6061
"These were all long sequences, and it was...",neutral,0.7582
You're just pulling the music out of you.,negative,0.5026
"""Okay, another 20 bars."" Are we done yet?",neutral,0.8639
Another 20 bars of Sturm und Drang.,neutral,0.8707
"Every time I see the end of this movie, the general feeling that I get inside is exhaustion, I remember.",neutral,0.4923
It was my first score.,neutral,0.7454
And I had come through about two-thirds of the way just fine.,positive,0.74
I get to the last third and it's...,neutral,0.7219
Or last quarter...,neutral,0.8594
And it's nonstop wall-to-wall action-adventure hits.,neutral,0.6657
And this was actually in slightly pre-computer days.,neutral,0.7654
"So, it helps that you have, nowadays, in terms of synching cues and all that you didn't quite have then.",positive,0.5703
"Well, it was a transitional time.",neutral,0.6666
It was getting into MIDI stuff and all of that.,neutral,0.8329
"Right, we were just getting into it.",neutral,0.8105
"I was, I think, one of the first people to work exclusively in MIDI.",neutral,0.5958
"And it was an amazing help, because in the beginning of doing the score, I would write the score with the click track, and set up my measures and write the music.",positive,0.9248
"And then I said, ""I want to see how it sounds."" So then, I play it into my computer in MIDI and play it back.",neutral,0.7859
"And at some point in the way, I said, ""Duh!",neutral,0.6104
"Why don't I just write it right onto the computer"" ""and avoid this second step?"" The mermaid on the rock was in the identical pose with the mermaid in Copenhagen.",neutral,0.6461
That was our homage to the iconic statue there in Copenhagen of Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid.,positive,0.6749
"And in terms of Howard's writing contributions, this one may be the biggest of all.",positive,0.8033
This scene was originally played more pantomime.,neutral,0.8475
"The same idea, but without words.",neutral,0.7155
"And then Howard, as we were going through it, I think, feeling that, ""There should be some spoken words here to put this over."" And Howard wrote this little scene with the King and the crab.",neutral,0.8177
And the great thing he did is that he put it in subtext.,positive,0.9213
"Obviously, the King is saying, ""I'm going to change her into a human."" But without ever saying that, he just says, ""There's one problem left.",negative,0.4806
"How much I'm going to miss her."" And that says everything.",neutral,0.4317
And that was Howard Ashman's line.,neutral,0.8288
"I remember talking to Howard, when we were down in Florida when the film was done, and there was, I think, a parade or something where they played music from Mermaid in this parade.",neutral,0.7455
"I remember Howard crying because he thought, ""This movie is going to last beyond me."" And I think that was his first feeling that this actually might move into the culture, move into something, that was going to go beyond his own life.",neutral,0.5339
"And so much of Mermaid is Howard, I think, obviously.",neutral,0.6448
"-He got teary about that, huh?",neutral,0.6187
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
But I think it was because he knew his days were numbered.,neutral,0.515
-And that's for Howard.,neutral,0.8017
He was so vulnerable.,negative,0.6654
A man who was so tough.,neutral,0.6059
He could just tear you out of the room.,negative,0.6393
"You come in, you go, ""isn't this great?"" And Howard would go, ""Well."" We did want to wrap up all the characters here.",neutral,0.6399
-Wedding bells and Louis.,neutral,0.8729
So we brought Louis back.,neutral,0.6789
"Again, Jeffrey felt like the crab needed to give Louis his comeuppance.",neutral,0.7851
"And so, we story-boarded this rather late in the process and animated it.",neutral,0.7749
We had an earlier idea where Louis and the crab become friends.,neutral,0.8253
"And shout, ""Friends, schmiends!"" I still wince slightly at this ""yes"" moment coming up on the crab, but...",neutral,0.4952
Teeth coming out.,neutral,0.7179
"And to give Jeffrey his props, he wanted to add the line, ""I love you, Daddy."" Originally, we didn't have that in that scene.",neutral,0.5572
We just had an over-the-shoulder shot.,neutral,0.8455
"""And he was like,"" Well, you can put that over the shot 'just to cement the..."" And so, here, the first Disney chorus probably for quite a few years.",neutral,0.719
"At first, Howard wasn't so sure about using a Disney chorus.",neutral,0.597
"And he was like, ""Is that too old-fashioned?"" But eventually, I think he thought, ""No.",neutral,0.672
"That actually aligns the movie"" ""with these great Disney classics."" We had to reflect back to the classic Disney score.",positive,0.8984
"Snow White and Pinocchio and all those things, and this was a chance to do it.",neutral,0.7489
"This particular shot right here is actually the first CAPS shot, which is Computer Animated Production System.",neutral,0.8668
"Yeah, rather than using cels in that shot, all the characters were painted in the computer, and that ship was all composited in the computer.",neutral,0.7271
"Then that process later went on to be used completely from The Rescuers Down Under to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King.",neutral,0.5239
But that was its first test run.,neutral,0.8013
It didn't work particularly.,negative,0.8882
We had a lot of problems with it just in that one scene.,negative,0.8736
"Every aspect of this production, you could say we definitely tested the waters -with The Little Mermaid.",neutral,0.5699
-Right.,neutral,0.6232
We were trying things that hadn't been done in a long time.,neutral,0.6373
And we didn't know how to do it necessarily.,neutral,0.5107
"It was a stretch for all of us, I think.",neutral,0.5521
That was fun for us to challenge ourselves.,positive,0.9308
But this established a new mold mandatory for every animated film after.,neutral,0.8271
"It established the idea of an ""I Want"" song, which was not a formula idea within this, but...",neutral,0.8469
And it made the Disney choir okay again.,positive,0.8872
And definitely break into song was okay again.,positive,0.895
And our attempt in all this was we wanted to make a film that reflected our sensibilities.,neutral,0.7923
"And it wasn't a film that you just found like it came from 1940, and you open the vault and there it was.",neutral,0.7156
"And I think it's a testament to the people, Howard and Alan and all of the artists, everyone involved in it, that they tried to put something of their own lives and their point of view into it.",neutral,0.5791
"So, they brought themselves into the movie.",neutral,0.7517
"And that spirit, I think, is what helped make it the success that it became.",positive,0.7185
It was also the film that kind of re-established the idea that animated films could be watched and enjoyed by adults and young people even without children.,positive,0.9017
It's hugely hip among theater audiences.,positive,0.8194
It became a date movie.,neutral,0.7667
"I don't know that anyone expected that, it wasn't made with that in mind.",negative,0.6271
"But it was a film for audiences of all ages, and it lived up to that.",positive,0.8685
"I think that it works on different levels, so that a little kid watching it can watch it in a certain way.",neutral,0.5402

"And Roger Allers, director of Lion King.",neutral,0.5217
And we're here to perform the top 40 hits for you.,positive,0.5334
"No, we're here to comment for you on the making of The Lion King.",neutral,0.5942
"Kind of share some of our experiences with you, right here in your own living room.",neutral,0.7303
"The project started, actually, as King of the Jungle.",neutral,0.9057
"And the original concept was to do a picture in Africa about lions, but no one at the time knew what the story was gonna be.",neutral,0.6485
"Then it kind of evolved from there into being an original story, which is unique for us.",neutral,0.4991
Usually we do stories based on fairytales or novels or bits of literature.,neutral,0.8728
But Lion King was unique in that it was completely out of thin air.,positive,0.844
"Even though it was informed by a little bit of Hamlet, little bit of Old Testament Bible stories like Joseph or Moses, that kind of thing.",neutral,0.8851
"Originally, in the opening of the picture we were going to have a dialog scene to introduce the characters, to introduce baby Simba, introduce Rafiki as the shaman coming to bless the child.",neutral,0.7802
Right.,neutral,0.5665
"Actually, we had scenes of animals walking to Pride Rock.",neutral,0.6744
"And then we had Zazu talking about, ""Everybody, get in the line.",neutral,0.8025
"Get in the line."" There was so much chatter, and at that time also, Rafiki, no one knew who Rafiki was.",neutral,0.6531
"But when we heard Hans' version of how he Africanized Circle of Life, we all just went crazy.",neutral,0.5877
"In four minutes of music, Elton John and Tim Rice, God bless them, created this beautiful… What became an anthem for the movie that defined the spirit of the movie and the theme of the movie.",positive,0.9499
"In the shot where we rack focus from the ants in the foreground to the zebras in the background, that was the concept from the storyboard, where we were literally trying to do something that's very common in a live action picture but is very rarely seen or never seen in an animated picture, which is literally to use the focal length of the camera.",neutral,0.681
But in our case we have to replicate what that might look like under these circumstances where it's artificially done.,neutral,0.7786
And yet gives you that sort of sense that you're really looking at a real world.,neutral,0.7289
"The whole fly-in scene where you reveal the African savanna and you see Pride Rock for the first time, Pride Rock is kind of like the castle for the lions, is all done in one continuous shot.",neutral,0.7303
It's all done in one.,neutral,0.6413
You go from this vast overview of the savanna into a close-up of Mufasa without cutting.,neutral,0.8479
"Now, the great thing with this shot of Rafiki coming up, it gives you the feeling of sunlight filtering through the characters.",positive,0.9075
"And it's all the great CAPS magical tricks that you can do with special effects, animation and graphics.",positive,0.9192
Or the clouds which are actually a flat two-dimensional painting which is skewed by the computer.,neutral,0.5849
"""Skewing"" means it kind of stretches it out.",neutral,0.6973
"And always when we previewed the film, I remember going to the Pasadena theater for the first time where we previewed it, and little Simba turns around for the first time, -always was a surefire ""aw."" It's an ""aw shucks"" moment.",neutral,0.4674
"And the funny thing about Circle of Life, it's a great stand-alone piece because without giving anything about the movie away, it kind of gives you a sense of epic scale in Africa and all that stuff.",positive,0.9318
And it went out in November.,neutral,0.8191
Six months before the movie was released.,neutral,0.8528
"That's right, exactly, and the thing that we were all so worried about was that nobody would know what the title of this movie was, because they hadn't heard it before.",negative,0.6135
That was a big concern.,negative,0.5209
"""Do you think people are gonna go?"" Here's something that the folks in the theater probably would never care about.",negative,0.8799
But we really cared about trying to get all the clouds in the background to match speed.,neutral,0.7002
There are several different paintings of Pride Rock that we had to match from one to the next.,neutral,0.7672
"The cliff he stands on, because you get so close to it, was painted really large so that when you got close the detail was clear for the large movie screen.",neutral,0.6392
"But had to be shrunk down to fit onto Pride Rock, so all those things.",neutral,0.7721
How many levels do you think we had?,neutral,0.8534
How many background levels?,neutral,0.8233
Too numerous to mention at this point.,neutral,0.5392
Those are the sort of things people like to hear -but we don't remember them.,neutral,0.4939
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"That's one of the great things about the CAP system, which is our fancy computerized animation production system, where you can put together seemingly endless levels of animation and backgrounds, and clouds and effects and things, and sandwich them together without being limited by reality because it's all done in a digital universe.",positive,0.9416
"Right, it is the ultimate multi-plane camera.",positive,0.6829
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
We're rarely limited by reality.,neutral,0.7264
"Well, yes, especially you guys.",positive,0.6209
Okay.,neutral,0.5844
Reality unlimited.,neutral,0.5343
"Ah, the mouse.",neutral,0.708
Great scene by Brian Ferguson.,positive,0.9179
"-I think it's interesting… No, he gave us… Sorry.",positive,0.5856
"I was just gonna say that it's interesting that the very first line of dialog you hear in the movie is, ""Life's not fair."" Yeah, 'cause there was no dialog in the opening song at all.",positive,0.4737
"You see, I… Well, I shall never be king.",negative,0.69
"So in that introductory scene, where we've got all the characters talking for the first time, we've got Scar, who was animated by Andreas Deja.",neutral,0.8896
"And Zazu, who was animated by Ellen Woodbury.",neutral,0.906
What's amazing about Ellen is I've never seen anybody get into a character as much as she would.,positive,0.956
She would flap around the studio and pretend she was a bird.,neutral,0.7715
She'd do all the research you could possibly imagine on a hornbill bird.,neutral,0.68
You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you.,negative,0.5723
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.,negative,0.946
"And Jeremy Irons, what a guy he was, huh?",neutral,0.5005
Sure was.,neutral,0.4686
"It's funny, 'cause I think both Jeremy and Rowan Atkinson who plays Zazu here, they were really reluctant about lending their voices to an animated character, because a lot of who they are is their persona and their personality and their appearance.",neutral,0.6101
"And so we had to record a test and animate something so they could see how their characters started to come to life, and then they were seduced by it.",neutral,0.6123
"Actually, I heard an interesting story from Jeremy's agent, who said that they were having dinner together at Morton's restaurant, and a seven-year-old boy walks up to the agent and says, ""Is that Scar?"" And of course it was.",positive,0.6922
This is one of the biggest pieces of background artwork we have.,positive,0.9724
It's a huge 20-field pan.,neutral,0.7305
You'd never know.,neutral,0.5657
"It's interesting about art direction, things like lighting that you never notice or think of as an audience perhaps, but there's a real light direction in the mouth of the cave that comes in, and our effects animators put tone mattes on the characters so that there's a sense of light and dark on the character to create a light direction.",positive,0.6493
Contact shadows under the characters.,neutral,0.7739
Nice growl.,positive,0.7844
"That was always tough, trying to get the lion growl to sort of interface with James's dialog.",negative,0.5338
"Because I remember in some of the sessions, he would do these… ""Is that a challenge?"" Well, Mark Mangini, again, who did some of the growls for the Beast in Beauty and the Beast, had put together real tiger and animal growls with dialog in Beauty, and he used a little bit of that same technique here, where he could play a little animal growl underneath James Earl's voice and get a sense of animal.",neutral,0.8391
What am I going to do with him?,neutral,0.7879
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.,positive,0.9045
Zazu!,neutral,0.5847
"And just think, whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him.",negative,0.7338
"Now, the scenes coming up really were inspired by our trip to Africa.",positive,0.6412
"I mean, these are practically photographs that we brought back with us.",neutral,0.8279
I remember standing out in this field.,neutral,0.78
"I was standing in this field, watching the rain drifting across.",neutral,0.8503
It's a great place.,positive,0.9729
"Huge expanses where the weather can be so separate in different parts… Originally, this scene, the lightning scene -was done without this tree.",neutral,0.7822
That's right.,neutral,0.569
We had to add this tree when we came back to add Rafiki into the sequence.,neutral,0.9245
"We did a preview where Rafiki wasn't as present in the movie as we would like, and so we put him into this sequence at a later date.",neutral,0.71
And added the idea of the icon as well.,neutral,0.8483
"The Simba icon that he was drawing, which actually carries through thematically through the whole piece.",neutral,0.7641
Of course he does have… What was the thing about this?,neutral,0.8192
The pink?,neutral,0.7775
The pink chalk?,neutral,0.839
"Is it pink in his… Yeah, if you look, the color is different in the bowl than it is on what he paints on the thing.",neutral,0.8612
Another little mistake.,negative,0.7511
Dad!,positive,0.4869
Dad!,positive,0.4869
One thing we found out about lions really early is they just sleep all the time.,neutral,0.7993
And this is our sleeping lion scene.,neutral,0.8331
"They sleep together, too.",neutral,0.8753
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"It's interesting how they, in the king and queen's throne room we've got basically everyone else.",neutral,0.5779
It's a commune.,neutral,0.766
Because in nature it's usually one lion and many lionesses.,neutral,0.6867
"Or occasionally, brothers rule a pride, which is what this story is about.",neutral,0.8274
Right.,neutral,0.5665
Interesting.,positive,0.7793
You promised.,neutral,0.6586
"And Jonathan was really incredible, too.",positive,0.9598
We went through so many audition tapes of child actors to find Jonathan who had such a great natural ability to act and had such an interesting quirky voice.,positive,0.8767
"Yeah, he was terrific.",positive,0.9175
And he's also on the cover of Tiger Beat magazine.,neutral,0.7723
-I think that's important to note.,neutral,0.5796
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"Look, Simba.",neutral,0.7336
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.,positive,0.614
Wow.,positive,0.7094
"A king's time… This shot is amazing because it's a camera dolly around the character, which is very unconventional in animation.",positive,0.959
"And to do it, we actually started with kind of a computer framework to show how the camera might move around these characters.",neutral,0.885
"Yeah, we built a very simple model of Mufasa and Simba on the cliff and rotated around so that the animator would have an underpinning, an understructure to put his animation on.",neutral,0.864
"It was Chris Wahl, wasn't it?",neutral,0.8902
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"And Chris followed that computer guideline so you get, in that final scene, a feeling that the camera's actually moving around the characters, which is great.",positive,0.9189
It helps that sense of reality and mood and place.,neutral,0.5368
"That's the kind of thing we are trying to do throughout the whole picture, was take you into the image.",neutral,0.8056
"Yeah, have more of a sense of cinematography.",neutral,0.7108
Exactly.,neutral,0.5663
I always loved this shot.,positive,0.9614
"The idea of sound effects, you hear a little grass with the antelope running through, and you get the huge perspective of antelope in the foreground and then middle ground, and then they show up way in the distance towards the end of the shot.",neutral,0.827
"I was just gonna say not in an animation way, but just in terms of a scripting way, the idea of having Mufasa talk about that they eat other animals was really important to me.",positive,0.6526
I always thought this is a really great idea.,positive,0.9798
"I thought it would be great to ennoble the whole idea of the balance of life, the prey-predator and how it's all connected.",positive,0.7706
"Remember the joke we had at one point where he was saying, ""And we're all connected in the great circle of life."" And we had an antelope off in the distance.",neutral,0.5911
"""Isn't that right, Joe?"" ""Right you are, Mufasa."" ""Catch you later, Joe."" ""Not if I can help it."" Then he takes off in the distance.",neutral,0.7642
There was a song here at one time.,neutral,0.8902
There was a big… Oh.,neutral,0.7209
To Be King.,neutral,0.7433
"To Be King, which was Dad's day out.",neutral,0.7853
"In the storyboard, and in the original outline, it always said, ""Dad's day out."" And it was a male-bonding day between dad and son.",neutral,0.7421
But it just never quite fired up.,negative,0.7015
"You never believed Mufasa out there in the woods, singing and dancing.",neutral,0.5511
Here comes my favorite character in the film.,positive,0.9519
This little sweet groundhog who always in previews got the biggest laugh.,positive,0.888
"He was going to be a naked mole rat, but we couldn't get the thing to look right.",negative,0.6124
But we couldn't get the rights.,negative,0.5836
-He had a tough agent.,neutral,0.7606
It's true.,neutral,0.5889
"We would have lost our ""G"" rating.",negative,0.7817
But it's funny underground humor.,positive,0.7075
It is.,neutral,0.6055
-It's a throwback to World War II.,neutral,0.7719
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
And Hogan's Heroes.,neutral,0.7846
"Yes, and this line.",neutral,0.6339
Setting up the hyenas.,neutral,0.7121

We had a different line there.,neutral,0.7712
"It was a transitional scene trying to not only set up the hyenas, but get you led back to Scar and what he's doing.",neutral,0.8934
Right.,neutral,0.5665
This was also one of the very earliest scenes done.,positive,0.5849
"That's the first scene, wasn't it, of Scar by Andreas?",neutral,0.916
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
First scene animated.,neutral,0.8077
"There's a neat lighting thing going on here, too, because whenever you see young Simba, he's out in the sunlight and looking out over the vast Pride Lands.",positive,0.9072
"And then whenever you see Scar, he's under the overhang of the cliff, in the shadows, symbolically being the nasty one.",neutral,0.5705
Gary Trousdale storyboarded this scene.,neutral,0.8891
"It's funny because you never see the storyboard drawings, but it's always the point of departure for what the scene ultimately looks like.",neutral,0.5272
And so Gary's attitudes and the way this whole scene was boarded out started long before the animation.,neutral,0.5802
"That's Simba, who was animated by Mark Henn.",neutral,0.874
And Scar animated by Andreas Deja.,neutral,0.893
It's really great to see two great animators acting with each other.,positive,0.9895
This is one of the purest scenes where you can see that.,positive,0.9549
"Two great guys who know what they're doing, with great voices to work with, just acting like crazy.",positive,0.9561
"What's interesting is that Andreas was animating Scar in I., and Mark was animating Simba in Florida.",positive,0.7588
And all these things were zapping back and forth across the coast.,neutral,0.7859
And we recorded Jeremy in London.,neutral,0.8701
And Jonathan in Zimbabwe.,neutral,0.825
-No.,neutral,0.5275
That's not true.,negative,0.6974
In the design process we usually start with a conception of the character from the imagination.,neutral,0.8656
"And once we actually attach a voice to it and hire the actor and start recording that actor, then the lead animator of that character takes on that character and literally starts to work with it and define it and refocus it.",neutral,0.8576
And a lot of times they are so influenced by the look of the actor that it can't help but manifest itself in the final design.,neutral,0.6241
I love this shot where Simba is running down the hill past the lionesses basking in the dapple light.,positive,0.9711
"It seems simple, but I remember everybody trying to get the dapple light right because sunlight filtering through trees in animation ain't so easy.",neutral,0.5637
"So, getting the effects animators to work together with the art director and get that feeling, and they did a lovely job.",positive,0.9619
This all came from a pre-production sketch by Andy Gaskill.,neutral,0.8939
"He was just exploring different environments of where the lions would live, and he did this beautiful thing of the lions sleeping on a dappled ledge.",positive,0.7578
And we pretty much just lifted it right off and stuck it right in the film.,neutral,0.8037
We should talk about Niketa a little bit.,neutral,0.8839
We never mentioned her.,neutral,0.6502
-Niketa Calame.,neutral,0.661
Yes.,positive,0.461
Sweet little girl who came in and read along with every little girl in Hollywood to do the voice of Nala.,positive,0.5125
"And we ended up with Niketa, who was really natural.",positive,0.8407
I think that was her forte.,neutral,0.8042
She was just herself and brought so much edge and character to Nala.,positive,0.7385
It was great.,positive,0.9742
"It's actually interesting… I was gonna say that it's interesting because one of the issues we had to deal with in this film was it was taking place in Africa, and although it was animated, how are we gonna cast the characters in terms of their ethnic background?",positive,0.8155
"So, we had James Earl Jones, who's obviously African-American, and we have him with a son who is Matthew Broderick, who is obviously not African-American.",negative,0.4845
"And yet we have Niketa Calame who is African-American, growing up to be Moira Kelly who is not.",neutral,0.5706
"So, we had this big jumble and big mix-up of characters and things.",neutral,0.5211
And what was interesting about this film is that we could really literally be color blind as far as it not mattering at all.,positive,0.7661
"It was really about who the character was, who the performer was and what they brought to the character.",neutral,0.8808
It's almost a nice commentary on how everyone's voice blended together to create this piece of theater.,positive,0.8788
"Also we have Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the voice actor for Simba, and when we go into the song he becomes Jason Weaver.",neutral,0.8765
Right.,neutral,0.5665
"Yeah, who played Michael Jackson.",neutral,0.8116
"The other thing going into Can't Wait to Be King, it was one of the first songs that came in.",neutral,0.7685
And it was meant to be kind of a peppy upbeat kids' point of view of Africa.,positive,0.528
But the challenge was always to try to reflect that in the art direction.,neutral,0.7817
And our production designer Chris Sanders took that challenge on and created a look for this song that was pretty unique to the rest of the film.,positive,0.8457
"Right, it was supposed to be really literally from Simba's point of view, so the idea was to evoke brighter colors and bolder patterns and shapes so that it would feel more childlike.",positive,0.5041
"And interestingly, because we knew we had this departure to make, in terms of going from reality to fantasy, we decided to bring the audience there by a very, very abrupt change so that they would be aware, literally, of the change of tempo and tone and idea.",neutral,0.7327
"The idea during the kind of the trees going by is you got Simba and Nala chasing in one direction, and you have all these palm trees panning by in the other direction.",neutral,0.8643
And the idea was to try to make them strobe by and subconsciously do this little hula thing.,neutral,0.851
Like a zoetrope.,neutral,0.673
"Yeah, Zazu and the rhino butt, a guaranteed laugh.",positive,0.6905
"The log in the river, actually they gave us a little template.",neutral,0.8431
"CGI worked out a little template for the log in the river, again to help us move the characters through a moving camera point of view.",neutral,0.8274
"I love that transition between the ripples in the water into zebra stripes, too, those kinds of things that you can do in a song and maybe not get by with at other places.",positive,0.9431
"One of the problems, too, is if we had taken the animals from The Circle of Life and started having them dance around on their hind feet… Singing and dancing.",negative,0.6314
…it would look really terrible.,negative,0.9204
So we had to go more stylized to allow the animals more free reign to be silly and comic.,neutral,0.6355
"Chris really used African artwork and textiles and patterns and fabrics, and was really inspired by those shapes to put into Can't Wait to Be King.",positive,0.792
The end of this song was storyboarded in a whole different way at one point.,neutral,0.8045
Where were we before?,neutral,0.8523
How did this thing end?,neutral,0.5489
Simba and Nala ran away off in the hills and we saw them from a distance finishing up the song.,neutral,0.8395
"Not much of a punchy ending, so to go really all out, Busby Berkeley, we wanted to put them in the middle of it.",neutral,0.6525
And it turned out to be a laugh riot.,positive,0.7373
The ending shot of this song is really interesting 'cause you basically have a hornbill trapped under a rhino's butt.,positive,0.9283
And you would think maybe there's something funny about this.,positive,0.5106
And we had a recording session with Rowan Atkinson.,neutral,0.9095
The poor guy.,negative,0.8599
"And we gave him 17, no less than 17 different things to say under a rhino's butt.",neutral,0.5632
"Things like, ""Haven't we met before?"" Or, ""I'll never tango again."" All right!",neutral,0.5602
It worked!,positive,0.9049
We lost him.,negative,0.6035
I am a genius.,positive,0.8216
"Hey, genius, it was my idea.",positive,0.6854
"This was setting up a very important point for our movie later on, which is that Nala is gonna pin Simba later on.",positive,0.688
And he has to recognize her.,neutral,0.8068
"Yes, he has to recognize her.",neutral,0.6635
So we thought she should do something physically that he would remember.,neutral,0.8633
So that was what we ended up on.,neutral,0.7829
The Nala flip.,neutral,0.8332
The Nala flip.,neutral,0.8332
"Notice how the art direction changed, too.",neutral,0.8572
"It was kind of bright sunny day above, and once they roll down the cliff, it's all elephant graveyard, moody and mysterious.",neutral,0.532
"You see all that dust moving in the foreground, which is actually done by a computer program.",neutral,0.6072
"There's a brilliant man who worked on our movie named Randy Fullmer, who kind of corralled all this.",positive,0.9327
"His job is artistic coordinator, and he along with Ann Tucker in our scene planning department came up with this idea of turbulence, which you see here in the mist and moving through the elephant graveyard.",neutral,0.783
"Scott Santoro was the head of our special effects department, and normally with special effects you think of rocket ships and laser guns and big explosions, which is absolutely true.",positive,0.5082
But also in animation you have the kind of side of it that's lighting and shadow and subtlety.,neutral,0.8425
"And in almost every shot in Lion King, there's some form of special effect, so in a sequence like this which seems fairly simple, it's loaded with shadows and tone mattes and lighting effects that make the character really feel like it's in its environment.",positive,0.5288
"What tone mattes are, are the shadowed areas on the characters that define the character as a three-dimensional form.",neutral,0.8742
Especially in this film where we had lions who were all one color.,neutral,0.8293
"If we had not had the tone mattes which gave the internal shadows on their bodies, they would have come out looking so flat.",negative,0.6732
"Yellow-gold-orange, yellow-yellow, yellow-brown, yellow-orange.",neutral,0.7813
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
So our effects department pretty much drew shadows on all these characters throughout the whole movie.,neutral,0.8155
"Not a fun task, but, boy, it really made everybody become very three-dimensional.",negative,0.4588
"You can also see in terms of like what the CAP system does, when Zazu's bill goes from yellow to orange, there's a blend happening between those two colors which was something that we're able to do with a computer.",neutral,0.8271
That you couldn't have done five years ago.,neutral,0.5284
"If this were Fantasia back in the '40s, you would have airbrushed all that, and it would have crawled around and been very fragile.",neutral,0.5004
Now you can get a lovely blended look.,positive,0.9188
This is great.,positive,0.9817
"I remember one day we were working on the movie, trying to figure out who to cast for several of the parts, and Peter Schneider walks in and goes, ""Whoopi Goldberg wants to be in your movie."" We hadn't cast the hyenas, in fact, we had read auditions for the hyenas, including Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, who came in to audition for the hyenas, and ultimately were cast as Pumbaa and Timon.",neutral,0.7876
We hadn't quite landed on who would play these characters.,neutral,0.7901
Gary Trousdale had come up with a Cheech and Chong idea.,neutral,0.798
"But we found out that they wouldn't work together anymore, -so we… We kept Cheech.",negative,0.5576
-Ended up with Cheech and Whoopi.,neutral,0.8448
There you go.,neutral,0.5283
"And Ed, who was loosely based on Ed McMahon and Harpo Marx, all mixed together, who could just laugh at their jokes.",neutral,0.6784
"And he was played by Jim Cummings, who we had the most amazing recording session with, 'cause he came in for four hours and basically laughed.",positive,0.978
Every kind of laugh.,positive,0.543
"""Laugh apprehensively."" ""Laugh like Ricky Ricardo."" ""Laugh like Lucy."" As the chase starts, the art direction heats up again, so you really get a lot of reds and stuff on the screen.",neutral,0.6235
That's the great thing about animation is you can light and do whatever you want to so that the art direction can support what's going on emotionally on the screen.,positive,0.9234
"This was funny, pounding on Jonathan's back, so he could do the uh-uh-uh-uh Going down the spinal cord.",neutral,0.5327
"These got to be really complex scenes in here 'cause you had six characters on the screen, on and off, and their shadows and tone mattes.",neutral,0.7398
"This is a great shot, as the cubs round the corner and go past all those foreground cliffs and reveal this big elephant carcass, for lack of a better word.",positive,0.8528
And it's got a little skin on it and they crawl up to the top.,neutral,0.7903
There's a little color pop here.,neutral,0.6547
It's not much to look at.,neutral,0.4975
We couldn't fix it because we ran out of time.,negative,0.8173
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
-Who did those growls for Simba?,neutral,0.849
That was Jonathan.,neutral,0.778
I remember we experimented with real animal growls and young cubs sound like kittens almost.,neutral,0.6391
"This is like a grizzly bear, mixed with a tiger, mixed with a F-16 fly by.",neutral,0.607
One of the big challenges of doing The Lion King was the fact that it was an all-animal story as opposed to many of the other pictures we've done recently which were primarily human based.,negative,0.464
So the entire staff of animators had to learn how to do four-legged animals.,neutral,0.631
"They went to the zoo, they went to Africa.",neutral,0.778
They really lived with these animals.,negative,0.8094
"We had Jim Fowler, who you remember from the old Wild Kingdom show, came into the studio with… ""That's Jim wrestling the anaconda ""while I'm sitting here in the tent."" ""We'll be right back."" Jim came in one day and brought seven lions and lionesses in.",neutral,0.8435
"Cubs, females, males.",neutral,0.8227
Beautiful creatures.,positive,0.9178
And you really get a sense for what their power is and majesty and the feeling of those creatures when you're about three feet away from them with nothing between you but a piece of paper and a pencil.,neutral,0.6423
There was lots of research done.,positive,0.5115
We studied films.,neutral,0.7935
"We went to Africa, watched them in the wild, brought back photographs.",neutral,0.8035
We ate a whole caribou one night.,neutral,0.7484
That was good.,positive,0.9771
I remember that.,neutral,0.7001
"When we showed the film in Japan for the first time, we got absolutely no response.",negative,0.6611
"I mean, no laughter to any of the jokes up until this joke when Zazu says, ""Good luck."" And it gets a huge laugh.",positive,0.8384
It brought down the house.,negative,0.7709
"We all asked afterwards why it happened, and apparently it's a cultural thing.",neutral,0.6529
"When you get in trouble in Japan and you go off to be reprimanded, people will tell you, ""Good luck."" Simba!",neutral,0.5024
An important symbol in the film is when Simba puts his foot in the footprint.,positive,0.5315
"It tells you about the whole film, that someday we'll have to fill our fathers' footsteps.",neutral,0.7848
-It's a visual metaphor.,neutral,0.7661
It is.,neutral,0.6055
The audience related to this scene perhaps more than any other because we've all been in Simba's position here.,positive,0.7339
"Actually, here's an interesting one is that we really were trying to actually do a sunset during the whole course of this sequence so that every single background had to transition from this pink sunset setting to a starry night.",positive,0.8334
Do you know how we did it actually?,neutral,0.863
"For a lot of it, it was just two backgrounds.",neutral,0.7799
A dark one and a light one.,neutral,0.827
And then you just added… We would literally transition pinkness or blueness to it.,neutral,0.7684
It was a percentage.,neutral,0.734
We would have it mostly on the pink and then we would increase the percentage on the starry night as we decreased on the pink sky.,neutral,0.8929
"It's also the point in the movie where we start to introduce the star metaphor, which then became very important later in the film.",positive,0.6257
"Yes, that was actually an invention of Jim Capobianco.",neutral,0.7105
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
It was nice.,positive,0.9653
"There needed to be a way to express the idea of forefathers, generations gone by, in a way that was somewhat spiritual and had a link somehow to the generations gone by.",neutral,0.869
And the stars became that metaphor.,neutral,0.7821
And of course this piece of scoring was not the original piece.,negative,0.5793
"Yeah, Hans had written a piece of score for this whole area.",neutral,0.8892
"-It was quite lovely, but… We changed it.",positive,0.7351
We changed it.,neutral,0.7219
We used it in another place.,neutral,0.8227
You're talking about the theme where we used it for his ascension to Pride Rock.,neutral,0.8807
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
That's where we slipped it.,neutral,0.5995
"Now, if you look at the stars closely, they form the constellation Leo.",neutral,0.7063
Is that true?,neutral,0.8422
It is true.,neutral,0.521
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
Yes.,positive,0.461
"if any of you listening are astronomers, you can please call us.",neutral,0.8732
Although you're not supposed to be able to see the constellation Leo -from East Africa.,neutral,0.5651
From the Equator?,neutral,0.8556
Apparently.,neutral,0.5158
Really?,neutral,0.6008
That's what somebody told me.,neutral,0.783
I bet you could.,neutral,0.5136
-Anyway.,neutral,0.656
I'm no astronomer.,neutral,0.5638
"Man, that lousy Mufasa.",negative,0.8866
I won't be able to sit for a week.,negative,0.8721
"It's not funny, Ed.",negative,0.9181
Jim Cummings' laugh.,neutral,0.6948
"Jim Cummings' laugh, a little more turbulence mist coming up from the… But no tone mattes because we had to cut back.",neutral,0.7483
That's right.,neutral,0.569
We ran out of money.,negative,0.6762
"No, there were places throughout the movie where you have to cut back.",neutral,0.8021
And so you have to pick those moments where it's not going to conflict.,neutral,0.7573
"But interestingly we used that shadowing process so that at the bottoms of the characters, it falls off into shadow, so it does give it a dimensional effect.",neutral,0.7861
"One of the things I think Andy Gaskill wanted to do with this sequence was make it kind of a geothermically unstable place, so you get really theatrical curtains of steam rising up from cracks in the Earth.",neutral,0.7488
"And because, as you know, when we were making this film we went through the Northridge earthquake.",neutral,0.8365
"The big Northridge earthquake, which is incorporated into this song.",neutral,0.8495
"We survived floods, fires, a riot.",neutral,0.5573
A plague of locusts.,negative,0.6691
"And commissary food, all during the making of this film.",neutral,0.8785
"Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us.",neutral,0.8014
"I mean, you're our pal.",neutral,0.7229
Here comes a meat gag.,neutral,0.5166
"Yes, very controversial meat gag.",negative,0.5325
We weren't sure whether we could actually show meat on screen.,neutral,0.495
Can you show meat?,neutral,0.7779
Can you show zebra meat on screen?,neutral,0.7226
"We decided that if it was striped… It was funny, then.",positive,0.5311
Somehow it was funny.,positive,0.8006
Although it had to look like a ham.,neutral,0.7583
Like a cartoon ham.,neutral,0.7156
-It's the Tom and Jerry cartoon ham.,neutral,0.7472
"Yeah, it's kind of a Tex Avery ham.",neutral,0.8494
"And here they're like eating neck ties, so you don't really feel like they are eating meat.",negative,0.648
"See, there goes a necktie.",neutral,0.6263
And the meat used to be pinker.,neutral,0.736
-We grayed it down.,neutral,0.7301
We had to gray it down.,neutral,0.6545
Which of course made it look rancid.,negative,0.8439
Like rotten meat.,negative,0.7461
Which was even worse.,negative,0.9415
Which was much more appealing and PC.,positive,0.7162
Be Prepared is the big villain song.,neutral,0.6794
"And Jeremy Irons, boy, he went through lots of rehearsal, and an eight-hour session at a studio one day to come up with the vocals for this song.",neutral,0.7305
-He did great.,positive,0.9417
He did great.,positive,0.9662
"But by the end of the day, he had blown out his voice.",negative,0.6543
"Most people don't think of Jeremy Irons as a singer, but he was.",neutral,0.646
"He, early in his career, played John the Baptist in Godspell, in the West End in London.",neutral,0.9258
So he really did start out as a singer and performs well in this one.,positive,0.8356
"When this song came in from Elton and Tim, it was called Thanks to Me.",neutral,0.7943
"And the lyrics were, ""Thanks to me it's goodbye Mufasa.",neutral,0.6321
"""Thanks to me little Simba's gone bad,"" or something like that.",neutral,0.5498
"""Little Simba needs prayers."" Needs prayers, yeah, and it was great, but as the story evolved, we wanted the notion that Scar was plotting behind… It was actually in a different place.",neutral,0.5494
Right.,neutral,0.5665
"Originally, it was much longer after the hyenas were waiting to take over, and Scar was putting them off.",neutral,0.8038
It was also after Mufasa was killed.,neutral,0.6874
"Right, it was long after Mufasa was killed, and we were feeling like, ""What?",neutral,0.5605
"It's so late."" It makes much more sense to have a plotting song and really get the juices going for this takeover, -so we moved it up earlier.",neutral,0.5817
The melody stuck.,negative,0.5149
This is a track that Hans Zimmer did in a weekend.,neutral,0.8716
"""We left his studio on a Friday night and said, ""Hans, give us a kind of ""fun, sinister, Cirque Du Soleil thing."" In fact, I don't think we even said that.",neutral,0.5247

"And he came back with, basically, what you hear today.",neutral,0.8378
Carnival in hell was one of our… Carnival in hell was the brief..,neutral,0.5431
"He came back on Monday morning and played this for us, and we were pretty amazed.",positive,0.9713
"And then one of our great storyboard artists, Jorgen Klubien, took the material, and he and Andy Gaskill, our art director, were inspired by Leni Riefenstahl.",positive,0.7687
Kind of fascist documentary stuff.,negative,0.779
And thought maybe we could layer the idea of Scar as the fascist dictator on this whole dynamic of the movie here.,neutral,0.7048
"Well, the idea is when we introduced the yellow lights, was to give you the colors of, like, an old news reel.",neutral,0.8571
So that we colored everything in kind of these old browny yellows.,neutral,0.7687
"Like dirty old yellows and black, like an old news reel.",neutral,0.4856
Especially for mud.,neutral,0.6823
"This scene, in the director's cut, we should replace this.",neutral,0.6357
"Yeah, a lot of debate about this scene in previews, whether it was appropriate, and how much we would lean in the direction of this kind of fascist, fascism-on-parade kind of thing.",negative,0.6767
"And here it kind of turns into that bacchanal in hell, carnival, Mardi Gras in a graveyard feeling.",negative,0.5385
And the earthquake.,neutral,0.663
"This was based on Rob's backyard during the earthquake, actually.",neutral,0.8954
"It's funny, on the early demos of this song, both Rob and Roger and I, all of us sing.",positive,0.8187
"And so for a long time when we were workshopping and trying to get through these songs, -we were the hyenas.",neutral,0.8425
That's right.,neutral,0.569
-Tim Rice sang Scar's part.,neutral,0.9017
Beautifully.,positive,0.8391

This is another Mark Henn and Andreas Deja scene.,neutral,0.8004

"And no props, these characters have no props.",negative,0.615
"They can't hold things in their hands, they're standing on their hands.",negative,0.5919
They have no opposable thumb.,negative,0.6925
"The other thing, I think, that's interesting to note is some of the very long scenes.",positive,0.8911
"What we tried to do is stay on the characters and stay on a shot, rather than over-cutting things to really give you a chance to be with the characters, to let them perform and get across what they were doing.",neutral,0.7403
"Another tip of the hat to Jeremy Irons, I think.",neutral,0.6826
"In a recording session, he would give us 10 and 15 and 20 takes on a different color of the line every time.",neutral,0.8933

"Simba, it's to die for.",negative,0.6876
"Actually, the thing we're really trying to do in this sequence is, we've got several storylines going on, we have to set different things up.",neutral,0.8237
"And it was important to actually keep the thread moving throughout each, so that, again, you were carried through sort of in a seamless way.",neutral,0.5003

"Thom took probably a year and a half, almost his whole career on the movie, to do the stampede, and then we turned it over to the CG department, the computer graphics department, with their animators and technical directors, and they were the ones responsible for bringing the wildebeest stampede to life on the screen.",neutral,0.7328

"Scott Johnston was our CGI supervisor, and he wrangled this whole thing, and it really was a project that took the full three years of production for what amounts to about six or seven minutes on the screen.",neutral,0.4983
What's really amazing is that all of those beasts are really based on a singular run cycle that was created by the CGI department.,positive,0.933
"Then they added on different behaviors like bucks -and kicks, and different things.",neutral,0.7757
Head shakes.,negative,0.4972
Changing leads.,neutral,0.7468
"Yeah, but the program that they invented was something called an avoidance program where they would send the wildebeest, literally moving towards each other, but they would always turn away at the last minute.",neutral,0.6305
So they really replicated what a real stampede would do.,neutral,0.629
"Which is, you've got thousands of beasts running, and they're going to constantly try to avoid each other, so you're getting a complete sense of what it would look like.",neutral,0.554
It's interesting because the reason they did that is because the computer does not recognize what is three-dimensional objects.,neutral,0.4974
The computer would have the actual beast crossing in and out of each other like ghosts if they didn't do this.,neutral,0.6635
"So, in order to have them not occupy the same space, they did that program, which again, underlines the natural behavior of these beasts.",neutral,0.6168
It's odd.,negative,0.4979
It's the first time for us we really tackled flesh and blood characters being animated by the computer.,neutral,0.5245
And the reason the computer graphics guys did it this way is it would be impossible to actually sit down and draw tens of thousands of wildebeest storming through a gorge.,negative,0.4818
"And for Jonathan Taylor Thomas, when we were doing all of this, him falling this way and that way, we actually had to pick him up and fling him around the recording studio so we could get These screams and yells out of him.",neutral,0.7264
"That was the very first scene that was put in color, Zazu hitting the wall.",neutral,0.8356
"That's a really interesting little scene, it just goes by so fast, but the camera dollies from left to right on the sea of wildebeests.",positive,0.9499
"And it goes by really fast, but it's actually a very sophisticated scene because what you're seeing is the entire herd is running at you and changing perspective as the camera dollies to follow Mufasa, as Mufasa doubles back to save Simba.",neutral,0.6388
"Again, that's something that would be very simple to do in live action, but in animation you really have to go out of your way to replicate it.",neutral,0.5696
"The combination of the computer-generated wildebeest, and the hand-drawn animation, all the Simba, Mufasa and Scar artwork, of course, would have been drawn by hand.",neutral,0.823
"And then the effects animators putting in shadows, the turbulence dust on top of it, put together with a hand-painted background, created a pretty amazing effect.",positive,0.8958

It was crucially… These scenes coming up here.,neutral,0.8646
-…important that he not see it.,neutral,0.666
Right.,neutral,0.5665
'Cause then the guilt trip wouldn't work.,negative,0.7116

"Scene coming up, where Simba confronts the body of his father.",neutral,0.8694
We spent a lot of time in story and previewing and discussion.,neutral,0.6543

It was weird.,negative,0.6647
"Because even though these are lions, it's a very human story.",positive,0.5484
"And then Rob came in one day, he saw a Rescue 911 or something, I remember, and you were talking about the woman whose daughter fell into a swimming pool or something, and was running around going, ""Help, please, somebody help me!"" And that kind of panicked attitude you have when you don't know where to turn, and you're just shouting for help, but there maybe isn't any help, and that kind of spawned the idea of Simba running around.",negative,0.505
"He knows it's hopeless, but he's still looking for maybe that last chance that his father could be alive.",neutral,0.6224
"It's one of the most sensitive issues in the film is, literally, dealing with the death.",neutral,0.5777
"Whether or not to deal with it off screen, which is a choice they made in Bambi.",neutral,0.838
"And we decided to go purposefully the opposite direction, for the specific reason to allow Simba to confront the issue of death in a very real, personal and immediate way.",neutral,0.7579
Especially because this is going to be his issue that he has to deal with for the rest of the picture.,neutral,0.6038
The whole idea of Simba's guilt materialized a little later in the game.,neutral,0.7574
-It wasn't an original notion.,neutral,0.6461
No.,neutral,0.4936
That Scar would actually wind Simba up to make Simba believe that his father's death was actually somehow his fault.,neutral,0.612
"But as the story developed, that became pretty central.",neutral,0.517
"It was really necessary because we always had a problem with, ""Why doesn't Simba go back home?"" When he ran away, and was gone for a while, we were always up against the problem of what motivates him to stay away?",neutral,0.5089
"Simba's just having a bad day, you know.",negative,0.7699
If it's not one thing it's another.,neutral,0.6266
It's also interesting to think how these stories track in terms of time.,positive,0.7622
-Because it's very condensed.,neutral,0.702
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
This is all two days.,neutral,0.8097
The beginning of this movie takes place in two days.,neutral,0.8985
"This is interesting, this whole area of the movie was actually animated -flopped or reversed.",positive,0.6738
From right to left.,neutral,0.8184
Simba was escaping from the right to the left.,neutral,0.8384
"And then as the movie was up on reels, pretty deep in the process, ""the guys looked at each other one day and said, ""You know, ""we've established the Pumbaa and Timon jungle"" ""is always off on screen right."" ""But here Simba's escaping to the left."" So this whole chunk was flopped.",neutral,0.5312
-All this.,neutral,0.6846
But actually it really isn't.,neutral,0.4849
I think it was completely unnecessary.,negative,0.9531
"In fact, now that I think about it, I think -we should go back the other way.",neutral,0.7543
"Well, okay.",neutral,0.5967
Whoopi's so interesting.,positive,0.9517
"We recorded her separately from Cheech, and the one time we got them together, they were great together, but most of the time we record them separately, yet it still sounds like they're in the same room together.",positive,0.6231
-I don't know how that works.,negative,0.812
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
I think that's actually something people aren't aware of as much is that we do almost all the actors separately.,neutral,0.5475
And we have to basically bring it all together in the editing room.,neutral,0.8776
"Now we see Simba clearly escaping to screen right, where later we'll find Pumbaa and Timon.",neutral,0.8947

There was a song here once.,neutral,0.8643
Yes.,positive,0.461

Not at all?,neutral,0.5494
No.,neutral,0.4936
"There was once imagined a reprise of Scar's song Be Prepared here, as Scar ushers the hyenas in, seemed to be a bit too much of a stage wait or something.",neutral,0.6198
It was too lively to the mood.,neutral,0.563
"You needed to come down from the death, from all that activity, you needed to have that low point.",negative,0.4962
It was also rubbing the audience's nose in the death.,neutral,0.5459

"There used to be a sequence in here, if I could just ruminate, where Simba was lost and alone in the inhospitable waste.",neutral,0.5611
"There was a little sequence where he was out on the sand dunes, and he was walking in the desert.",neutral,0.9003
Kind of a Lawrence of Arabia thing.,neutral,0.802

"Now, interestingly enough, these vultures used to be characters.",neutral,0.5901
That's right.,neutral,0.569
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
Long ago.,neutral,0.5718
But we tried a bunch of different kinds of vultures.,neutral,0.6905
We tried vultures as newscasters.,neutral,0.649
We had the old Yiddish vultures.,neutral,0.5908
We had the radio announcer vultures.,negative,0.5419

"And it was, like, a scene played out with these vultures as characters.",negative,0.5095
"And it was very funny, really funny.",positive,0.9691
"It was too funny, and it kind of stole the thunder from Pumbaa and Timon.",positive,0.5931
"And so, we knew the audience had to be rooting for Pumbaa and Timon, and we introduced these vultures which we would never pay off later, so we ended up just making them real vultures.",negative,0.524
Make them sinister.,negative,0.5805
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"Now, the funny story is that Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella came in to audition in New York as hyenas.",neutral,0.5308
I think Nathan also came in and auditioned for Zazu's role.,neutral,0.9446
"So, when we were in Los Angeles listening through all the tapes, we were trying to figure out who Timon and Pumbaa should be, and we listened to Nathan and Ernie's hyena audition, and it was so funny.",positive,0.8143
They were so funny together.,positive,0.9545
"They played together so well and seemed so familiar with each other and so friendly, that we said, ""Wouldn't it be great if they were Timon and Pumbaa?"" Even the lines they were reading as hyenas were perfect.",positive,0.9618

"One meal now, or years of feasting in the future?"" And Ernie replied, ""One meal now, definitely one meal now."" And we thought, ""That's Timon and Pumbaa."" Mike Surrey and Tony Bancroft, the two animators that animated Timon and Pumbaa, were Timon and Pumbaa, they embraced them in every way.",positive,0.5766
"Originally, actually, in the earlier version of the story, Timon and Pumbaa used to be children who grew up with Simba in the Pride Lands.",neutral,0.9159
"One of the things we decided to change was to make them outcasts, so that when Simba was exiled, he'd have some friends who could take him under their wing.",neutral,0.8127
"And actually Gary Trousdale, who boarded the earliest version of these two characters, came up with the idea of Pumbaa's delicate condition.",neutral,0.9173
"Because he came up with the joke, ""Hey, kid, pull my horn."" And that's what led us off on that whole… ""Pull my tusk!"" And that's what led us off on this idea that he has a little problem.",neutral,0.498
He has an occasional indiscretion.,neutral,0.6942
"It's, ""You got to put your past behind you."" Look, kid, bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?",negative,0.7599
"Of course, this gets into our issue about guilt and responsibility.",neutral,0.5804
"And which led us to the idea of the song Hakuna Matata, which originally was called The Warthog Rhapsody and covered a whole different idea.",neutral,0.9005
It was just about their fun life and how you get bugs.,neutral,0.5574
It was sort of the way Pumbaa lives.,neutral,0.8759
"You know, live according to Pumbaa.",neutral,0.846
Pumbaa's philosophy.,neutral,0.7827
And what we did is we needed a way to express the idea of Simba turning his back on his responsibility and yet doing it in a way that seemed fun and actually kind of a good thing.,positive,0.7742

"But it has, it has such a great rhythm to it.",positive,0.8909
"Just automatically the whole expression, ""Hakuna matata."" Tim said, ""Well, I'll see what I can do with it."" It's like Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah and Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo, and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.",neutral,0.6998
All those songs wrapped into one.,neutral,0.7334
It's a Disney tradition to come up with words that mean absolutely nothing.,negative,0.5156

It does.,neutral,0.6481

Yes.,positive,0.461
"It's like Que Sera, Sera, kind of thing.",neutral,0.729
"Yeah, that's right.",neutral,0.5581
It's true.,neutral,0.5889
"Actually, when we started off, the thing used to start with Timon's verse, where he sang about how he didn't fit into the meerkat colony.",neutral,0.5957
Meerkats are really social animals.,negative,0.803
"They were very social animals, they all lived in big groups, and they were all supposed to work hard, and he just refused to work.",negative,0.6239
And so did that verse because we just really couldn't get it to work and we decided to cut it out and start with the chorus which was a little radical.,neutral,0.4905
But The Beatles did it.,neutral,0.583
"""Can't Buy Me Love."" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" exactly.",neutral,0.5066

This is Jason Weaver again singing for Simba.,neutral,0.8919

And how do you show that?,neutral,0.7331
-In one scene.,neutral,0.7061
Through dissolves.,neutral,0.7618
"But first we'd go to bugs, which was one of the original concepts for the song.",neutral,0.8417
We wanted the whole song to be about eating bugs.,neutral,0.6086
The old warthog song that used to be in this place was all about fun eating bugs in the jungle.,neutral,0.5408
I don't think we ever got our absolute 100% complete bug song.,negative,0.7284
-Never did that.,neutral,0.5913
"No, that's okay.",positive,0.4932
This works.,positive,0.8163

"Yeah, and you didn't pick up on his transitions.",negative,0.6211

It's the kind of song that sticks to you like glue.,positive,0.5749
"There's nothing like that feeling of walking into a recording session with Jeremy Irons and saying, ""Do you know Lovely Bunch of Coconuts?"" Originally, actually, we had a gag in there, which I was sorry to lose, which was Scar was looking at the skull of the wildebeest, and he says, ""Alas, poor wildebeest, I chewed him well."" There used to be a longer interaction where Zazu said, ""Only you can rule the pride, as only you do."" Trying to say nice things about him.",neutral,0.5373

Right.,neutral,0.5665

This is the star metaphor coming back.,neutral,0.7057
Ruben Aquino did some great animation here.,positive,0.9649
Ruben was the lead animator on the Simba character and was one of the earliest animators on the film and kind of set the style for how these lions would look.,neutral,0.7888

Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"So, we said, ""You know, that's not gonna work."" But we ended up using it in this location, which made a lot more sense to do it to literally be annoying.",neutral,0.45
I think these scenes of Rafiki are great.,positive,0.975
James Baxter is the animator of Rafiki and one of the great animators at the studio.,positive,0.8869
He really is.,neutral,0.5606
"It's interesting 'cause James animated Belle, in Beauty and the Beast, and he animated Roger Rabbit.",positive,0.8316
"It's interesting because animators can crawl into the skin of so many different characters, so for somebody to animate Belle and to turn around and animate Rafiki, it shows you the kind of vast range that animators can have, and certainly James is amongst the best.",positive,0.922
"Okay, so this is Simba going into… It's interesting 'cause what we talked about is this whole twisted, gnarled vine area was sort of to reflect Simba's unconscious mind that he was literally going back, peeling through the layers, weaving through to go back, to get to, sort of, -the center of his problem.",neutral,0.6184
Right.,neutral,0.5665

I like the moiré patterns of the water reflecting up… It's very poetic stuff.,positive,0.957
"""Look down there."" You see?",neutral,0.7882
"And again it's great special effects animation, in a very subtle way, from Scott Santoro and the gang.",positive,0.9643
Simba.,neutral,0.5794
"The Mufasa's ghost scene started with Tony Fucile, the lead animator on Mufasa, drawing the performance to James Earl Jones's voice in a really rough manner, and then that went to the effects guys, and Scott Santoro and Ed Coffey and a lot of the effects animators then took those roughs and turned them into cloud shapes and negative shapes and elements that were combined together to create that effect.",neutral,0.8147
"Yeah, also, what we were trying to do with the ghost scene was to bring Mufasa in as a negative shape and then slowly transition, so that the lighting effects would come around to the front, and eventually describe him as a three-dimensional form, up until the sort of climactic scene where you finally see Mufasa in a more dimensional, real state.",neutral,0.8519
"You know, we recorded James Earl Jones in a really interesting way for this scene.",positive,0.8301
"Because his voice is such an instrument, a musical instrument.",positive,0.5491
And our sound designer got an idea to actually put microphones around his head.,neutral,0.8093
We had about six microphones.,neutral,0.8747
"So, in a theater environment where you get a left-center-right surround kind of environment, we actually recorded him with five microphones around his head, which was quite a shot.",neutral,0.7915
It was supposed to make it sound like his voice was coming -from inside of your head.,neutral,0.7561
Right.,neutral,0.5665
"I remember sitting around in my office, late one night with a box of cold pizza, trying to figure out how to physicalize this scene, and how to turn it into a moment that wasn't just talking heads.",neutral,0.7475

That's the whole movie.,neutral,0.6684
"""It doesn't matter."" Right, in those two lines.",neutral,0.6746
"""It's in the past."" And it's funny, after previewing it, we actually opened up a little after that line, because the audiences would just roar with… Particularly the adults.",positive,0.703
It was just a real knowing laugh.,positive,0.7878
"It's like, ""Yeah, that's how life is."" And so, we ended up adding more animation there because it stepped on all the rest of the lines.",neutral,0.5418

It was fun to be able to put these guys together.,positive,0.9635
They hadn't been together for the whole film.,neutral,0.6151
"We had a much longer scene with these characters, once they got into the cave, which of course… We thought, ""Wouldn't it be funny to put the three hyenas,"" ""Pumbaa, Timon and Zazu, all in one high comedy scene."" Right, and originally Pumbaa got them out of the scene, out of trouble, by resorting to flatulence.",neutral,0.6173
Using his secret weapon!,neutral,0.6513
His secret weapon!,neutral,0.7005
"And he cleared the cave, and then the last one out was Zazu.",neutral,0.8281
"Who said, ""You should have let them kill me.",negative,0.7793
"Oh!"" A lot of this fire coming up is turbulence fire in the same method that creates the smoke.",negative,0.5018
"Turbulence was discovered kind of as an accident, wasn't it?",neutral,0.5661
"It was like galvanized rubber, you know.",neutral,0.6369
"They were looking at a monitor one day and these interesting patterns were appearing, and they kind of got into it and found, ""Oh, this is an effect."" ""This is something we can actually harness and use in our movies."" Randy Fullmer was really instrumental in pulling these things together, when we were putting together the fight against the fire, against the fire background, where all of a sudden one of the things came back wrong.",neutral,0.5321
"It was just absolutely weird, the colors were all blown out, but we all looked at it and said, ""Now, there's something interesting about this."" It had kind of a flame-like look.",positive,0.615
"So Randy researched where the problem came from, and we actually wound up using it for flame effects in the climax.",neutral,0.8347
"Basically, they would design a block, a literal sort of marbled cake, if you will, that slices would be taken through and photographed, and as each slice was removed, you would see a differing image of that turbulence.",neutral,0.861
"So the shapes morph and modulate from one to the next, so it gives you the feeling of just a random and organic pattern.",neutral,0.8106
"The embers is a really cool computer trick where the CGI guys create these little embers that actually turn in space and are very dimensional, so on the big screen they look quite real and they glow hot.",positive,0.9589
"And then you have levels of churning smoke behind, which is a combination of drawn artwork and turbulence and diffusion put over the top of it, to really create the inferno feeling down below.",neutral,0.7301
"This was sort of an interesting experiment, trying to achieve that kind of slow motion effect that, again, you can do in live action.",positive,0.9095
And we had to simulate that by literally dissolving from one frame to the next.,neutral,0.6525
"And that scene where he kicks him off, there's an inter-cut of about eight frames or so.",neutral,0.8276
-Eleven frames.,neutral,0.8054
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
Of Simba kind of gritting his teeth before he kicks him off.,neutral,0.6939
"Exactly, that's right, that's the one that we added.",neutral,0.6853
"It was the very last scene that we animated… It was added, like, a month before the movie came out.",neutral,0.854
We previewed it and it just seemed like something was missing.,negative,0.7454
"And it was a conscious expression on Simba's face, he was gonna kick this guy's butt.",neutral,0.6547
"And that was a little eight-frame scene that was lodged in there, and kind of cemented that section of the movie.",neutral,0.8276
That's what I heard.,neutral,0.774
Ed?,neutral,0.7149
"I always liked that we had Scar done in by his minions, you know.",neutral,0.5086
He was foisted on his own… Hoisted on his own petard.,neutral,0.5001
A Shakespeare thing.,neutral,0.7986
And then the rains came.,neutral,0.6449
"All of this heavy, heavy effects work going on in here.",neutral,0.6477
"Glowing embers, rain, fog.",neutral,0.6975
"There's Zazu saying a line, which… Says, ""Your majesty."" Which then we took out because we wanted it to be silent.",neutral,0.7908
"Yeah, it kind of broke the magic of the moment, but… You can play it back and go… If you want to.",neutral,0.6782
"If you like to lip sync along at home you can say, ""Your Majesty,"" along with Zazu right there.",neutral,0.5975
Here's Rafiki pointing to the throne.,neutral,0.9257
I always saw this as kind of the Arthur-Merlin moment.,neutral,0.7874
It is time.,neutral,0.6862
"Actually, I think we have a Don Hahn scene.",neutral,0.781
"Roger and Rob, and even Don… Don, that's right.",neutral,0.5773
…have animated scenes in this film.,neutral,0.8899
It's our Alfred Hitchcock turn.,neutral,0.8256
It's the close-up of Simba's feet walking up.,neutral,0.8434
And there it is.,neutral,0.5731
There it is.,neutral,0.5908
"Thank you, everyone.",positive,0.9456
There was a whole another ending of the movie.,neutral,0.7574
"Yeah, where Timon and Pumbaa brought the baby bugs and… They had a nice little birthday present for the new little cub, and it was a little bug.",positive,0.7843
"It was the same general concept, just done differently.",neutral,0.8258
"Right, it was the goop on the forehead from Rafiki and all that.",neutral,0.8165
We thought we needed another comedy pay-off for each of the characters.,neutral,0.7782
And it was just too long.,negative,0.8379
"It was too tedious, and we felt like, ""Let's go out in a big way,"" and we came up with the idea of, ""Let's end it like we've cut back in after all the ceremony"" ""to the moment where everyone is cheering."" It's a curtain call, almost.",negative,0.4876
"Because, when Simba roars, that's the end of the movie, -and you're going for your handbag.",neutral,0.6461
That's right.,neutral,0.569
It's also nice to get that little curtain call of the characters standing out there on Pride Rock.,positive,0.9531
That was one of the reasons we changed it.,neutral,0.8388
"Because when we started, we started on the cub, and it wasn't clear who the parents were.",neutral,0.6573
It wasn't clear which cub this was.,neutral,0.7248
"So to begin with Simba and Nala standing on the rock, and then introduce Rafiki and the cub… It also ended up with a wide shot of Pride Rock.",neutral,0.849
A lot like Circle of Life ended up.,neutral,0.6402
"You know, with the big establishing shot.",neutral,0.6985
"And that just seemed so right since you were intimate with their characters and all our heroes are there together to introduce the cub, to just say, ""Let's end on the next generation.",positive,0.8028
"""And here's Fluffy, Simba's and Nala's new little cub.",neutral,0.6622
"- ""Let's just end on Fluffy."" Right.",neutral,0.7058
"I was surprised, just looking at it again, how many callbacks there are, even little things like the way Pumbaa and Timon bust up the vultures is the same way they run in and bust up the lionesses and the hyenas.",neutral,0.5856
"And the way Mufasa and Sarabi are at the beginning, is the way Simba and Nala are at the end, and cub Simba running off to the jungles is the same as adult Simba coming back, and, you know, how many callbacks are in the movie to try and knit it together in that kind of circular theme.",neutral,0.8647
Exactly.,neutral,0.5663
It's interesting.,positive,0.8541
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
"I also didn't realize, looking at it again, how much of an effects tour de force it is.",neutral,0.5532
"If you took out the effects animation, whether it be the shadows or the rain or the reflections, or the fire, it would be greatly diminished.",neutral,0.5061
"There's so many unsung heroes in the animation process, -and certainly… Absolutely.",positive,0.5999
The effects tell some of the story.,neutral,0.7678
It's impossible to get around it.,negative,0.5275
"I mean, Mufasa's ghost, reflections in the water, the Pride Lands ablaze, so much of it tells you information you need to know about what the context of the movie is.",neutral,0.829
It would be impossible to tell without it.,neutral,0.6052
Yeah.,neutral,0.5491
A lot of..,neutral,0.7714
This is really… Animated films are about the process as much as anything else.,neutral,0.6469
"And there always comes a point where you have to finish, you have to end your relationship with any piece of this.",neutral,0.528
"And every time you commit to it, every time it becomes sort of solidified, and you know, there's always a sense of is it all that it could be, could we have done something better with it?",neutral,0.5498
"And some pieces, of course, you feel, ""You know, we succeeded pretty well."" And of course, there's other pieces where you say, ""You know, maybe we could have gone for it."" It's tough.",positive,0.5021
"It's knowing when to stop, because it's never about money either, it tends to be more about time, because the meter is ticking, the release date's set, you have a movie to turn out, and it's always in many cases, compromise.",neutral,0.7041
"And I think we were fortunate in a lot of cases not to have to compromise, and, again, people like Randy Fullmer and certainly Andy Gaskill, helped us craft a look of the movie that was pretty seamless.",positive,0.8867
They took us through places where we had to cut back because of time.,neutral,0.712
"And found other solutions that would help us through it, that would soften the absence, you know.",neutral,0.5847
"Like, for example, if we couldn't do the certain effect in that one area, they'd come up with another solution that would be a simpler effect, and yet it would keep the production value up.",neutral,0.7268
Their contribution is incredible.,positive,0.9333
"So, you never had that sense where you're riding along the movie, and all of a sudden… It takes a production dip.",neutral,0.5817
"There was a lot of creative monkeying going on back there, in those colored model stations.",neutral,0.6427
That's a really good point.,positive,0.9684
"Well, it's interesting because a lot of people think our characters and a lot of our films are created by computer, but nothing could be further than the truth.",positive,0.4685
Because it's artists who have always driven these movies and certainly who have made Lion King.,neutral,0.6436
"So, in a way, animation's still created the old-fashioned way where somebody sits down at a drawing board with a pencil or a paint brush and draws or paints animation or a background by hand.",neutral,0.8346
We use computers then heavily in the post-production process to sandwich all those hand-done elements together to create the final frames.,neutral,0.8715
"And we also use computers in an area called CGI, or computer graphics imagery, to animate or create things on a screen that you couldn't possibly do by hand like the wildebeest stampede.",neutral,0.5455
"And the other thing I find interesting, too, is, we were talking about how around the world these movies are put together, that you literally have lines that cut together or pieces of song that cut together, where one word was sung in New York, another was done in Los Angeles, the chorus was recorded in London, and the music was done in Santa Monica.",positive,0.6815
"You know, it's spread out all over the place, and somehow that all comes together into one piece.",neutral,0.5425
It's the magic of animation.,positive,0.6351
It is magical.,positive,0.9436
"In fact, one of the big questions that we're always asked is, ""How do you direct an animated film?"" And the thing is rather than in a live action film where you have all of your elements together at one moment to work with, to put them all on film, in animation you're literally picking up elements scattered from all sorts of different places.",neutral,0.6484
"And you're taking all the bits and pieces of the puzzle and putting them together, and as a director that's pretty much what your job is.",neutral,0.6419
"Managing, designing, juggling all the pieces of the puzzle so that when it does come together, it makes sense and means something.",positive,0.5764
"And that about sums it up, in the Circle of Life.",neutral,0.7789
