1
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,550
I don't see her.

2
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,113
The shift changes.
Just give it a couple of minutes.

3
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,622
You guys sure about this?

4
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,823
Yeah yeah, works all the time.

5
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,130
Besides, this lady loves Lynch.

6
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,466
- Loves him.
- I'm cute.

7
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,740
Is that...
is that her?

8
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,678
Shit.

9
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,994
Parker, what you could do

10
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,228
is go down there and look beautiful
and smile.

11
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,896
- What? Me?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,268
Uh, no.

13
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,433
No no, this is your thing.

14
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,411
All you have to do is go
over there and say, like,

15
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,913
"Hey, me and my friends... "

16
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,041
Girlfriends.
Say girlfriends.

17
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,075
"Me and my girlfriends totally
forgot our credit cards

18
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,418
so we can't get our lift tickets
from over there.

19
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,253
- So can you, like, help us out?"
- That is so lame.

20
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,850
- Give me my money back.
- Your money.

21
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,361
- It's not gonna work.
- Take this. Start at 50.

22
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,227
That's what the other
lady usually takes.

23
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,459
And just, you know,
work your way up if you need to.

24
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,128
- Dan...
- Hey, look at me. Look at me.

25
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,967
You're gonna be fine.
You'll be great.

26
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,973
Parker, you've so got this.

27
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,204
Yeah, and what's the worst
that can happen?

28
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,973
The guy says no.

29
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,778
And he's not gonna say no.
No one's ever said no.

30
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,875
Dan, you do it.
I feel stupid.

31
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,319
Relax, okay?
I promise, you're gonna be great.

32
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,483
- Why me?
- That's 'cause you're a girl.

33
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,983
A beautiful...
hey, you're a beautiful girl.

34
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,563
And you have a charming smile.

35
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,564
Just...

36
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,704
just...

37
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,506
There we go.

38
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,175
That's great.
Go get him.

39
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,851
- Get in the game.
- Okay.

40
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,912
come on.

41
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,420
Attention all skiers.
The Black Dog Trail is now open.

42
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,794
Sorry for the inconvenience.

43
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,135
Hey.

44
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,837
can I bum a smoke?

45
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,688
- I'm Parker.
- Jason.

46
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,029
Oh cool.
My brother's name is Jason.

47
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,126
That's awesome.

48
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,196
Yeah, so I don't want to waste
your time or anything

49
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,539
because you seem like
a wicked busy guy and everything.

50
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,477
This is gonna sound really stupid.

51
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,141
It's just that my girlfriends and I

52
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,150
came all the way up
from Salem State.

53
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,210
I was kind of the dumbass
who said that I could pay

54
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,188
for all three of the tickets
on my mom's credit card.

55
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,919
And then I left her credit card
at the gas station.

56
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,086
- Right.
- No, I mean...

57
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,891
I totally have money.

58
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,023
Just not enough for all three,
you know?

59
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,500
- How much?
- 50?

60
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,327
I could lose my job.

61
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,531
No no, he's not going for it.

62
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,668
Yes he will.
Just shut up, please.

63
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,839
I mean he's either gonna do that job for...

64
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,507
what do you call it, minimal?

65
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,016
- Minimum.
- Minimum wage,

66
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,019
or he's gonna do it for minimum wage
plus a little bit.

67
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,180
I mean, I know what I'd do.

68
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,293
She just had to come
skiing today, huh?

69
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,359
You said you wouldn't mind.

70
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,197
I don't. I don't mind.
I don't mind at all.

71
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,401
I'm just saying we haven't seen you
at Fezzywigs for a $1 pitcher

72
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,136
since last semester and you don't
show up for Monday Night Football.

73
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,406
I watched football
at your house last week.

74
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,710
Dan, 10 minutes. Football games
are more than 10 minutes.

75
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,444
They're like lots of 10 minuteses,
you know?

76
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,145
I have a girlfriend now.

77
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,380
I don't know what you want
me to do about it.

78
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,979
- I'm sorry.
- You know what? It's fine.

79
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,423
I'm... I'm just just saying that
Mt. Holliston was kind of our thing.

80
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,620
And she can't even ride
so it's a little weird.

81
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,289
- She's getting better.
- Yeah yeah.

82
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,663
Now I feel like a dick.

83
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,225
I mean, if you had a problem with this,
you've got to say something.

84
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,727
No no, it's not a problem.
Just forget I said anything.

85
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,331
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,899
Woman on P. A:
Attention all skiers.

87
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,173
Mt. Holliston will be open
next Friday through Sunday.

88
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,942
Get your tickets now
to avoid waiting in line.

89
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,760
Okay.

90
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,494
I think you did great.
I'm proud of you, Parker.

91
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,699
- I did good, right?
- You did well.

92
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,109
So where's my change?

93
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,111
Um, there isn't any.

94
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,113
You just gave him the full 100?

95
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,547
Well, yeah.
He wasn't gonna do it for 50.

96
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,519
Okay, so what happened to
the numbers between 50 and 100?

97
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,454
Like, say, 51

98
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,548
or 75 even?

99
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,685
Dan, you gave me two 50s.
Was I supposed to ask for change?

100
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,195
I would have asked for change.

101
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,892
I mean, it's still way cheaper
than paying for tickets, right?

102
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,732
I definitely would have
asked for change.

103
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,834
Hey.

104
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,708
Girlfriends?

105
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,474
What's up?

106
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,648
Look at these chumps paying
top dollar for their lift tickets.

107
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,023
- Whoo-hoo!
- Not us, though.

108
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,358
Thanks to you, babe.

109
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:20,058
Oh, now I'm babe.

110
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,431
You never call me pet names.

111
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,369
- I'm not a pet name guy.
- Hmm.

112
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,202
He calls me Parker.

113
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,039
- That's your name.
- I know.

114
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,272
But you're supposed to
call me something affectionate

115
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,542
like honey or sweetie.

116
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,845
You know, I hooked up
with a girl last semester

117
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,512
that called me my last name in bed.
It was weird.

118
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,681
She was all like, "Oh, Lynch,
your hair's so soft.

119
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,783
Do me harder, Lynch. "
It was like throwing it to Dan over here.

120
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,726
Yeah, I could call you O'Neil.

121
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,856
You don't touch
my face enough either.

122
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,629
Third wheel.

123
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,898
- Watch it, Lynch.
- Hey, I'm not dating you.

124
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,928
You don't get to make my life suck.

125
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,270
- Whoa! No no no.
- Whoa.

126
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,969
No one ever said anything

127
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,308
about you making my life suck.

128
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,279
- Uh-huh.
- Sweetie.

129
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,441
Aw.

130
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,314
So Dan tells me you're getting
a little better on that board.

131
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,050
Well, I don't know about that.

132
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,752
Last time I did pretty good, didn't I?

133
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,421
Yeah.
Yeah, you're getting better.

134
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,157
You fall on your ass snowboarding.

135
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,789
The first few times
you fall on your ass.

136
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,232
After that it's easy.
It's like riding a bike.

137
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,800
Just tell me, when are you gonna
get rid of those goddamn skis?

138
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,639
- come on.
- What?

139
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,341
I mean, snowboards are just
too emo for me.

140
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,407
Those things are a fad.
In 10 years they'll be gone.

141
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,851
Yeah, that's what they said about rap.

142
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,912
That's true.

143
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,423
can you guys smell
that fresh mountain air?

144
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,656
It smells a bit like...

145
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,498
cancer.

146
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,266
You know what?
I am so sick of potheads

147
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,862
giving me shit about smoking butts.

148
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,807
- At least pot does something for you.
- Oh.

149
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,003
Yes, cigarettes are just gross,
especially in the cold.

150
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,807
They stick to you.
You smell like

151
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,644
an ashtray,
an old man's used floss.

152
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,776
Old man's... where the hell do you
come up with this stuff?

153
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,344
Okay, have you ever
smelled your floss?

154
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,856
No, I have never
smelled my own floss.

155
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,552
- Never. Not once.
- Well, it's nasty. It is nasty.

156
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,619
- Why am I friends with you?
- I don't know.

157
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,029
Here, give me a drag.

158
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,192
Do you guys know
when we're gonna get back?

159
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,797
'cause I've got like two weeks
worth of chapters to read.

160
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,569
Oh come on.
She broke the first rule.

161
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,543
- Parker, you broke the first rule.
- What?

162
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,307
You can't talk about real life shit
while we're up here.

163
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,577
The whole point of being here
is to forget about all that shit,

164
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,049
- relax, enjoy ourselves.
- Okay.

165
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,483
Deal with that shit
when you get home.

166
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,488
Okay, but I've got...

167
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,493
Okay, what asshole couldn't
get on the chair right?

168
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,763
- What the hell, right?
- Dude.

169
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,532
Oh, that's good.
Yell more.

170
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,009
- Hello!
- Having fun up there?

171
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,238
Parker, it's okay.

172
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,769
Is someone afraid of heights?

173
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,839
- No.
- No?

174
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,580
So it doesn't bother you
when I do this?

175
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,282
- Quit it!
- Don't be an asshole.

176
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,755
Stop.

177
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,190
Sorry.

178
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,853
Honey, crazy thing.

179
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,693
Only one of these things
has ever fallen off

180
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,393
a chairlift thing before.

181
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,892
Okay,
points for calling me honey.

182
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,405
But you just made that statistic up.

183
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,807
Yeah, and statistics don't work
on smokers.

184
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,612
come on, man.
We paid good money to ride.

185
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,706
Let's go!

186
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,377
Actually, I paid good money.

187
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,546
Actually, I'm gonna pay you back,
so it's like the same thing.

188
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,988
- Okay.
- Okay.

189
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,492
What, do you want it now?

190
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,994
All right, that's what I'm talking about.

191
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,896
Whoo!
You guys ready?

192
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,432
- Why do I have to wear a helmet?
- Safety first.

193
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,634
But you guys aren't wearing helmets.

194
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,575
Only kids wear helmets.

195
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,602
That's 'cause they're still learning,
like you.

196
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,308
Here, I'm not arguing about this.
Just put it on. Here.

197
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,010
No, Dan, I don't want...

198
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,282
Look, even the pro guys wear helmets.
Nobody makes fun of them.

199
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,647
Aw.

200
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,750
You guys are just doing this
to make fun of me.

201
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,090
Dan:
No, huh-uh.

202
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,961
Parker:
Oh yeah, sure.

203
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,592
No, I think chicks in helmets are hot.

204
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,296
- Right?
- Yeah.

205
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,642
- Need a little help?
- You think?

206
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,769
Yeah, looks like your bindings
are a little loose.

207
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,939
come on, I'll get you up.
come on.

208
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,676
There you go.
I'll just tighten these up for you.

209
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,207
- Thanks.
- No problem.

210
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,345
Aw.

211
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,218
Look at Lynch.

212
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,157
Yeah, look at him.
He's a chick magnet.

213
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,487
- These all right?
- Yeah, that's a lot better.

214
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,294
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- What's your problem?

215
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,856
- I'm trying to help her.
- Ryan!

216
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,462
- He had his hands all over you.
- No he didn't. I can take care of myself.

217
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,530
Just go, okay?
I'll be there in a second.

218
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,711
I am so sorry about that.
He can be such an asshole sometimes.

219
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,046
I was seriously just trying to help.

220
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,916
I mean, I don't know if I can compete
with a catch like that.

221
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,990
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

222
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,993
Well, thank you for your help.

223
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,257
I'm really sorry about that.

224
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,196
- I'm Shannon, by the way.
- Joe.

225
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,222
Shannon, come on.

226
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,599
Well, it was really nice to meet you.

227
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,503
- Yeah, you too.
- I've got to go.

228
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,406
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah.

229
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,347
I was like a second away
from kicking that guy's ass.

230
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,010
Yeah, I know you were, Lynch.

231
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,179
Don't worry about it.
He's a douchebag.

232
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,519
Seriously, that guy was such a dick.

233
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,525
Why don't we talk about how tough
you guys are at the bottom?

234
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,024
I'm tough.

235
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,727
I know you are, baby.

236
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,394
come here.

237
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,568
Whoo!

238
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:46,116
 How can you say there are no answers
to my questions? 

239
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:51,088
 You just called once
to let it go 

240
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:55,992
 How can you say that none
of this is really worth it 

241
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:00,328
 When we've already won? 

242
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,736
 When we've already won. 

243
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,443
What?

244
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,458
Oh, she told you that?

245
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,365
Yeah, we'll go to Okemo, Killington.
We'll just go up north.

246
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,266
- We'll get away for a while.
- Let's do it.

247
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,362
- christmas, you and me.
- Deal.

248
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,034
Listen, it's not like out West where,
you know, it's like a commercial.

249
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,771
You've got to ride three lifts to get to
the top, it's like perfect powder.

250
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,301
Let's be honest,
it's not gonna be like that.

251
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,644
Yeah, well, speaking of good skiing,

252
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,480
riding the bunny hill
has been fun all day,

253
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,614
but, you know, I think I'd like to do
an actual run before we leave tonight.

254
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,058
Look, if you want to go off on your own,
you don't have to hang out with us all day.

255
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,290
No no, it's fine. I'm just saying
I'd like to step it up at some point.

256
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,798
You know, it's been amazing watching
Parker fall on her ass all day,

257
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,232
but, you know, it'd be cool to...

258
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,998
do some real skiing.

259
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,370
I think I've had enough
skiing for today anyway.

260
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,170
So I can just stay here at the lodge

261
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,677
if you guys want to do more.

262
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,010
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean it like that.

263
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,878
That's not what I meant.
I don't know what I meant.

264
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,680
I told you I didn't...
I didn't have to come.

265
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,552
No no no, Parker,
I didn't not want you to come.

266
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,886
No, he was the one who suggested
you come in the first place.

267
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,983
Okay okay.

268
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,587
The last thing I want
to do is intrude on guy time.

269
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,756
I will not be offended.

270
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,766
I have a lot of things I can do here.

271
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,065
Actually, why don't you give me the key
and I'll go check my messages?

272
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,004
Not to the locker, no.
You're gonna...

273
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,007
come sit down for a second.
come here.

274
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,703
All you're gonna get is a bunch
of messages from your mom

275
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,212
complaining about this,
complaining about that.

276
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,680
No, I'm not gonna give you the key.

277
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,344
I'm sorry if I ruined
skiing for you today.

278
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,877
You didn't.
Honestly, you didn't at all.

279
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,379
You missed the whole part of
the conversation before you walked up

280
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:10,020
where I was saying, like, um...
what was I saying?

281
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,893
I was saying, like,
"Dude, this has been really cool.

282
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,694
I'm glad that we sort of had
this chance

283
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,201
to bond as a threesome. "

284
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,763
What?

285
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,741
No, I mean, I've seen you
fall a couple times today.

286
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,405
But Dan, I mean, I think
it took him maybe three months

287
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,438
before he could even stand on that
thing without looking like a total idiot.

288
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,042
No offense, buddy.
Just the truth.

289
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,246
Joe.

290
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,222
I will catch up with you guys.

291
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,748
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

292
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,954
I just... I wanted to apologize again.

293
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,897
Yeah, it's no big deal.

294
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,490
He's just lucky
he didn't make me mad.

295
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,058
I only look half your boyfriend's size.

296
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,229
Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend.

297
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,934
We're, you know, trying to
still be friends and everything.

298
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,943
But as you can see,
it's not really gonna work out.

299
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,569
No way.

300
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,012
A group of us all agreed
to go skiing this weekend.

301
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,846
Well, whatever. It's this whole story
and I don't want to hold you up.

302
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,411
But that was just
really embarrassing

303
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,013
and I just wanted to say sorry.

304
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,751
That's no problem.

305
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,656
Um, are you gonna be here
next weekend?

306
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,185
Yeah yeah, probably.

307
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,688
My roommate and I come up like every
Sunday, so maybe I'll see you around.

308
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,861
That would be a nice time.

309
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,532
- Okay.
- I guess I'll see you then.

310
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,099
- Great. Good night.
- Good night.

311
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,477
come on.
You know what?

312
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,881
can I just get your number so I know
how to catch up with you?

313
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,680
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

314
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,812
Shit, I don't ski with a phone.
You have a pen?

315
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,119
I don't ski with a pen.
Sorry.

316
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,057
All right, you know what?
Just shoot.

317
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,457
I've got a pretty good memory.

318
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,292
I've only smoked pot like 500 times
so I'm good.

319
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,895
Dan:
How can they afford to close early?

320
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,867
You're only open three days
out of the week, man.

321
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,233
Why don't you write a letter?

322
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,737
Why don't you give me
my money back?

323
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,204
What money?

324
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,731
We're only had, like, four runs.

325
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,538
- can you give us a break, please?
- 830.

326
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,204
- What?
- Just remember 830.

327
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,714
- Just one more time, please?
- Sorry.

328
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,717
I'd give you more money
but I gave it all to you.

329
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,651
Hey, you got a pen?

330
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,519
It's not about the money.
We got weather coming in.

331
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,854
We're trying to clear the mountain.
There's nothing I can do.

332
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,658
Okay, what if we run straight down?
Like the quickest run ever?

333
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,822
We'll be, like, wicked fast.

334
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,426
We gave you 100 bucks.

335
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,937
come on.

336
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,373
Please?

337
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,040
- Hurry.
- Like I said, wicked fast.

338
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,676
- Like the wind.
- 7860.

339
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,692
Seriously, for 100 bucks you'd figure
the guy would cut us some slack.

340
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,223
No shit.

341
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,429
I thought they were open
till 10:00 on Sundays.

342
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,200
What ever happened
to night skiing?

343
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,141
Wachusett's got night skiing.
Should have gone there.

344
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,872
It's kind of like Quash Hill,
just not as lame.

345
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,877
Do you remember
the numbers I told you?

346
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,110
830.

347
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,619
Look at you, Lynch.
You got her number.

348
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,382
What did He-Man
have to say about that?

349
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,720
That guy? Who cares?
Steroids shrink your dick.

350
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,248
Oh shit, what are my numbers?

351
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,386
7860.

352
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,057
Parker, will you
remember that, 7860?

353
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,498
Nope.

354
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,662
- Early night, huh?
- Yeah.

355
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,333
Pendergraph wants to see you
in his office.

356
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,274
Something about the schedule
next weekend.

357
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,073
- I'm not working next weekend.
- Well, that's what you thought.

358
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,410
come on, Rifkin,
it's my brother's bachelor party.

359
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,143
I put in for it two months ago.

360
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,777
Go talk to the boss.
He's packing up.

361
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,253
I'm the best man.

362
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,920
Ready to shut down?

363
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,415
There's three more on the way down.
Wait for them and it's all set.

364
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,100
I am not waiting till we get back
to campus to eat.

365
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,692
I am starving.

366
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,034
Why didn't you just eat
some of that pizza?

367
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,801
Oh, you mean the cardboard
with tomato sauce you guys ate?

368
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,968
That's not pizza.

369
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,138
That's like roller-skating-rink-
birthday-party pizza. No.

370
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,945
There's a Papa Gino's in the way back.
It's like 15 minutes down the mountain.

371
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,678
Sweet.

372
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,949
I may eat a whole real pizza
myself, thank you.

373
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,957
Dan:
Whoa, look at those guys.

374
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,118
We are definitely hitting
that jump this time.

375
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,390
Last run, got to make it count.

376
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,827
Hey, Sullivan, hey.

377
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,632
Hey, man, do me a solid.
I've got to take a piss so bad I can taste it.

378
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,333
- What? What?
- I'll just be gone for two minutes.

379
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,977
Asshole.

380
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,075
- Jesus.
- It's just the wind, Parker.

381
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,021
Don't you mean baby?

382
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,502
Man on radio:
Last chair is through.

383
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,513
All set down here.

384
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,606
Man on radio:
Let's go home.

385
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,523
Oh, come on.

386
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,971
It's freakin' cold up here!

387
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,439
We don't have time for this.
Thank you.

388
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,286
Anyone know any good jokes?

389
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,551
Uh...

390
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,390
what did the 14-year-old girl
from New Hampshire

391
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,258
say to her dad
when she lost her virginity?

392
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,820
Get off me,
you're crushing my Marlboros.

393
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,129
Yup.

394
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,076
What do you think the worst
way to die would be?

395
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,582
Parker:
That's not morbid.

396
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,745
Yeah, seriously,
that's kind of spooky, Dan.

397
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,120
See, I think being eaten by a shark,

398
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,421
that would be the worst way to go.

399
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,917
Not like one of those surfers
who gets attacked from below.

400
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,260
You know, never sees it coming.

401
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,597
Like the poster for "Jaws. "

402
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,193
The chick on the "Jaws"
poster was hot.

403
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,828
She was?

404
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:03,102
I don't know. She was naked
and naked chicks are hot.

405
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:07,635
What if you actually saw
the fin coming towards you?

406
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,373
That'd be worse than being eaten,
I think.

407
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,317
I mean, knowing this giant animal
is coming at you

408
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,014
and it's gonna eat you alive.

409
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,892
Did you ever see the video,
by the way,

410
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,624
of that great white that's jumping out
of the water and eating the seal?

411
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,064
Yeah, that's why I only swim in pools.

412
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,231
I think burning would be
the worst way to go.

413
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,636
Well, yes and no.

414
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,540
I mean, most people die of smoke
inhalation before fire even touches them.

415
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,840
It's a fact.

416
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:43,211
I remember watching TV
for three days straight

417
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,478
after 9/11.

418
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:49,146
The footage they showed of those
people leaping off the Trade center.

419
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,820
can you imagine how bad
it must have been inside

420
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,692
to know that jumping would have
been the better way out?

421
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,926
Yeah, but they say that when you jump
from that height your heart stops.

422
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,663
You don't feel it
when you hit the ground.

423
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,228
Okay then, Lynch,
what is the worst way to die?

424
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,103
- What?
- Oh no no no.

425
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,042
You have an answer for everything.
What is your biggest fear?

426
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,911
That's easy.
The sarlacc pit.

427
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,480
I'm sorry, the what?

428
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,510
The sarlacc pit
from "Return of the Jedi. "

429
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,251
Uh, hello. Being slowly digested
over 1000 years...

430
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,124
worst death ever.

431
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,391
"Dan, why don't I ever
have a girlfriend?

432
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,795
Why?"

433
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,392
Hey, shut up.

434
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,704
Why hasn't the chair started again?

435
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,040
Just give it a minute.

436
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,136
This is nothing, man.

437
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,545
At Stowe last year,
me and Sullet

438
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,415
were stranded for like 25 minutes.

439
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:57,080
This big chick fell at the top
and twisted her leg, you know?

440
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,057
And I was like, fine, people.
Just hoist her off to the side.

441
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,924
Keep the line moving.
But no, they had to stop,

442
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,225
celebrate it right there.
We all had to stay on the lift

443
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,231
and freeze our asses off.

444
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,325
Honestly, by the end of it I couldn't
feel my fingers.

445
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,063
Dan:
What? come on.

446
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,733
Lynch:
Oh, come on now.

447
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,766
Man, this is so messed up.

448
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,080
- Are you kidding me?
- Dan.

449
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:26,174
I kind of just shat my pants a little bit.
I'm not gonna lie.

450
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,585
Hey!

451
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,749
Turn the goddamn lights on!

452
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,757
They forgot that we're up here.
No one knows we're up here.

453
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,594
They didn't forget
that we're up here, okay?

454
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,691
There's cameras all over the place.

455
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,134
- Hello!
- Hey!

456
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,435
Assholes, start the chair!
We're freezing!

457
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,337
Oh my God.
What if they can't get the chair moving?

458
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,436
What if... what if everyone went home?

459
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,947
Hey hey, you know what you need to do?
You need to stop, okay?

460
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,041
You're just scaring the shit out of me.

461
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:03,020
By the way, remind me to knock
the shit out of that chairlift guy.

462
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,783
What exactly did you say to him?

463
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,053
What? Nothing.
I didn't say anything to him.

464
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,788
Well, you clearly pissed him off
enough to do this.

465
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,125
Look, he knows we're up here.

466
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,653
Then why are the lights off, Dan?

467
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,029
Is that part of their policy?

468
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,795
Turn off the lights
and scare the customers?

469
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,826
I don't know.

470
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,304
Maybe it's a power outage
or something, okay?

471
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,330
That stuff happens all the time.

472
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,367
They didn't go home.
That's retarded.

473
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,081
This is so messed up.

474
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,516
I mean, worst-case scenario

475
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,684
they send up a ladder
or something, right?

476
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,502
Worst case I could just jump.

477
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,832
I've done that before.

478
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,341
It's not so bad.

479
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,676
We have to get off these chairs.
We can't stay up in this chair.

480
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,744
Why isn't the goddamn chair
moving, Dan?

481
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,246
You acting all psycho is not gonna
make the chair move along, okay?

482
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,520
All right?

483
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,424
Please don't yell at me.

484
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,298
I didn't mean to yell.

485
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,369
This shit happens
all the time though, okay?

486
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,934
I mean, they can't just leave
people up on chairs.

487
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,707
You know the kind of lawsuit
that they would have?

488
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,715
What other people?

489
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,312
There wasn't anybody
in front of us.

490
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,283
They're not gonna leave us
up here all night.

491
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,723
That's all I'm saying.

492
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,226
It's Sunday.

493
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,626
It's fucking Sunday

494
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,631
and they're not open again till Friday.

495
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,463
We're gonna be stuck
here all week.

496
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,731
Oh God.

497
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,432
We're not gonna
be stuck up here.

498
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,907
Parker.
Parker, look at me.

499
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,002
come on, there is no way a ski resort
would let that happen,

500
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,411
no matter how shitty
they are, okay?

501
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,190
Hello!

502
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,261
Somebody help us, please!

503
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,501
- Somebody! Hello!
- Hey hey hey.

504
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,600
- come on, it's all right.
- Somebody!

505
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,338
Shh.
come on, it's okay.

506
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,346
They're gonna turn
the power on in a minute.

507
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,043
We're all gonna be
laughing about this. Seriously.

508
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,855
I have to pee.

509
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,483
I have to pee wicked bad.

510
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,462
Yeah, that makes two of us.

511
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,464
Ew, Lynch.

512
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,160
If you pull your junk out
in front of me, I might puke.

513
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,998
Well, what do you want me to do?
I've got to go.

514
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,138
How am I supposed to go?

515
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,870
I don't know. Just, you know,
lift this up and bend down.

516
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,572
Are you crazy?
Put the bar down.

517
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,876
It's just a safety bar, okay?
It doesn't really do anything.

518
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:21,249
Well, I like the safety bar and I like it
down where it's supposed to be.

519
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,719
Well, how are you gonna piss?

520
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:28,555
- I can hold it.
- For a week?

521
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,430
What? She's the one saying
we're gonna be here for a week.

522
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,172
I can hold it.

523
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,841
Well, I can't.
I'm pissing.

524
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:48,004
Ew, that is so gross, Lynch.

525
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,344
Well, too bad, okay?

526
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,684
Make me wait up here

527
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,016
in this below freezing weather...

528
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,686
while I wait for this Fisher-Price
lift to work.

529
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,522
Ah.

530
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,960
Oh shit.

531
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,228
Hey!
We're up here!

532
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,287
Hello!

533
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,662
- Somebody help us!
- Somebody!

534
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,564
- Put the bar down, Joe.
- Help!

535
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,092
Put the goddamn bar down, Joe!

536
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,964
Parker:
God, it feels like a needle.

537
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,937
Hey!
Hey!

538
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,608
What did I tell you guys?

539
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,174
Parker:
Hello!

540
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,187
- Hey!
- Hey, we're over here!

541
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,689
Whoo-hoo!

542
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,291
Up here!

543
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,458
- Whoo-hoo!
- Help us!

544
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,195
Help us!

545
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,998
Man on radio:
cody, this is base.

546
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,467
Parker:
Why is he stopping?

547
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,205
He's gonna help us.
He sees us.

548
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,507
Go for cody.

549
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,811
Hey man, where you at?

550
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,315
I'm cutting over to Pinewood
to pick up Barnes.

551
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,322
No, man, Barnes just landed.
The mountain is clear.

552
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,722
come back to base so we can
get the hell out of here.

553
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,717
copy that.

554
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:21,922
Parker:
Hey, where are you going?

555
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,526
- Hey! Hey!
- Where's he going?

556
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,234
- What is he doing?
- Where is he going?

557
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,004
- Up here!
- We're up here!

558
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,713
- Hey!
- come on.

559
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,617
Up here.

560
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,057
Hey!

561
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:53,590
- Hey!
- Please don't leave us!

562
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,930
- Look up!
- No!

563
00:33:56,968 --> 00:34:00,267
- come back! Stop!
- Hey!

564
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,967
Stop! Stop!

565
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,072
Hey, come back!

566
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,619
Parker:
come back. We're here.

567
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:21,216
No. No.

568
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,177
Parker:
My face is burning.

569
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,682
Dan:
Power's coming back on.

570
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,583
- No it isn't.
- It has to.

571
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,588
Parker:
Does anybody know what time it is?

572
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:55,023
Hold on. Let me just
run back to the locker.

573
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,152
I'll check my phone real quick.

574
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,994
Okay,

575
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,263
top three breakfast cereals
of all time.

576
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,327
Go.

577
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,099
Okay, I'll go first.

578
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,664
Uh, crunch Berries.

579
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,438
- Stop.
- cinnamon Toast crunch.

580
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,105
Please stop.

581
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,977
And I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

582
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,448
Lucky charms
pre purple horseshoes.

583
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,351
Is it just me or is it really weird

584
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,786
eating purple horseshoes?

585
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,554
Everybody went home.

586
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,291
They left us up here.

587
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,661
Top three celebrities you'd do.
Go.

588
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,534
Somebody needs to jump.

589
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,674
If we're up here all week
we're gonna die.

590
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,714
Hey. Shh.

591
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,188
Hey.

592
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,487
Shh shh.

593
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,324
- It's okay.
- I don't want to die up here, Dan.

594
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,331
No no no.
Hey, you're not gonna die.

595
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:11,096
I promise I won't let you die.

596
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,933
Okay?

597
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,065
I'm so...

598
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,738
I'm so scared.

599
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,612
Dan:
Yeah, me too.

600
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,680
Oh my God.

601
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,554
Hey, guys.

602
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,362
What was the best christmas
present you guys ever got?

603
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,695
Shaina my puppy.

604
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,362
Hey, Dan?

605
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,372
No? Okay.

606
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,567
I guess it's my turn.

607
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,704
My skis.
You get it?

608
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,810
- Oh shit.
- Oh! Shit.

609
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,716
Hey. Hey.

610
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,657
Look at me.
Look at me.

611
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,786
Look at me. Look at me.

612
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,058
Your face is...

613
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:16,294
it's really red.
I think you got frostbite.

614
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,428
Lynch:
No, you can't get frostbite that fast.

615
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,665
We've only been up here, what?

616
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,937
I mean, it's only been
a few hours tops.

617
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,069
- What are you doing?
- I'm jumping.

618
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,908
- No you're not.
- Yes I am.

619
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,244
Even if I hurt myself
I can get myself down

620
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,682
and I can get us some help.

621
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:34,946
It's too far, man.
You can't jump.

622
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,954
- Do you have a better idea?
- Than jumping?

623
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,580
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got a better idea.

624
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,853
We can wait till the morning.
I mean, someone's gonna come.

625
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,256
A groomer or some shit.

626
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,284
They're gonna groom the mountain
when it's closed, huh?

627
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,592
When it's not gonna be open
for another five days.

628
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,156
- Dan, don't leave me.
- I can do this.

629
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,770
All right, Joe's gonna
be here with you, okay?

630
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,466
All right?
He'll take care of you.

631
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,134
No, man, don't do this.
Walker, don't.

632
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,338
Dan, don't leave me.
Please.

633
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,711
Look at me.
Look at me.

634
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:09,943
You're gonna be okay, baby.
You're gonna be okay.

635
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,023
- Dan, no.
- Don't do this, man.

636
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,362
Remember that thing I said
about having done this before?

637
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,344
I totally lied.
I'm scared shitless.

638
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,700
Dan! Danny!

639
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,266
Dan, are you okay? Say something!

640
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,108
Oh my God.

641
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,547
Oh my God!

642
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,346
Danny!
Talk to me, Danny!

643
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,910
Oh my God.

644
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,252
- Oh my God, my legs.
- Dan!

645
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,556
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

646
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,858
My legs are broken!
Oh my God!

647
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,057
can you move, Dan?

648
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,431
No, I can't.
I can't move.

649
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,231
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, baby.

650
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,362
- What are you doing?
- I've got to get down to him.

651
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,872
Stop, you're gonna get hurt.
calm down.

652
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,136
No no no, stay there.

653
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,575
Don't get off the chair.
Stay on the chair.

654
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:44,103
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

655
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,809
It's really bad.

656
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,286
The bone is sticking out of my leg.
Help!

657
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,447
Help!

658
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,480
Please help!

659
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,389
Hey, Dan, buddy.

660
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,984
Dan, can you move at all?

661
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,495
No, man, it's bad.

662
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,725
You can't slide down the hill
or anything?

663
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:05,065
No, I can't slide down the fucking hill!
I'm bleeding to death, man!

664
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,002
Okay okay.

665
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,971
can you stop the bleeding?

666
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,941
- With what?
- Hold on.

667
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,480
Here.

668
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,951
Shit!

669
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,510
Hey, Dan, hold on, man.

670
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,250
Hold on.
I'm gonna throw mine down to you.

671
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,418
Here it comes.
Ready?

672
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,586
can you get to it?

673
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,599
Just feel for it, buddy.

674
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,961
I got it.
I got it.

675
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:17,804
Okay, Dan, you're gonna have to
tie that to your legs.

676
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,037
Tie it onto your legs
above where it's bleeding.

677
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,807
Okay?
Like a tourniquet thing.

678
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:35,590
Okay, hold on. Wait.
Here, take my coat.

679
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:39,221
No, leave your coat on.
Don't take your coat off.

680
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,163
It's okay.
I can huddle next to Lynch.

681
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,063
- Please.
- Leave your coat on!

682
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,507
Fuck!

683
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,918
- Hey. Hey, Dan.
- What?

684
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,220
Maybe I can climb up to the cable

685
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,523
and get to a chair
that's closer to the ground.

686
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,553
You've got to be careful, man.
Those cables are razor sharp.

687
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:16,122
You think you can pull yourself
across on these chairs?

688
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,562
I can't even do a pull-up.

689
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,433
You never even tried
to do a fucking pull-up.

690
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:24,202
Your mom had to write you a letter
so you could get out of gym class.

691
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,304
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah?

692
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,973
Remember Jenny Bluth?
Huh?

693
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,540
Remember her?
She could do a fucking pull-up.

694
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,279
I know, but...

695
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,777
even if I get to that chair,
how many more chairs is it gonna take

696
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,255
before I get to one
that's closer to the ground?

697
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,886
The poles.

698
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,828
The poles, they all have
ladders on them, okay?

699
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,228
The lift poles.

700
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,993
You just have to find
your way to one of those.

701
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,001
Okay.

702
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:54,766
Okay, how far is that chair
away from the pole?

703
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,603
- I don't know.
- Just give me a second.

704
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,075
Give me a second, all right?

705
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,510
Wait, what if you fall too?

706
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:06,004
Parker, if we stay up here we're gonna
freeze to death and he's gonna die.

707
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,288
Okay, Dan.
Dan, I'm gonna try and scale back

708
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,415
to the next chair.

709
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,757
Baby.

710
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,025
Baby, was that you?

711
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:23,591
- What?
- Hey, shut up, Dan. Shut up.

712
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,801
Oh my God.

713
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,864
Oh my God.
That was a wolf.

714
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,274
Dan, that's not a wolf, man.
That's a coyote or something.

715
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,540
Dan:
I know the sound of a fucking wolf!

716
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,945
- Help!
- They're scared of people.

717
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,450
- Help me!
- come on, relax.

718
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,884
When was the last time you heard
of a wolf attack in New England?

719
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,014
Never.
They're pussies, man.

720
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,490
The wolves around here,
they're not even that big.

721
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:54,728
Hey. Hey, listen.
It could be worse, right?

722
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,232
How could it be worse?

723
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,296
It could be the sarlacc pit.

724
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:05,069
Hey, Parker came through
with the tension breaker, bud.

725
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,475
Your girl's all right, Walker.

726
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,480
- Hey, she's all right.
- Just climb.

727
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,982
Please, please just climb.

728
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:16,248
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, I'm coming.

729
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,154
Hold on.

730
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,820
It'll be okay, Dan.

731
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:31,063
You know it's funny, I was never
afraid of heights until right now.

732
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,399
- Okay, what can I do to help?
- I don't know.

733
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,405
Just hold on to my legs.

734
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,930
I mean, you can't stop me
from falling but it's...

735
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,943
it's like psychological or something.

736
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,502
- Okay.
- Okay.

737
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,441
Oh shit, it's high.
It's really fucking high.

738
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,680
- What can I do to help?
- Nothing. Just stop talking, okay?

739
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,688
- Okay.
- Okay.

740
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,213
come on.

741
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,095
Dan:
Please hurry!

742
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,362
Dan, just be quiet, okay?

743
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,800
Oh God.

744
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,766
Shit, it's all ice.

745
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:17,212
Hey, Dan.
Dan, buddy, it's all ice.

746
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:20,148
But I think if we knock it off
I can get to the top.

747
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,416
Hold on.

748
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,381
Shit.

749
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,708
Oh shit.

750
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,941
What am I supposed to do?

751
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:56,285
You guys!

752
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,185
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

753
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,023
Get the hell away from him!

754
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,537
Hey.
Hey, are you all right?

755
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,664
Yeah.

756
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,800
Yeah, I'm alive.

757
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,311
See, I told you, man.

758
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,611
They're more afraid of you
than you are of them. Huh?

759
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,550
I don't know, man.
I'm pretty afraid.

760
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,382
I know, man.
I know.

761
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,014
I can't feel my legs anymore.

762
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,355
That's not good, right?

763
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:39,453
I mean, they don't hurt as bad,

764
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,623
but that's not good.

765
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:44,065
No no, it's fine.
You're gonna be all right.

766
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,501
Okay, it's probably
really really bad.

767
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,471
We're got to move and get...

768
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,030
Hey hey hey.
Go like this.

769
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,565
Ow.
Ow, it's like a sunburn.

770
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,010
- No no, I think it's frostbite.
- What?

771
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,809
Is my face changing color anywhere?

772
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,383
I don't know.
I can't see anything.

773
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,318
Don't... don't touch it.
Stop.

774
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,321
- Stop.
- But it itches now.

775
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,220
I know, but if you rub your face
it's gonna come off.

776
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:08,519
Will you just hurry up up there?!

777
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,823
Okay, I'm trying.
Hold on.

778
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,692
Shit.

779
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:29,709
Be careful.

780
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,613
Okay, just don't talk.

781
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,217
I can do this.

782
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,128
Oh, I got you.

783
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,687
Shit, it's slippery.

784
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,093
Parker:
Don't look down.

785
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,367
My boots are so heavy.

786
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,417
The cable is cutting
through my gloves.

787
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,723
Do you got it?

788
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,907
Oh, my hands.

789
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,505
Oh my God.

790
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:40,675
What?
What's wrong?

791
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,151
Oh my God.
Okay.

792
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,316
Parker:
What is it? What?

793
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,783
I got you.
I got you, you're okay.

794
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,818
I got you.

795
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,354
You're okay.

796
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,094
What's wrong?

797
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,601
- What's wrong?
- Don't look down.

798
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,728
- What?
- Don't look. Don't look.

799
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,262
- Lynch.
- Yeah, man?

800
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,935
Don't you let her look.

801
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,444
- Don't you fucking let her look.
- Dan!

802
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,878
- Shh.
- Dan!

803
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,212
No, I won't, man.

804
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,115
Don't.

805
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,882
Don't you let her look!

806
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:21,152
Dan!

807
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,561
Let me look.
I need to look.

808
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:31,123
I need to look!

809
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,295
No!

810
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,970
No! Dan!

811
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,533
Let me look!

812
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,912
- No!
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

813
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:51,148
Oh my God.

814
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,848
Oh God.
Think about Dan.

815
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:03,495
Shh shh.

816
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,093
Don't listen to it.
Just don't listen to it.

817
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,229
Don't listen to it.

818
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,837
Okay. Okay.

819
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,679
Okay.

820
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,766
Dan!

821
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,879
No, Dan.

822
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,283
No!

823
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,475
cables cut through my gloves.

824
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,678
My hands are wasted.

825
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,484
Why'd you let him jump?

826
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,127
You can't be serious.

827
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,620
It was too far.

828
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,692
No, he said he could do it.

829
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:48,101
You didn't try to stop him.

830
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,974
I can't believe this.
Are you trying to blame me?

831
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,946
No.

832
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,539
No, I'm not blaming you.

833
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,050
I mean, you're his girlfriend.

834
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,484
I didn't see you trying to throw
yourself in front of him.

835
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,852
He wasn't going to listen to me.

836
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,618
But he would have listened to me?

837
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,720
No, I said it was a bad idea.

838
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,490
I said it was too far a drop.

839
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,964
I didn't hear any ideas from you
except for crying about it.

840
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,126
Don't you fucking blame me.

841
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,999
You've been his girlfriend for what,
a year?

842
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,872
Maybe?

843
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:33,640
I've known him
my entire fucking life.

844
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,546
You should've...

845
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,713
- you should've...
- What?

846
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,982
Say it!

847
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,086
It should've been me.

848
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,530
- No.
- That's what you want to say.

849
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,830
No, that's...
that's not what I said.

850
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,701
It's okay. I get it.
I get it.

851
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,729
It should have been me
down there, right?

852
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,172
'cause who gives a fuck about me?

853
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,199
No.

854
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,103
You know what?

855
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,546
If we hadn't spent the entire day
on the fucking bunny hill

856
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,516
watching you fall on your ass

857
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,519
we would have done some runs
and we could have gone home.

858
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,680
I'm sorry.

859
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,257
Or maybe if you hadn't
fucked with our thing.

860
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,523
Maybe if you had just stayed home

861
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,689
and not tried to force yourself

862
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,789
into every little aspect of his life

863
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,925
my best friend
wouldn't be dead right now.

864
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,368
That's...

865
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,201
not fair.

866
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,139
That's not fair.

867
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:36,574
It's not fair
that my best friend is dead.

868
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,915
He's not coming back.
He's gone.

869
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:48,049
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

870
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,077
I'm sorry.

871
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,485
I'm sorry.

872
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,511
I'm so sorry, Lynch.

873
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,948
Please.

874
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,126
I'm sorry.

875
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,698
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

876
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:47,306
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, okay?

877
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,784
I didn't mean it.

878
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,500
830.

879
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,806
Lynch:
Oh shit.

880
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,331
What were my numbers?

881
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,504
- 786...
- 7860.

882
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:20,479
830-7860.

883
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:22,508
Yeah.

884
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,248
I'm so gonna call that girl
when I get back.

885
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,552
You know what?

886
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,354
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
No messing around.

887
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,520
I'm just gonna call her and I'm gonna
be like, "Hey, Shannon.

888
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,258
It's Joe from the chairlift.
Will you marry me?"

889
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,425
We'll get a house,
have two kids

890
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,162
and a dog named Steve.

891
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:42,399
- Who's gonna pay for the house?
- She will.

892
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,566
She's got a great job.

893
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,507
Parker:
What does she do?

894
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:49,103
Lynch:
Orthodontist.

895
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,545
Parker:
Orthodontists make a lot of money.

896
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,412
Yeah.

897
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:57,011
Well, I'm sure the two of you
will be really happy.

898
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,619
Lynch:
830-7860.

899
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,421
Who names their dog Steve?

900
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,726
I will.

901
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,193
Steve's a people name.

902
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:13,464
Says who?

903
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,299
You don't, like,
go to someone's house

904
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:21,970
and have them say,
"Here, meet my dog Steve. "

905
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,572
Why not?
I think Steve's a good name for a dog.

906
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,947
Here, meet my cat chris.

907
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,714
No cat.

908
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:33,814
Just a dog...
Steve.

909
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,718
Shaina must be so hungry.

910
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,824
What kind of pizza should we get?

911
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,426
The poor thing.

912
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:51,102
She's just a puppy.

913
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:56,172
She's not gonna understand
that I died.

914
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,806
She's gonna think that I left,

915
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,818
that I forgot about her.

916
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,581
She's probably waiting

917
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,023
by the front door right now.

918
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,789
At every little noise
that she hears

919
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,296
in the hallway,

920
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,595
she's probably
cocking her little head

921
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,829
to the side

922
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,497
wondering when
I'm gonna come in.

923
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,133
But I won't.

924
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,473
I won't come in.

925
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,638
And she's gonna...
she's gonna starve to death.

926
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,017
She's gonna starve to death

927
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:39,647
waiting for me to come in.

928
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:41,987
It's all my fault.

929
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,823
She's not gonna starve to death.

930
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,557
You're not gonna die, Parker.

931
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:51,966
I'm the only one with a key
to my apartment, though.

932
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,526
Yeah, I know, but the neighbors
will kick the door down

933
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,472
if she doesn't stop barking.

934
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,907
Someone will figure it out.

935
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,309
She'll be just fine.

936
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,205
So will you.

937
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,809
So will we.

938
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,158
I just want to see my mom.

939
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,896
And my dad.

940
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,692
Ah!

941
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:21,070
I thought I was dreaming.

942
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,011
I thought I was dreaming this.

943
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:35,749
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

944
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,991
Your frostbite is getting worse.

945
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,624
- Really? How bad...
- Don't touch it. It's bad.

946
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,065
It doesn't itch as much anymore.

947
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,537
Okay, don't touch your face though.

948
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:53,703
When we get out of here
I'm gonna get you to a doctor.

949
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,303
- They'll fix it right away.
- You have...

950
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,973
You have red marks on your face too.

951
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,443
They'll fix me up too.

952
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,489
Don't. Don't.
Don't touch it. It's bad.

953
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:14,753
Lynch:
Well, it's the morning.

954
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,631
Maybe someone will come up now.

955
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,761
Parker:
For what?

956
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,967
Mountain maintenance.
I don't know.

957
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:29,836
Besides, if we don't show up for class
people will start looking for us.

958
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:31,904
No one knows we're here.

959
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:35,746
I didn't tell anyone
I was coming.

960
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,588
Help!

961
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:42,614
We need help!

962
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,661
If I can get to that pole
I can climb down the ladder.

963
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,508
How are you gonna climb
with your hands like that?

964
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,342
We won't make it another night.

965
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,644
Are you sure you don't want to...

966
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:09,014
wait a few hours?

967
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:11,042
I mean, maybe you're right.

968
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,954
Maybe someone's coming in today.

969
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,694
Parker:
The sun feels good.

970
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:44,263
First we're freezing,
now we're gonna get sunburned.

971
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,673
Be careful what you wish for, right?

972
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:49,303
How come you
never have a girlfriend?

973
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,439
Lynch:
How am I supposed to answer that?

974
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:55,109
Parker:
I just mean you're a decent guy.

975
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,381
And chicks dig you.

976
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,116
But you never
have a relationship.

977
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,958
Lynch:
I had a serious girlfriend once.

978
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,553
- High school doesn't count.
- No.

979
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,893
No, post high school.
Freshman year.

980
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:10,831
Who?

981
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,664
This girl Annie.

982
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:17,195
We met at freshman orientation.

983
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,833
We emailed each other
during the summer.

984
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,673
When we got back to school
it was like we were dating.

985
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,202
Oh.

986
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:27,374
I just really felt it
with her, you know?

987
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,907
We were into the same stuff,
which was cool.

988
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,182
She was way into Aerosmith.

989
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:34,382
I'd seen 'em five times.
She'd seem 'em eight.

990
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,857
What happened?

991
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,686
She, uh...

992
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:46,231
had the same favorite
movie as me... ET.

993
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,337
It was like soulmates,
that shit you read about.

994
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:57,344
So what happened?

995
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,244
Same old shit.

996
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,512
No.

997
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:05,076
You know what happened?
She...

998
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,952
she liked another guy.

999
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:13,221
This fraternity douchebag
named Dean.

1000
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,031
She dumped you for a frat guy?

1001
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,863
No.

1002
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:21,096
No, I dumped her.

1003
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,367
We were in the cafeteria, right?

1004
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,636
You know, we were having lunch,
facing each other.

1005
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:29,201
I was facing the wall and she was
facing everybody behind me.

1006
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:34,907
And I kept seeing her, like,

1007
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,748
you know, looking at somebody.
You know, like kind of laughing.

1008
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,652
And I was just like,
you know,

1009
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,588
"What's so funny?"
You know?

1010
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,819
And, you know, like,
"What the hell is going on?"

1011
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:45,383
And she said...

1012
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,832
she said,
"Dean's making fun of you. "

1013
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:55,769
So I turn around and I'm ready to
just beat the shit out of this guy.

1014
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,575
But all I can see are these
random fucking people.

1015
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,736
All these faces.

1016
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:06,578
This guy was making eyes
at my girl and could see me

1017
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:09,584
but I couldn't see him.

1018
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,286
That's messed up.

1019
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,420
I never felt so stupid.

1020
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:23,293
I just walked out.

1021
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,200
You just walked out?

1022
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,260
Yeah, I told her to laugh it up
with Dean the frat guy.

1023
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,999
I was out.

1024
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,507
That sucks.

1025
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:37,675
Maybe I shouldn't have been
so quick to walk away.

1026
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:40,614
You know, maybe I should
have had a thicker skin

1027
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,640
and not been
such a sensitive bitch.

1028
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,524
Sometimes I feel like
I was just insecure.

1029
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:54,654
Maybe I screwed up.

1030
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,861
You should tell her that.

1031
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:02,962
When you get home
you should call her.

1032
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:07,471
I can't.

1033
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,205
She's dating Dean.

1034
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,588
I should have done something.

1035
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:30,855
There was nothing
you could have done.

1036
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:34,427
I just sat here
and I let him die.

1037
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,166
No, you didn't.
We didn't let him die, okay?

1038
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:38,867
There was nothing
we could have done.

1039
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,536
He jumped down there
to save us, okay?

1040
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,009
He was the one.

1041
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,950
He was the boy
I was gonna marry.

1042
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:54,748
Hey.

1043
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,951
First grade

1044
01:09:56,992 --> 01:10:00,359
and we get left there
by our moms

1045
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:01,761
for the day.

1046
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,697
It's like the first
real day of school,

1047
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:05,359
you know,
without your folks around.

1048
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:09,303
And Dan was this chubby little kid.

1049
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,363
No, fuck it.

1050
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:14,399
He was a fat ass.

1051
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:17,037
And so our moms all leave

1052
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,206
but Dan wouldn't let go
of his mom's hand.

1053
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:23,116
And even after she left he just stood
at the front of the class

1054
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,245
crying like a total pussy.

1055
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:28,051
- That sounds like Dan.
- Yeah, you have no idea.

1056
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,093
Anyway, so the teacher...

1057
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,891
oh, what's her name?

1058
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,496
Mrs. Schifrin.

1059
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:44,233
So Mrs. Schifrin is trying everything
to get the fat kid to stop crying.

1060
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,901
And she says,

1061
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:49,240
"You know,
maybe there's somebody...

1062
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:51,405
somebody else
you know in the class.

1063
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:53,438
Maybe you have a friend
you want to sit with. "

1064
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:58,914
And this little fucker points
right at me and says, "Him. "

1065
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:01,855
Now I've never seen
this kid in my life.

1066
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:06,693
But for some reason
he pointed at me.

1067
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,495
- So you had to sit with him?
- Yeah, for a whole week.

1068
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:13,763
Whole first week of school I had to share
my little cubby with his fat ass.

1069
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,963
Oh, gosh.

1070
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,369
He was a douchebag.
I never let him forget it.

1071
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:42,219
Dan didn't die up here just for you
and I to give up and die too.

1072
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,205
Help me up.

1073
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,656
Are you okay?

1074
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:22,697
Oh God!

1075
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,501
Oh shit.

1076
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,703
- Shit, just hold on.
- Oh my God.

1077
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:30,610
- The chair is gonna fall.
- No it's not. No it's not.

1078
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,672
Oh, God.

1079
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,677
My hands.

1080
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,590
Oh God, my hands.

1081
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:36,169
Joe!

1082
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,959
Fuck you, Jenny Bluth.

1083
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,755
Oh fuck.

1084
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:06,632
Oh shit.
Shit.

1085
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,200
- Hey, Parker.
- What?

1086
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:12,111
I need you to throw my extra pole
as far as you can this way.

1087
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:14,138
What?

1088
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,777
I said I want you
to throw my ski pole

1089
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,447
as far down the hill as you can.

1090
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,854
I'm gonna need some defense
when I get on the ground.

1091
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,983
Okay.

1092
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,657
Okay.

1093
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,431
Oh my God.

1094
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:11,933
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

1095
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:15,068
It's okay.

1096
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:26,447
Shit.
Oh shit.

1097
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,081
Okay.

1098
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,683
Parker:
You can do it.

1099
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:34,355
You can do it.
Please do it.

1100
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,588
Please don't break.
Please don't break.

1101
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,304
Shit.

1102
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:31,085
I just want to go.
Please let me go.

1103
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,138
You did it!
You did it!

1104
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,489
- Oh shit.
- Joe!

1105
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,354
Lynch!

1106
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:14,027
- Lynch!
- I'm okay.

1107
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,586
No! No!

1108
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,564
No!

1109
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,747
Stay the fuck back!

1110
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:20,385
Try and stay still.

1111
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,594
I'll be back as fast as I can.

1112
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:29,035
Please please hurry.
Please.

1113
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:34,432
Joe, look out!

1114
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,943
Joe!

1115
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:02,847
Aw, Joe...

1116
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:12,019
Ow!

1117
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:16,427
Hello!

1118
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:24,201
Help, please!

1119
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:26,179
Wait!

1120
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,078
Hey, you okay?

1121
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:36,674
Hello?

1122
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:38,583
Hey, you all right?

1123
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,248
Hold on.
Hold on.

1124
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:42,688
Hold on.

1125
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:44,749
I'm gonna get you help.

1126
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:49,462
No, there were no other cars.

1127
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:53,263
I found her laying in the road
right outside of Mt. Holliston.

1128
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:58,769
I'm taking her to you now.

1129
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:02,306
Hold on.

1130
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:04,538
The hospital
is only 10 minutes away.

1131
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,845
You're gonna be okay.

1132
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:10,112
You're gonna
be okay.

1133
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:13,614
Dan's voice:
You're gonna be okay, baby.

1134
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:18,018
You're gonna be okay.
