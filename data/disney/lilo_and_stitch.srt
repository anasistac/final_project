1
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,991
Read the charges.

2
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,694
Dr. Jumba Jookiba...

3
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,999
lead scientist of
Galaxy Defense Industries...

4
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:41,596
you stand before this council

5
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:46,010
accused of illegal
genetic experimentation.

6
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,350
How do you plead?

7
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,184
Not guilty!

8
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,020
My experiments
are only theoretical...

9
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,960
completely
within legal boundaries.

10
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:06,523
We believe you actually
created something.

11
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,364
Created something?! Ha!

12
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,462
But that would be irresponsible
and unethical.

13
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,200
I would never, ever...

14
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,207
...make more than one.

15
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,148
What is that monstrosity?

16
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,382
Monstrosity!

17
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:34,758
What you see before you
is the first of a new species.

18
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:38,821
I call it Experiment 6-2-6.

19
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,858
He is bulletproof, fireproof

20
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,700
and can think faster
than supercomputer.

21
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,296
He can see in the dark

22
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,002
and move objects
3,000 times his size.

23
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,341
His only instinct:

24
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,779
To destroy
everything he touches!

25
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,279
So, it <i>is</i> a monster.

26
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,752
Hey, just a little one.

27
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,379
It is an affront to nature.

28
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,083
It must be destroyed!

29
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,058
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.

30
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,560
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.

31
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,564
Experiment 6-2-6

32
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,090
give us some sign you understand
any of this.

33
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,731
Show us that there is something
inside you that is good.

34
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,176
Hmm?

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,701
<i>Meega, nala kweesta!</i>

36
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,112
So naughty!

37
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,147
I didn't teach it that.

38
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,713
Place that idiot scientist
under arrest!

39
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:42,785
I prefer to be called
"evil genius"!

40
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,195
And as for that abomination...

41
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,798
...it is the flawed product
of a deranged mind.

42
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,368
It has no place among us.

43
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,373
Captain Gantu, take him away.

44
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,874
With pleasure.

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,587
Hmm.

46
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,131
Uncomfortable?

47
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,132
Oh...

48
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,428
Good!

49
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,801
The council has banished you
to exile on a desert asteroid.

50
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,807
So, relax... enjoy the trip

51
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,809
and don't get any ideas.

52
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:34,836
These guns are locked
onto your genetic signature.

53
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,678
They won't shoot anyone but you.

54
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,976
Ow! Why, you!

55
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,850
May I remind the captain
that he is on duty.

56
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,082
Secure the cell!

57
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,991
Aye, Captain.

58
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,863
Captain on deck.

59
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,926
All ahead full.

60
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,502
Do... Does this, uh,
look infected to you?

61
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,726
Oh!

62
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,304
Quiet, you.

63
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,506
Gunfire in the cell bay!

64
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,512
Open a channel.

65
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,988
He's loose on Deck C!

66
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,558
Red alert.
Seal off the deck!

67
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,765
Security,
converge on door seven!

68
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,033
Deadly force authorized.

69
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,869
Fire on sight!

70
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,499
There he is!

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,743
Security to Bridge.

72
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,409
It's in the ventilation system.

73
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,079
He's headed for the power...

74
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,089
...grid.

75
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,552
What was that?

76
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,119
I don't think he's
on the ship anymore.

77
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,894
Confirmed.
He's taken a police cruiser.

78
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,136
Yeah... he took the red one.

79
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,832
Yee-haw!

80
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,385
Hmm?!

81
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,824
<i>That's it!</i>

82
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,725
<i>We got it.</i>
<i>We got it!</i>

83
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,923
Hyperdrive activated.

84
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,932
System charging.

85
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,935
He's engaged his H-drive!

86
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,494
Warning...
guidance is not functional.

87
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,506
Pursuit Commander

88
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,633
that crazy trog is
about to make a jump!

89
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,201
<i>Break formation!</i>
<i>Get clear of that ship!</i>

90
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,872
Navigation failure.

91
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,381
Do not engage hyper...

92
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,119
Get me Galactic Control.

93
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,956
Where is he?!

94
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,362
He's still in hyperspace.

95
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,832
Where will he exit?

96
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,959
Calculating now...

97
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:46,198
quadrant 17, section 0-0-5,
area 51.

98
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,231
A planet called... Ee-arth.

99
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,971
I want an expert on this planet
in here now!

100
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,704
What is that?

101
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,840
Water. Most of the planet
is covered in it.

102
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,350
He won't survive in water.

103
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,375
His molecular density
is too great.

104
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,991
No...

105
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,858
Of course.

106
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,527
How much time do we have?

107
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:19,060
We have projected his landing
at three hours, 42 minutes.

108
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,595
Oh, we have to gas the planet.

109
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,039
Hold it!

110
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,166
Hold everything!

111
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,939
Earth is a protected
wildlife preserve.

112
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,673
Yeah. We've been using it

113
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,045
to rebuild
the mosquito population

114
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,677
which, need I remind you,
is an endangered species!

115
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,552
Am I to assume
you are the expert?

116
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,355
Oh, I don't know about "expert."

117
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,952
Agent Pleakley at your service.

118
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,791
Can we not simply
destroy the island?

119
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,696
No! Crazyhead!

120
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,701
The mosquito's food of choice,
primitive humanoid life forms

121
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,464
have colonies
all over that planet.

122
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,768
Are they intelligent?

123
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,398
No, but they're very delicate.

124
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,274
In fact, every time an asteroid
strikes their planet

125
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,677
they have to begin life
all over.

126
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,111
It's fascinating, isn't it?

127
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,014
With this,
I've been able to study...

128
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,383
What if our military forces
just landed there?

129
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,012
Well, that'd be a bad idea!

130
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,580
These are extremely
simple creatures, miss.

131
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,253
Landing there would create mass
mayhem and planet-wide panic!

132
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,161
A quiet capture would require
an understanding of 6-2-6

133
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,425
that we do not possess!

134
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:24,698
Who, then, Mr. Pleakley, would
you send for his extraction?

135
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,433
Does he have a brother?

136
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,442
Close grandmother, perhaps?

137
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,340
Friendly cousin?

138
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,747
Neighbor with a beard?

139
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,301
He got away?

140
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,900
I'm sure this comes
as no surprise to you.

141
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,344
I designed this creature
for to be unstoppable.

142
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,577
Which is precisely why <i>you</i>
must now bring him back.

143
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,742
What? Me?

144
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,342
And to reward you

145
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:18,449
we are willing to trade
your freedom for his capture.

146
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,661
6-2-6 will not come easily.

147
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,323
Maybe direct hit
from plasma cannon

148
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,855
might stun him long enough to...

149
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,924
Plasma cannon granted.

150
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,833
Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?

151
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,730
B-B-But it's a delicate planet!

152
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,867
Who's going to control him?

153
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,877
You will.

154
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,401
Very good, Your Highness.

155
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,538
I... I didn't quite...

156
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,874
Uh, you're not joking!

157
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:48,148
So, tell me,
my little one-eyed one

158
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:53,147
on what poor, pitiful,
defenseless planet

159
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:59,559
has my monstrosity
been unleashed?

160
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,833
Ay-yi-yi.

161
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,400
<i>He Inoa No Kalani Kalakaua</i>
<i>Kulele.</i>

162
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,432
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

163
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,371
Stop. Stop.

164
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,248
Lilo, why are you all wet?

165
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,081
It's sandwich day.

166
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,950
Every Thursday,
I take Pudge the fish

167
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,515
a peanut butter sandwich.

168
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,083
Pudge is a fish?

169
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,961
And today we were out
of peanut butter!

170
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,659
So I asked my sister
what to give him

171
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,861
and she said a tuna sandwich.

172
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,665
I can't give Pudge tuna!

173
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,605
Do you know what tuna is?

174
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,664
Fish?

175
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,335
It's fish!

176
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:01,176
If I gave Pudge tuna,
I'd be an abomination!

177
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,579
I'm late because
I had to go to the store

178
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,878
and get peanut butter

179
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,249
'cause all we have
is-is stinkin' tuna!

180
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,619
Lilo, Lilo, why is
this so important?

181
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,715
Pudge controls the weather.

182
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,884
You're crazy.

183
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,191
Please! Please!

184
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,258
Everybody calm down!

185
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,596
Girls...

186
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,470
Shh.

187
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,735
Lilo...

188
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:30,935
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

189
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,568
I won't do it again!

190
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,841
Maybe we should call
your sister.

191
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,313
No! I'll be good!

192
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,645
I want to dance.

193
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,117
I practiced.

194
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,813
I just want to dance.

195
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,790
I practiced.

196
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,816
Ooh, she bit me.

197
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,691
Eww!

198
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,764
I called your sister.

199
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,364
She said to wait for her
here on the porch.

200
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,308
We'll try again on Sunday.

201
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,311
Does this look infected
to you?

202
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,478
Yeah.

203
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,155
You better not have rabies.

204
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,315
If you have rabies

205
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,791
the dogcatcher is
going to have to cut...

206
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,851
Are you going to play dolls?

207
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,455
You don't have a doll.

208
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,795
This is Scrump.

209
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,127
I made her,
but her head is too big.

210
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,799
So I pretend a bug laid eggs
in her ears, and she's upset

211
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,502
because she only has
a few more days to...

212
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,562
Lilo!

213
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,690
Lilo?

214
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,161
Lilo?

215
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,106
Oh, no.

216
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,506
You better be home.

217
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,214
Hey! Watch where you're going!

218
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,548
Stupidhead!

219
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,960
Oh, Lilo!

220
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,190
Lilo! Open the door, Lilo!

221
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,893
Go away.

222
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,202
Lilo?

223
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,068
We don't have time for this.

224
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,907
Leave me alone to die.

225
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,307
Come on, Lilo

226
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,402
that social worker's going
to be here any minute!

227
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,497
You are so finished
when I get in there!

228
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,840
Oh, I'm going to stuff you
in the blender

229
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,604
push "puree,"
then bake you into a pie

230
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,168
and feed it
to the social worker!

231
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,941
And when he says,
"Mmm, this is great.

232
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,949
What's your secret?"
I'm going to say...

233
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,750
"Love... and nurturing."

234
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,755
Hi. Uh...

235
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,191
You must be the, uh...

236
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,625
The stupidhead.

237
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,629
Oh! Oh...

238
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,824
Oh, you know,
I'm really sorry about that

239
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,096
and if I'd known who you were,
of course I never would've...

240
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,296
Uh... I can pay for that.

241
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,634
It's a rental.

242
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,663
Are you the guardian
in question?

243
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,800
Yes. I'm Nani.

244
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,902
Nice to meet you, Mister?

245
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,674
Bubbles.

246
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:55,839
Mr. Bubbles.

247
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,143
That's a strange...

248
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,308
Yes, I know.

249
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,012
Are you going
to invite me in, Nani?

250
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,079
Uh... I thought we could
sit out here and talk.

251
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,216
I don't think so.

252
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,419
Right. Uh...

253
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,028
This way.

254
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,470
Uh... wait here.

255
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,374
Hey!

256
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,952
So...

257
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,148
lemonade?

258
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,316
Do you often
leave your sister home alone?

259
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,485
No. Never.

260
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,655
Well, except for just now.

261
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,960
Uh, I had to run
to the store to get some...

262
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,934
Oh!

263
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,870
You left the stove on
while you were out?

264
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,964
Low heat!

265
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,972
Just a simmer.

266
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:56,973
Mmm!

267
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,202
It's coming along great.

268
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,539
I found that this morning.

269
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,138
Lilo! There you are.

270
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,809
Honeyface...

271
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,444
this is Mr. Bubbles.

272
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,920
Nice to meet you.

273
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,319
Your knuckles say "Cobra."

274
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,457
Cobra Bubbles.

275
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,192
You don't look like
a social worker.

276
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,496
I'm a special classification.

277
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,298
Did you ever kill anyone?

278
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,533
We're getting off the subject.

279
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,871
Let's talk about you.

280
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,739
Are you happy?

281
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,209
I'm adjusted.

282
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,681
I eat four food groups

283
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,617
and look both ways
before crossing the street

284
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,212
and take long naps,
and get disciplined.

285
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,078
Disciplined?

286
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,184
Yeah.
She disciplines me real good.

287
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,558
Sometimes five times a day.

288
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,358
- With bricks.
- No...

289
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,522
Bricks?

290
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,156
Uh-huh, in a pillowcase.

291
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,429
Okay! That's enough sugar
for you.

292
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,301
Why don't you run along,
you little cutie.

293
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,134
The other social workers
just thought she was a scream.

294
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,164
Thirsty?

295
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,875
Let me illuminate to you
the precarious situation

296
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,440
in which you have
found yourself.

297
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:17,615
I am the one they call
when things go wrong

298
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:22,389
and things have
indeed gone wrong.

299
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,540
My friends need to be punished.

300
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,510
Call me next time
you're left here alone.

301
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,647
Yep.

302
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,658
In case you're wondering,
this did not go well.

303
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,960
You have three days
to change my mind.

304
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,501
- Blah.
- Eww!

305
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,235
Lilo!

306
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,399
Why didn't you wait
at the school?

307
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,997
You were supposed
to wait there!

308
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,371
Lilo!

309
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,674
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?

310
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,010
Answer me!

311
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,014
No!

312
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,345
No, you don't understand?

313
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,372
No!

314
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,384
No, what?

315
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,010
No!

316
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,358
You're such a pain!

317
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,957
So why don't you sell me
and buy a rabbit instead?!

318
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,265
At least a rabbit would behave
better than you!

319
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,237
Go ahead!
Then you'll be happy

320
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,672
because it'll be smarter
than me, too!

321
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,197
And quieter!

322
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,676
You'll like it,
'cause it's stinky, like you!

323
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,980
Go to your room!

324
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,981
I'm already in my room!

325
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,096
Hey.

326
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:47,538
I brought you some pizza,
in case you were hungry.

327
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,837
We're a broken family,
aren't we?

328
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,537
No.

329
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:58,004
Maybe, a little.

330
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,016
Maybe a lot.

331
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,245
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

332
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,723
We're sisters. It's our job.

333
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,418
Yeah, well, from now on...

334
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,428
I like you better as a sister
than a mom.

335
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,226
Yeah?

336
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,062
And you like me better
as a sister

337
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,397
than a rabbit, right?

338
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,733
Oh...

339
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,431
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

340
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,400
Yes.

341
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,069
Yes, I do.

342
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,743
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.

343
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,077
You hit her?

344
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,946
Before I bit her.

345
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,473
You bit her.

346
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,076
Lilo, you shouldn't...

347
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,453
People treat me different.

348
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,822
They just don't know
what to say.

349
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,258
I'll tell you what.

350
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,195
If you promise
not to fight anymore

351
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,099
I promise not to yell at you,
except on special occasions.

352
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,127
Tuesdays and bank
holidays would be good.

353
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,468
Yeah? Would that be good?

354
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,810
Oh! My camera's full again.

355
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,506
Aren't they beautiful?

356
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,455
A falling star!

357
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,321
I call it! Get out! Get out!

358
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,957
I have to make a wish!

359
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,501
Can't you go any faster?

360
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,232
Oh, no!
Gravity is increasing on me.

361
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,466
No, it's not!

362
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,474
It is, too, Lilo.

363
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,135
The same thing
happened yesterday.

364
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:35,112
You rotten sister!
Your butt is crushing me!

365
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,978
Why do you act so weird?!

366
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,817
It's me again.

367
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:46,483
I need someone
to be my friend...

368
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,619
someone who won't run away.

369
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,494
Maybe send me an angel...

370
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,659
the nicest angel you have.

371
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,239
What we when hit?

372
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,949
There it is.

373
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,749
It stay jammed under the fender.

374
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,921
We better call somebody.

375
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,944
We're looking for something
that can defend itself...

376
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,947
something that won't die...

377
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,674
something sturdy, you know?

378
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,910
Like a lobster.

379
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,247
Lilo, you lolo.

380
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,877
Do we have a lobster door?

381
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,353
No. We have a dog door.

382
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,719
We are getting a dog.

383
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,793
So nice
to see your pretty face again!

384
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,129
Jumba?

385
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,760
We need your name and address
at the bottom of the form...

386
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,298
The kennel's back this way.

387
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,104
Go. Pick someone out.

388
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,037
Hello?

389
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,346
Hello?!

390
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,144
Are there any "aminals" in here?

391
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,954
Hello!

392
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,108
Hi.

393
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,110
Hoh... ha...

394
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,078
Hi...

395
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,846
Wow!

396
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:24,940
Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.

397
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,780
All of our dogs are adoptable.

398
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,649
Except that one!

399
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,621
What is that thing?!

400
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:31,952
A dog, I think.

401
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,514
But it was dead this morning.

402
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,957
It was dead this morning?!

403
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,961
Well, we thought it was dead.
It was hit by a truck.

404
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,464
I like him!
Come here, boy.

405
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,395
Oh! Aah!

406
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,535
Wouldn't you like
a different dog?

407
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,836
We have better dogs, dear.

408
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,501
Not better than him.

409
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,477
He can talk! Say hello.

410
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,808
He... Hel...

411
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,871
Dogs can't talk, dear.

412
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:57,973
He did.

413
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,813
Does it have to be <i>this</i> dog?

414
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,151
Yes, he's good.

415
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,419
I can tell.

416
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,427
You'll have to think of a name
for him.

417
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,589
His name is... Stitch.

418
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,155
Now, that's not a real name...

419
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,325
Hmm. Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh.

420
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,666
...in Iceland...
but here, it's a good name.

421
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,193
Stitch it is.

422
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,933
And there's
a two dollar license fee.

423
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,234
I want to buy him!

424
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,970
Can I borrow two dollars?

425
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,517
He's all yours.

426
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,212
You're all mine.

427
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,619
Well, what's he doing?

428
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,146
Shh! Keep quiet.

429
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,782
He's listening for us.

430
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,218
How good is his hearing?

431
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,560
I mean, can he...

432
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,298
Why don't you run?

433
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,309
Coming! I'm coming!

434
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,675
Stop!

435
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,839
I have just determined
this situation

436
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,314
to be far too hazardous!

437
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,510
Don't worry,
I won't hit her.

438
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:10,487
No! That girl is a part
of the mosquito food chain.

439
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,787
Here! Educate yourself.

440
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,191
Using a little girl
for a shield.

441
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,195
This is low, even for you!

442
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,322
Whoo-hoo!

443
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,354
Bah!

444
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,266
Tear him apart
with all both my bare hands!

445
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,360
Have you lost your mind?!

446
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,802
What is it, Stitch?

447
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,102
We cannot be seen!

448
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,243
Bad dog, barking at nothing!

449
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,274
You can't shoot,
and you can't be seen.

450
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,407
Look at you!

451
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,078
You look like a monster.

452
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,484
We have to blend in.

453
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,121
Okay, I got to get to work.

454
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,647
Stick around town and stay
out of the roads, okay?

455
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:48,852
I'll meet you at 1:00.

456
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,690
Hmm?

457
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,696
Oh!

458
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,697
Ah!

459
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,828
Okay, I guess
we should be going.

460
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,565
What about Stitch?

461
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,376
My friends!

462
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,422
What do you want?

463
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,821
I'm sorry I bit you

464
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,325
and pulled your hair

465
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,418
and punched you in the face.

466
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,894
Apology not accepted.

467
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,921
Now get out of my way
before I run you over.

468
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,860
I got a new dog.
His name is Stitch.

469
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:35,566
That is the ugliest thing
I have ever saw.

470
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,802
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

471
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,241
Eww! Get it away from me!

472
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,642
I'm gonna get a disease!

473
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,547
Somebody do something!

474
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:48,950
Oh, great! He's loose.

475
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,751
His destructive programming
is taking effect.

476
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,554
He will be irresistibly
drawn to large cities

477
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,355
where he will back up sewers

478
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,659
reverse street signs and
steal everyone's left shoe.

479
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,144
It's nice to live on an island
with no large cities.

480
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,753
Are you okay?

481
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,239
Uh-uh.

482
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,888
Hey, over here,
little buddy.

483
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:42,255
When you're ready to give up
just let us know, heh?

484
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,267
Whee!

485
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:49,997
Yeah!

486
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,432
This is you.

487
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,966
This is your badness level.

488
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,742
It's unusually high
for someone your size.

489
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,545
We have to fix that.

490
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,948
Ay-yi-yi, Lilo!

491
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,919
Your dog cannot sit
at the table.

492
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,117
Stitch is troubled.
He needs desserts.

493
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,352
Oh, you didn't even eat
your sweet potato.

494
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,723
I thought you liked them.

495
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,988
Desserts!

496
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,267
David!

497
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,132
I got a new dog.

498
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,104
Oh! You sure it's a dog?

499
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,537
Uh-huh.

500
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,940
He used to be a collie
before he got ran over.

501
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,672
Yum!

502
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,814
Hey...

503
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,645
Blah!

504
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:11,852
Eww!

505
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,618
Howzit, Nani?

506
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,923
Did you catch fire again?

507
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,394
Nah, just the stage.

508
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,090
Listen, I was wondering

509
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,725
if you're not
doing anything this...

510
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,861
David, I told you, I can't. I...

511
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,573
I got a lot to deal with
right now.

512
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,508
I know. I just figured
you might need some time...

513
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,170
You smell like a lawn mower.

514
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,974
Look, I got to go.

515
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,107
The kid at table three's
throwing poi again.

516
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,142
Maybe some other time, okay?

517
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,483
Don't worry.

518
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,183
She likes your butt
and fancy hair.

519
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,192
I know. I read her diary.

520
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,853
She thinks it's fancy?

521
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,294
Blech!

522
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,867
Oh! Mmm!

523
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,842
Aha! Look what I find!

524
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,469
Get restraints!

525
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,911
Right.

526
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,210
Ow! Take that! Hurry!

527
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,843
Uh, hold still just a...

528
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,887
Aah!

529
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,859
Hey, Nani!

530
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,199
Is that your dog?

531
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,362
Uh...

532
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,565
All is well.

533
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,506
Please, go about your business.
I'm okay.

534
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,375
Oh, your head looks swollen.

535
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,379
Actually, she’s just ugly.

536
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,643
Darling...

537
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,979
He’s joking.

538
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,540
Ugly... look at me...

539
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,610
Uh, this is not working out.

540
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,087
Uh, b-but...

541
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,248
Mm-mm.

542
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,520
Yeah?

543
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,084
Well, who wants to work
at this stupid...

544
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,255
fakey luau anyway.

545
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,322
Come on, Lilo.

546
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,205
Did you lose your job
because of Stitch and me?

547
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,435
Nah. The manager's a vampire

548
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,037
and he wanted me to join
his legion of the undead.

549
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,480
I knew it.

550
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,040
This is a great home.

551
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,642
You'll like it a lot.

552
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,952
See?

553
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,784
Uh, Lilo...

554
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:26,790
Comfy.

555
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,490
- Hey!
- Hey!

556
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,188
What is the matter with you?

557
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,094
Be careful of the little angel!

558
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,564
It's not an angel, Lilo.

559
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,362
I don't even think it's a dog.

560
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,197
We just have to take him back.

561
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,727
He’s just cranky
because it's his bedtime.

562
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,170
He's creepy, Lilo.

563
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,834
I won't sleep
while he's loose in the house.

564
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,470
You're loose in the house
all the time

565
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,843
and I sleep just fine!

566
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,347
Hey, what are you doing?

567
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,246
Stop that, Stitch!

568
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,841
Hey!

569
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,511
Look at him, Lilo.

570
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,989
He's obviously mutated
from something else.

571
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,524
We have to take him back.

572
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,618
He was an orphan
and we adopted him!

573
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,652
What about "O'hana"?

574
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,527
He hasn't been here that long.

575
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:11,695
Neither have I.
Dad said O'hana means family.

576
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,570
Huh?

577
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,301
O'hana means family.

578
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,638
Family means...

579
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,644
...nobody gets left behind.

580
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,940
Or?

581
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,344
Or forgotten.

582
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,678
I know. I know.

583
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,775
I hate it
when you use O'hana against me.

584
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,517
Mmm.

585
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,949
Don't worry, you can sleep
right next to me.

586
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,527
Look how curious the puppy is.

587
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,332
This is my room,
and this is your bed.

588
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,366
This is your dolly and bottle.

589
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,069
See? Doesn't spill.

590
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,202
I filled it with coffee.

591
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,770
Good puppy. Now get into bed.

592
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,449
Hey!

593
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,815
That's mine!

594
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,053
Down!

595
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,081
Mmm!

596
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,524
Be careful of that!

597
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,152
You don't touch this!

598
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,254
Don't ever touch it!

599
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,936
No! Don't pull on her head!

600
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,200
She's recovering from surgery.

601
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,273
No! That's from my blue period.

602
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,811
Mmm...

603
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,114
There.

604
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,849
You know, you wreck
everything you touch.

605
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,824
Why not try and make something
for a change?

606
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,867
Ah!

607
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,638
Wow. San Francisco.

608
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,279
Save me!

609
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:14,923
Eek!

610
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,293
No more caffeine for you.

611
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,292
This little girl is wasting
her time.

612
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,896
6-2-6 cannot be taught to ignore
its destructive programming.

613
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,271
Ooh!

614
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,641
Push that over.

615
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,309
What are you doing?

616
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,473
Nothing!

617
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,312
Uh, say, I want to try it on.

618
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,817
No!

619
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,113
Share! Let me try it!

620
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,054
Hey! Ow! You're just jealous
'cause I'm pretty!

621
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,386
Don't move.

622
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,723
A mosquito has chosen me
as her perch.

623
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,387
She's so beautiful.

624
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,094
Look, another one.

625
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,328
And another one!
Why, it's a whole flock.

626
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,733
And they like me!

627
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:02,170
They're nuzzling my flesh
with their noses.

628
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,868
Now they're, um, they're...

629
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,340
I think it might be a koala.

630
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,576
An evil koala.

631
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,913
I can't even pet it.

632
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,215
It keeps staring at me,
like it's going to eat me.

633
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,884
Hello?

634
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,917
Nani?

635
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,891
Hello?

636
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,765
Are you there?

637
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,772
Now, this is interesting.

638
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,773
What?

639
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,935
6-2-6 was designed
to be a monster

640
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,140
but now he has nothing
to destroy.

641
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,310
You see, I never gave him
a greater purpose.

642
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:51,720
<i>What must it be like</i>
<i>to have nothing...</i>

643
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,623
<i>not even memories to visit</i>

644
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,684
<i>in the middle of the night?</i>

645
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:06,898
Nah!

646
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,075
Hmm.

647
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,206
Hmm...

648
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,955
That's the Ugly Duckling.

649
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,987
See? He's sad
because he's all alone

650
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,760
and nobody wants him

651
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,826
but on this page,
his family hears him crying

652
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,302
and they find him.

653
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,532
Then the Ugly Duckling is happy

654
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:45,007
because he knows
where he belongs.

655
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,172
Hmm...

656
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,010
Want to listen to the King?

657
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:00,284
You look like an Elvis fan.

658
00:41:04,748 --> 00:41:06,181
Nani.

659
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:07,683
Nani!

660
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:09,413
Uh... yeah?

661
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:11,284
Look.

662
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:36,212
Heard you lost your job.

663
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,737
Well, uh, actually,
I just quit that job

664
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:41,273
because, you know,
the hours are just not conducive

665
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:43,286
to the challenges
of raising a child...

666
00:41:44,321 --> 00:41:45,913
Hey!

667
00:41:46,957 --> 00:41:48,754
I am so sorry about that.

668
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:50,259
What is that thing?

669
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:51,693
That's my puppy.

670
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:54,755
Really?

671
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,760
Thus far, you have been adrift

672
00:41:58,836 --> 00:42:01,600
in the sheltered harbor
of my patience

673
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:04,369
but I cannot ignore
you being jobless.

674
00:42:04,408 --> 00:42:06,569
Do I make myself clear?

675
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,578
Perfectly.

676
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:10,136
And next time I see this dog

677
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,082
I expect it to be
a model citizen... capisce?

678
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:16,609
Uh... yes?

679
00:42:16,654 --> 00:42:17,712
New job.

680
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:20,813
Model citizen.

681
00:42:22,192 --> 00:42:23,489
Good day.

682
00:42:28,132 --> 00:42:29,190
Mrs. Hasagawa?

683
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:32,100
I'm here to answer
your newspaper ad.

684
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:34,036
Elvis Presley was
a model citizen.

685
00:42:35,706 --> 00:42:37,606
I've compiled a list
of his traits

686
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:38,733
for you to practice.

687
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:40,571
Number one is dancing.

688
00:42:40,611 --> 00:42:42,135
I can't talk now, dear.

689
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:44,739
I'm waiting for someone
to answer my ad.

690
00:42:44,848 --> 00:42:46,179
That's why I'm here.

691
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:47,478
Hands on your hips.

692
00:42:47,518 --> 00:42:49,486
Now follow my lead.

693
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:53,356
Ooh-hoo.

694
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:57,018
Ah! That's my want ad.

695
00:42:57,061 --> 00:42:58,961
I know!

696
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,127
Whoa, whoa!

697
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,305
Why is everything so dark?

698
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,432
I am all about coffee.

699
00:43:11,475 --> 00:43:12,703
Let's move on to step two.

700
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:15,440
Elvis played guitar. Here.

701
00:43:16,714 --> 00:43:20,480
Hold it like this,
and put your fingers here.

702
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,414
See? Now you try.

703
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:28,149
...and I make great cappuccinos
and lattes with...

704
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:30,456
I wish I could, Nani,
but I just hired Teddy

705
00:43:30,494 --> 00:43:32,189
and with tourist season
ending...

706
00:43:45,275 --> 00:43:46,401
Concierge-er-ing is my life.

707
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:49,438
I just love to answer phones...

708
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,845
This is the face of romance.

709
00:43:52,282 --> 00:43:55,547
She looks like
she could use some lovin'.

710
00:43:59,523 --> 00:44:01,320
Oh, we might have something.

711
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:03,053
Good. Now kiss her.

712
00:44:06,263 --> 00:44:09,426
I'm sure Elvis had
his bad days, too.

713
00:44:09,466 --> 00:44:10,455
I'm all about saving people?

714
00:44:12,035 --> 00:44:13,525
Actually, I do think
we have an opening.

715
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,537
Really?

716
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:15,538
Okay, this is it.

717
00:44:16,974 --> 00:44:18,202
Time to bring it all together.

718
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:19,539
Oh, that'd be so great!

719
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:22,010
You have no idea
how badly I need this job.

720
00:44:25,649 --> 00:44:26,616
It's all you!

721
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,878
Knock 'em dead!

722
00:44:50,474 --> 00:44:51,441
Don't crowd him!

723
00:44:58,649 --> 00:44:59,616
Hey, knock it off!

724
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:39,818
Hey, Lilo!

725
00:45:39,857 --> 00:45:42,553
Howzit... Nani?

726
00:45:42,593 --> 00:45:45,061
We've been having a bad day.

727
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:50,891
Hmm...

728
00:45:50,934 --> 00:45:52,959
Hey, I might not be a doctor

729
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:56,939
but I know that there's
no better cure for a sour face

730
00:45:56,974 --> 00:46:00,341
than a couple of boards
and some choice waves.

731
00:46:00,377 --> 00:46:02,845
What you think?

732
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,111
I think that's a great idea.

733
00:47:03,607 --> 00:47:05,973
Whoo!

734
00:47:06,009 --> 00:47:08,569
Whoo! Yeah!

735
00:48:06,169 --> 00:48:07,466
Oh, can't complain, Mom.

736
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:09,768
I'm camping out
with a convicted criminal

737
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:12,206
and, uh... oh, I had my head
chewed on by a monster!

738
00:48:12,242 --> 00:48:13,300
Wait...

739
00:48:13,343 --> 00:48:15,038
something is not right.

740
00:48:15,078 --> 00:48:17,842
6-2-6 is returning
willingly to water.

741
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:20,844
Oh, hold on, Mom...
another call.

742
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:24,586
Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue.

743
00:48:24,621 --> 00:48:25,952
I want a status report.

744
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:27,456
Oh, uh, things are going well.

745
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:28,480
He cannot swim!

746
00:48:28,525 --> 00:48:29,651
Things are going well.

747
00:48:29,693 --> 00:48:31,320
Jumba, aren't they going well?

748
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:32,828
Why will he risk drowning?

749
00:48:32,863 --> 00:48:34,160
Jumba?

750
00:48:34,197 --> 00:48:35,892
Jumba, help me out here.

751
00:48:35,932 --> 00:48:39,561
I would have expected you back
by now, with 6-2-6 in hand.

752
00:48:39,603 --> 00:48:43,004
Just a few things left to pack
and, uh, we'll be...

753
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,166
Hang up.

754
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:46,501
We are going swimming.

755
00:48:46,543 --> 00:48:47,669
Huh?

756
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:26,379
Yeah!

757
00:49:36,593 --> 00:49:38,060
Lilo!

758
00:49:39,096 --> 00:49:40,256
What happened?

759
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:44,233
Oh... some lolo must have
stuffed us in the barrel.

760
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:45,700
Where's Stitch?

761
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:49,227
Get off of her!

762
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:52,064
What happened?

763
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:54,407
Stitch dragged her down.

764
00:50:01,952 --> 00:50:03,920
We lost Stitch!

765
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,412
Lilo? Lilo, look at me.

766
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,076
Look at me, baby.
Are you hurt?

767
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,176
No.

768
00:50:40,056 --> 00:50:43,822
He's unconscious,
but I think he's alive.

769
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,570
David, take Lilo.

770
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:01,634
This isn't what it looks like.

771
00:51:01,678 --> 00:51:02,804
We were...

772
00:51:02,846 --> 00:51:05,337
It-It’s just that...

773
00:51:08,518 --> 00:51:10,452
I know you're trying, Nani

774
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:14,321
but you need to think
about what's best for Lilo...

775
00:51:14,357 --> 00:51:18,157
even if it removes you
from the picture.

776
00:51:21,865 --> 00:51:26,131
I'll be back tomorrow morning
for Lilo.

777
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:28,137
I'm sorry.

778
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:38,341
Nani? Is there something
I can do?

779
00:51:38,381 --> 00:51:39,643
No, David.

780
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:43,881
Uh, I need
to take Lilo home now.

781
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,481
We have a lot to talk about,
Lilo.

782
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:50,550
Thanks.

783
00:51:53,263 --> 00:51:58,428
You know, I really believed
they had a chance.

784
00:51:58,468 --> 00:52:02,268
Then you came along.

785
00:52:26,863 --> 00:52:29,855
Lilo, honey...

786
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:33,835
we have to, uh...

787
00:52:35,438 --> 00:52:36,735
Don't worry.

788
00:52:36,773 --> 00:52:39,708
You're nice, and someone
will give you a job.

789
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:42,405
I would.

790
00:52:45,282 --> 00:52:46,874
Come here.

791
00:53:49,913 --> 00:53:52,746
That's us before...

792
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:56,752
It was rainy,
and they went for a drive.

793
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,621
What happened to yours?

794
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:04,320
I hear you cry at night.

795
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:06,158
Do you dream about them?

796
00:54:09,299 --> 00:54:11,597
I know that's
why you wreck things

797
00:54:11,634 --> 00:54:13,625
and push me.

798
00:54:18,908 --> 00:54:23,607
Our family's little now
and we don't have many toys

799
00:54:23,646 --> 00:54:27,946
but if you want,
you could be part of it.

800
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:32,853
You could be our baby
and we'd raise you to be good.

801
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:38,460
"O'hana" means family.

802
00:54:38,495 --> 00:54:43,489
"Family" means nobody gets
left behind

803
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:48,061
but if you want to leave,
you can.

804
00:54:53,643 --> 00:54:58,012
I'll remember you, though.

805
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:01,574
I remember everyone that leaves.

806
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:32,881
I... I...

807
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:35,316
Lost.

808
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:45,618
I'm lost.

809
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:52,592
Help!

810
00:55:52,635 --> 00:55:54,728
I don't like the ocean!

811
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,730
Oh, look,
a friendly little dolphin.

812
00:55:59,976 --> 00:56:01,603
They helped sailors
in the war...

813
00:56:01,644 --> 00:56:03,441
It's a shark!

814
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,209
It's a shark,
and it ain't friendly!

815
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:06,374
It looks like a dolphin.

816
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:07,508
Tricky fish! Tricky fish!

817
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:08,881
Oh, octopus, come and help me?

818
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:11,887
An octo... octopus is worse
than a shark!

819
00:56:11,921 --> 00:56:13,548
I hate this planet!

820
00:56:18,928 --> 00:56:20,919
Oh...

821
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:24,297
little monster!

822
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:33,101
Uh, Agent Pleakley here.

823
00:56:33,142 --> 00:56:35,576
I have lost patience
with you both.

824
00:56:35,612 --> 00:56:38,945
Have you captured 6-2-6 or not?

825
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:39,971
Um...

826
00:56:40,016 --> 00:56:41,608
Uh-uh...

827
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:43,812
Consider yourselves fired
and prisonbound.

828
00:56:43,853 --> 00:56:47,619
Your incompetence is nothing
short of unspeakable!

829
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:49,951
But, uh...mm...

830
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:54,152
We're fired!

831
00:56:54,197 --> 00:56:56,665
Now we do it my way!

832
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:57,825
Your way?

833
00:56:58,968 --> 00:57:00,526
Oh... uh, wait!

834
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:03,164
It seems I have overestimated
Jumber and Blinkley.

835
00:57:03,206 --> 00:57:05,436
Uh, Jumba and Pleakley.

836
00:57:05,475 --> 00:57:08,239
Whatever. The mission
is in jeopardy.

837
00:57:08,278 --> 00:57:13,181
This could be your chance to
redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.

838
00:57:13,216 --> 00:57:16,379
How soon will you be prepared
to leave?

839
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:19,411
Immediately.

840
00:57:33,836 --> 00:57:34,803
Don't run.

841
00:57:34,837 --> 00:57:36,668
Don't make me shoot you.

842
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:39,834
You were expensive.

843
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:41,673
Yes. Yes, that's it.

844
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:44,339
Come quietly.

845
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,177
Mm... waiting.

846
00:57:46,215 --> 00:57:47,182
For what?

847
00:57:50,086 --> 00:57:52,384
Family.

848
00:57:52,422 --> 00:57:54,686
Ah!

849
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:56,715
You don't have one.

850
00:57:56,759 --> 00:57:59,353
I made you.

851
00:57:59,395 --> 00:58:02,728
Oh... maybe I could...

852
00:58:02,832 --> 00:58:04,823
You're built to destroy.

853
00:58:04,867 --> 00:58:09,304
You can never belong.

854
00:58:09,339 --> 00:58:11,967
Now come quietly
and we will take you apart.

855
00:58:12,008 --> 00:58:13,999
No, no, no, no,
don't, don't run!

856
00:58:14,043 --> 00:58:15,169
Don't run!

857
00:58:30,727 --> 00:58:31,853
Lilo.

858
00:58:32,895 --> 00:58:34,726
I didn't hear you get up.

859
00:58:37,066 --> 00:58:38,795
Baby, what's wrong?

860
00:58:38,835 --> 00:58:40,564
Stitch left.

861
00:58:40,603 --> 00:58:41,900
Really?

862
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:44,270
It's good he's gone.

863
00:58:44,307 --> 00:58:47,708
He didn't want to be here,
anyway.

864
00:58:47,777 --> 00:58:49,369
We don't need him.

865
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:54,708
Lilo...

866
00:58:54,784 --> 00:58:57,617
sometimes you try your hardest

867
00:58:57,654 --> 00:59:02,421
but things don't work out
the way you want them to.

868
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:05,427
Sometimes things have to change

869
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:09,659
and maybe sometimes
they're for the better...

870
00:59:09,766 --> 00:59:11,233
even if...

871
00:59:12,769 --> 00:59:15,795
Nani!

872
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:17,669
David!

873
00:59:17,707 --> 00:59:19,231
I think I found you a job.

874
00:59:19,275 --> 00:59:20,469
You what?!

875
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:23,138
Old man Kukhkini's store,
but we got to hurry.

876
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:26,012
Oh, um, okay. Lilo?

877
00:59:26,049 --> 00:59:27,607
Baby, this is really important.

878
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,675
I need you to stay here
for a few minutes.

879
00:59:29,786 --> 00:59:31,151
I'm going to be right back.

880
00:59:31,187 --> 00:59:34,452
Lock the door and don't
answer it for anyone, okay?

881
00:59:35,858 --> 00:59:39,157
Things are finally
turning around.

882
00:59:39,195 --> 00:59:41,322
Aw, David, I owe you one.

883
00:59:41,364 --> 00:59:42,922
That's okay.

884
00:59:42,965 --> 00:59:45,559
You can just date me,
and we'll call it even.

885
00:59:51,574 --> 00:59:53,701
Come back here, you little!

886
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,707
Stitch?

887
00:59:58,748 --> 00:59:59,874
What is it?

888
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,213
Shh!

889
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:04,983
Oh, hiding
behind your little friend

890
01:00:05,021 --> 01:00:06,318
won't work anymore.

891
01:00:06,355 --> 01:00:07,583
Didn't I tell you?

892
01:00:07,623 --> 01:00:09,386
We got fired this morning.

893
01:00:10,693 --> 01:00:12,820
New rules.

894
01:00:12,862 --> 01:00:14,659
Ha!

895
01:00:14,697 --> 01:00:15,664
Ooh.

896
01:00:16,899 --> 01:00:18,526
Oh, ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!

897
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:23,467
What are we going to do?

898
01:00:24,907 --> 01:00:26,067
Ooh! I love this song!

899
01:00:26,109 --> 01:00:27,133
Pliers.

900
01:00:28,177 --> 01:00:29,144
Screwdriver.

901
01:00:29,178 --> 01:00:30,202
Check.

902
01:00:30,246 --> 01:00:31,213
Come out, my friend

903
01:00:31,247 --> 01:00:32,680
from whomever
you're hiding behind.

904
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:37,816
What the?

905
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:40,015
Ooh!

906
01:00:41,824 --> 01:00:42,791
Come on!

907
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:43,883
What's the big deal?

908
01:00:45,361 --> 01:00:47,795
I'll put you
back together again.

909
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:50,628
I'll make you taller
and not so fluffy!

910
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:52,600
I like fluffy!

911
01:00:52,635 --> 01:00:54,227
No... No...

912
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:55,897
No!

913
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,609
Oh, leave my mother
out of this!

914
01:01:02,044 --> 01:01:04,137
You could do with a makeover.

915
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,546
I tried
to give you my good looks

916
01:01:06,582 --> 01:01:09,449
but let's face it,
something went wrong.

917
01:01:09,485 --> 01:01:10,611
No!

918
01:01:14,624 --> 01:01:15,682
Quick! Follow me!

919
01:01:15,725 --> 01:01:16,714
If we make it to...

920
01:01:16,826 --> 01:01:17,724
You're alive!

921
01:01:17,827 --> 01:01:18,987
They're all over the place!

922
01:01:20,296 --> 01:01:22,264
Running away? Here...

923
01:01:22,298 --> 01:01:23,822
let me stop you.

924
01:01:26,002 --> 01:01:28,163
You always get
in the way!

925
01:01:28,204 --> 01:01:29,171
Where's the girl?

926
01:01:29,205 --> 01:01:30,604
What have you done
to the girl?

927
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,868
Hello? Cobra Bubbles?

928
01:01:31,908 --> 01:01:34,274
Aliens are attacking my house.

929
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:37,040
No, no, no!
No aliens!

930
01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:41,642
Blue punch buggy!

931
01:01:43,219 --> 01:01:44,481
No punch back.

932
01:01:45,521 --> 01:01:46,647
They want my dog!

933
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:48,452
There's no need
to alert the authorities.

934
01:01:48,491 --> 01:01:49,651
Everything's under control.

935
01:01:49,692 --> 01:01:51,683
Lilo, who was that?

936
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:53,752
Oh, good,
my dog found the chainsaw.

937
01:01:53,796 --> 01:01:54,956
Lilo! Don't hang!

938
01:02:02,772 --> 01:02:04,433
Ha!

939
01:02:04,473 --> 01:02:05,565
You shouldn't play with guns.

940
01:02:05,608 --> 01:02:06,575
Oh, okay.

941
01:02:06,609 --> 01:02:07,576
Thank you.

942
01:02:09,045 --> 01:02:10,842
Oh, I just remembered.
It's your birthday!

943
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,847
Happy birthday!

944
01:02:11,881 --> 01:02:12,848
Merry Christmas!

945
01:02:12,882 --> 01:02:13,849
It's not Christmas.

946
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:14,850
Happy Hanukkah!

947
01:02:14,884 --> 01:02:15,851
We're leaving Stitch?

948
01:02:15,885 --> 01:02:16,852
Trust me.

949
01:02:16,886 --> 01:02:18,251
This is not going to end well.

950
01:02:18,287 --> 01:02:19,686
- One potato.
- Two potato.

951
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:21,189
- Three potato.
- Four.

952
01:02:21,224 --> 01:02:22,714
- Five potato.
- Six potato.

953
01:02:22,792 --> 01:02:24,089
Seven potato, more.

954
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:26,060
My... mother... told... me...

955
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:27,062
you... are... it.

956
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:28,427
Oh, I win!

957
01:02:36,038 --> 01:02:37,665
Thanks. <i>Mahalo</i> plenty.

958
01:02:37,707 --> 01:02:38,833
You won't be disappointed.

959
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:41,173
I'll show up early to help
with the morning deliver...

960
01:02:44,714 --> 01:02:46,682
Oh, don't turn left.

961
01:02:49,418 --> 01:02:50,851
No.

962
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:59,252
One of them had a giant eye
in the middle of his face.

963
01:02:59,295 --> 01:03:00,762
Oh, Lilo!

964
01:03:02,899 --> 01:03:05,094
Please don't do this.

965
01:03:05,134 --> 01:03:07,329
You know I have no choice.

966
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:09,065
No! You're not taking her!

967
01:03:09,105 --> 01:03:11,096
I'm the only one
who understands her!

968
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,108
You take that away,
she won't stand a chance!

969
01:03:13,142 --> 01:03:15,201
You're making this harder
than it needs to be.

970
01:03:15,244 --> 01:03:17,405
You don't know
what you're doing! She needs me!

971
01:03:17,446 --> 01:03:19,607
Is this what she needs?!

972
01:03:19,649 --> 01:03:22,812
It seems clear to me
that you need her

973
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:25,446
a lot more than she needs you.

974
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:32,156
Lilo! Lilo!

975
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:33,491
Lilo!

976
01:03:33,529 --> 01:03:35,326
Lilo!

977
01:03:35,364 --> 01:03:36,922
Lilo!

978
01:03:43,339 --> 01:03:44,863
Lilo!

979
01:03:44,907 --> 01:03:46,932
Lilo!

980
01:03:55,918 --> 01:03:58,045
You ruined everything.

981
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:07,891
You're one of them?

982
01:04:08,931 --> 01:04:09,955
Ooh!

983
01:04:09,999 --> 01:04:11,694
Get out of here, Stitch.

984
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:16,939
Surprise!

985
01:04:18,341 --> 01:04:21,538
And here I thought
you'd be difficult to catch.

986
01:04:21,577 --> 01:04:24,842
Ho-ho-ho. Silly me.

987
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,847
Lilo?

988
01:04:27,216 --> 01:04:29,343
Lilo!

989
01:04:40,629 --> 01:04:43,530
There you go,
all buckled up for the trip.

990
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:47,526
And look... I even caught you
a little snack.

991
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:56,741
No! Stop!

992
01:05:06,655 --> 01:05:08,520
Lilo.

993
01:05:10,292 --> 01:05:11,589
Aah!

994
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:12,924
Okay, talk.

995
01:05:12,962 --> 01:05:14,793
I know you had something
to do with this.

996
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,127
Now where is Lilo?

997
01:05:16,165 --> 01:05:18,963
Talk! I know you can.

998
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:22,971
Okay, okay.

999
01:05:25,941 --> 01:05:28,705
Where's Lilo?

1000
01:05:28,778 --> 01:05:30,575
Lilo...

1001
01:05:33,783 --> 01:05:35,410
Now all your washing is up!

1002
01:05:35,451 --> 01:05:36,713
You're under arrest!

1003
01:05:36,752 --> 01:05:38,014
Read him his rights.

1004
01:05:38,054 --> 01:05:40,079
Listen carefully.

1005
01:05:42,725 --> 01:05:44,317
Hello? Galactic Command?

1006
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,022
Experiment 6-2-6 is in custody.

1007
01:05:47,063 --> 01:05:49,088
We'll wait right here.

1008
01:05:56,839 --> 01:05:58,033
Huh?

1009
01:05:58,074 --> 01:06:01,066
Don't interact with her.

1010
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,138
Where's Lilo?

1011
01:06:06,182 --> 01:06:07,149
Who?

1012
01:06:07,183 --> 01:06:08,309
What?!

1013
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:13,488
Lilo... my sister.

1014
01:06:15,424 --> 01:06:18,325
Uh, sorry, we do not know

1015
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,920
anyone by this, uh...

1016
01:06:20,963 --> 01:06:22,828
Lilo! She's a little girl...
this big!

1017
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:24,560
She has black hair
and brown eyes

1018
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,534
and she hangs around
with that thing!

1019
01:06:26,569 --> 01:06:27,866
Uh...

1020
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,670
We know her.

1021
01:06:31,707 --> 01:06:34,301
Bring her back.

1022
01:06:34,343 --> 01:06:36,140
Oh, we can't do that. Uh-uh.

1023
01:06:36,178 --> 01:06:38,703
That would be a misuse
of Galactic resources.

1024
01:06:38,814 --> 01:06:42,716
See, problem is...
we’re just here for him.

1025
01:06:42,785 --> 01:06:45,049
So she's gone?

1026
01:06:45,087 --> 01:06:46,452
Look at the bright side.

1027
01:06:46,489 --> 01:06:48,719
You won't have to yell
at anyone anymore.

1028
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,829
Come.

1029
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:11,343
O'hana.

1030
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,347
Huh?

1031
01:07:12,381 --> 01:07:13,678
Hey! Get away from her.

1032
01:07:13,749 --> 01:07:16,047
No! What did you say?

1033
01:07:16,085 --> 01:07:20,112
O'hana means family.

1034
01:07:20,156 --> 01:07:22,090
Family means...

1035
01:07:22,124 --> 01:07:24,786
...nobody gets left behind.

1036
01:07:24,827 --> 01:07:26,692
Or forgotten.

1037
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:28,060
Yeah.

1038
01:07:30,299 --> 01:07:31,994
Hey...

1039
01:07:32,034 --> 01:07:35,231
What?!
After all you put me through

1040
01:07:35,271 --> 01:07:38,399
you expect me to help you
just like that?!

1041
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,203
Just like that?!

1042
01:07:40,242 --> 01:07:41,539
<i>Ih.</i>

1043
01:07:41,577 --> 01:07:43,204
Fine.

1044
01:07:43,245 --> 01:07:44,974
Fine?
You're doing what he says?

1045
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:47,278
Uh, he's very persuasive.

1046
01:07:47,316 --> 01:07:50,843
Persuasive?!
What exactly are we doing?

1047
01:07:50,886 --> 01:07:51,978
Rescue.

1048
01:07:52,021 --> 01:07:53,420
We're going to get Lilo?

1049
01:07:53,455 --> 01:07:54,615
<i>Ih.</i>

1050
01:07:56,892 --> 01:08:00,055
Oh, good! I was hoping
to add theft, endangerment

1051
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:03,087
and insanity to my list
of things I did today.

1052
01:08:03,132 --> 01:08:04,326
You, too?

1053
01:08:10,206 --> 01:08:11,935
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1054
01:08:11,974 --> 01:08:14,135
What? Did you think
we walked here?

1055
01:08:15,744 --> 01:08:18,975
<i>This is Gantu, requesting</i>
<i>hyperspace clearance.</i>

1056
01:08:19,014 --> 01:08:21,005
<i>Stand by for clearance.</i>

1057
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:08,427
<i>Clearance is granted</i>
<i>on vector C-12.</i>

1058
01:09:08,464 --> 01:09:10,159
Connect me
to the Grand Councilwoman.

1059
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:12,190
Gantu, what's going on?

1060
01:09:12,234 --> 01:09:13,565
I thought you'd like to know

1061
01:09:13,602 --> 01:09:15,433
that the little abomination
is... is...

1062
01:09:20,442 --> 01:09:22,376
Yes, Captain?

1063
01:09:24,747 --> 01:09:27,307
I'll call you back.

1064
01:09:31,487 --> 01:09:33,546
How did you get out of there?

1065
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:39,219
So what exactly are we doing?

1066
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:41,695
Don't worry,
is all part of plan.

1067
01:09:41,764 --> 01:09:43,322
We are professionals.

1068
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:45,856
Hey! Get that out of your mouth!

1069
01:09:53,142 --> 01:09:55,474
Hold on!

1070
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,084
Okay, is show time!

1071
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,569
This is it!

1072
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,141
Go! Go! Go!

1073
01:10:42,024 --> 01:10:44,720
Little savage!
Get off my ship!

1074
01:10:49,431 --> 01:10:50,921
Stitch!

1075
01:11:04,046 --> 01:11:07,709
Computer,
locate Experiment 6-2-6.

1076
01:11:07,783 --> 01:11:09,842
6-2-6 located.

1077
01:11:09,885 --> 01:11:12,217
We finish this now.

1078
01:11:14,923 --> 01:11:16,447
Stitch is unconscious.

1079
01:11:16,492 --> 01:11:17,720
What do we do now?

1080
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,727
We stay close.

1081
01:11:18,761 --> 01:11:20,092
Hope for a miracle.

1082
01:11:20,129 --> 01:11:21,721
That's all we can do.

1083
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:34,272
No!

1084
01:11:36,078 --> 01:11:37,978
Don't leave me, okay?

1085
01:11:38,013 --> 01:11:39,207
Okay.

1086
01:11:41,683 --> 01:11:43,651
Okay.

1087
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:49,884
Okay.

1088
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,064
Target 6-2-6 is in motion.

1089
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:00,398
Speed is 84.

1090
01:12:00,436 --> 01:12:02,529
Impossible!

1091
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,224
Stitch!

1092
01:12:29,264 --> 01:12:30,322
Hmm?

1093
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,224
Abomination.

1094
01:12:33,268 --> 01:12:34,599
Stupidhead.

1095
01:12:39,808 --> 01:12:41,503
Yee-haw!

1096
01:12:43,946 --> 01:12:44,878
Aloha!

1097
01:12:46,381 --> 01:12:48,747
You're vile! You're foul!
You're flawed!

1098
01:12:48,817 --> 01:12:51,445
Also cute and fluffy!

1099
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:05,861
You came back.

1100
01:13:05,901 --> 01:13:08,165
Nobody gets left behind.

1101
01:13:16,778 --> 01:13:17,836
Lilo!

1102
01:13:23,919 --> 01:13:25,682
Good dog.

1103
01:13:41,136 --> 01:13:42,899
<i>Auwe!</i>

1104
01:13:42,938 --> 01:13:44,997
David!

1105
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,132
Hey, Lilo.

1106
01:13:46,174 --> 01:13:48,404
Can you give us a ride
to shore?

1107
01:13:48,443 --> 01:13:49,569
Uh...

1108
01:13:50,979 --> 01:13:52,378
Sure!

1109
01:13:52,414 --> 01:13:55,247
But I have to make two trips.

1110
01:13:55,851 --> 01:13:58,012
So you're from outer space, huh?

1111
01:13:58,053 --> 01:13:59,577
I heard the surfing's choice.

1112
01:13:59,621 --> 01:14:01,919
We have 6-2-6.

1113
01:14:01,957 --> 01:14:03,720
Take him to my ship.

1114
01:14:03,759 --> 01:14:05,056
Leave him alone.

1115
01:14:05,093 --> 01:14:06,060
Hold on.

1116
01:14:06,094 --> 01:14:08,085
Grand Councilwoman,
let me explain.

1117
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,427
Silence!

1118
01:14:09,464 --> 01:14:13,525
I am retiring you,
Captain Gantu.

1119
01:14:13,569 --> 01:14:16,436
Actually, credit for the capture
goes to...

1120
01:14:16,471 --> 01:14:17,699
Goes to <i>me.</i>

1121
01:14:17,806 --> 01:14:20,400
You'll be lucky if you end up
on a Fluff Trog farm

1122
01:14:20,442 --> 01:14:22,342
after we sort this thing out.

1123
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:23,674
Uh...

1124
01:14:23,712 --> 01:14:24,906
I think I should...

1125
01:14:24,947 --> 01:14:25,914
You!

1126
01:14:25,948 --> 01:14:27,176
You're the cause of all this!

1127
01:14:27,215 --> 01:14:28,876
If it wasn't
for your Experiment 6-2-6

1128
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:29,884
none of this...

1129
01:14:29,918 --> 01:14:31,886
Stitch.

1130
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,251
What?

1131
01:14:33,288 --> 01:14:35,085
My name Stitch.

1132
01:14:35,123 --> 01:14:36,420
Stitch, then.

1133
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:39,586
If it wasn't for Stitch...

1134
01:14:40,929 --> 01:14:43,261
Does Stitch have to go
in the ship?

1135
01:14:43,298 --> 01:14:46,096
Yes.

1136
01:14:46,134 --> 01:14:48,102
Can Stitch say good-bye?

1137
01:14:49,404 --> 01:14:50,837
Yes.

1138
01:14:50,872 --> 01:14:52,863
Thank you.

1139
01:14:56,979 --> 01:14:59,812
Who are you?

1140
01:15:01,383 --> 01:15:03,874
This is my family.

1141
01:15:03,919 --> 01:15:07,685
I found it all on my own.

1142
01:15:07,789 --> 01:15:11,281
It's little and broken...

1143
01:15:11,326 --> 01:15:13,260
but still good.

1144
01:15:13,295 --> 01:15:15,957
Yeah. Still good.

1145
01:15:25,774 --> 01:15:27,264
Does he really have to go?

1146
01:15:28,644 --> 01:15:32,512
You know as well as I
that our laws are absolute.

1147
01:15:32,547 --> 01:15:36,108
I cannot change
what the Council has decided.

1148
01:15:36,151 --> 01:15:40,315
Lilo, didn't you buy
that thing at the shelter?

1149
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:45,387
Hey!

1150
01:15:47,062 --> 01:15:50,327
Three days ago,
I bought Stitch at the shelter.

1151
01:15:50,365 --> 01:15:52,299
I paid two dollars for him.

1152
01:15:52,334 --> 01:15:54,234
See this stamp? I own him.

1153
01:15:54,269 --> 01:15:58,035
If you take him,
you're stealing.

1154
01:15:59,608 --> 01:16:02,736
Aliens are all about rules.

1155
01:16:02,811 --> 01:16:05,245
You look familiar.

1156
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:09,580
CIA. Roswell. 1973.

1157
01:16:09,618 --> 01:16:12,485
Ah, yes. You had hair then.

1158
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:14,955
Take note of this.

1159
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:19,552
This creature has been sentenced
to life in exile

1160
01:16:19,594 --> 01:16:24,657
a sentence that shall be
henceforth served out here...

1161
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:29,296
on Earth...

1162
01:16:29,337 --> 01:16:33,273
and as caretaker
of the alien life-form, Stitch

1163
01:16:33,308 --> 01:16:37,472
this family is now
under the official protection

1164
01:16:37,512 --> 01:16:40,413
of the United Galactic
Federation.

1165
01:16:40,449 --> 01:16:43,441
We'll be checking in
now and then.

1166
01:16:43,485 --> 01:16:46,181
I was afraid
you were going to say that.

1167
01:16:46,221 --> 01:16:49,816
This won't be easy to explain
back at headquarters.

1168
01:16:49,858 --> 01:16:53,350
I know what you mean.

1169
01:16:56,531 --> 01:16:59,364
Don't let those two
get on my ship.

1170
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:10,568
CIA?

1171
01:17:10,612 --> 01:17:11,601
Former.

1172
01:17:11,646 --> 01:17:13,671
Saved the planet once.

1173
01:17:13,715 --> 01:17:15,945
Convinced an alien race
that mosquitoes

1174
01:17:15,984 --> 01:17:17,576
