00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,404
Isn't this great?
The salty sea air,

8
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,373
- the wind blowing in your face.
- [barks]

9
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:21,039
- A perfect day to be at sea.
- Oh, yes, delightful. [retches]

10
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,208
A fine strong wind
and a following sea.

11
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,583
King Triton must be
in a friendly type mood.

12
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,351
- King Triton?
- Ruler of the Merpeople, lad.

13
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,120
Thought every good sailor
knew about him.

14
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,752
Merpeople.

15
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,390
Eric, pay no attention
to this nautical nonsense.

16
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,128
But it ain't nonsense. It's the truth.

17
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:47,105
I'm tellin' ya! Down in the depths
of the ocean they live! Oh!

18
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,162
Aah!

I'm really looking forward
to this performance, Sebastian.

31
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,049
[chuckles] Your Majesty!

32
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:15,417
This will be the finest concert
I have ever conducted.

33
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,753
Your daughters,
they will be spectacular!

34
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,555
- [whinnies]
- Yes.

35
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,962
- Especially my little Ariel.
- Yes, yes.

36
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:30,264
She has the most beautiful voice. Hmm?

37
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,430
If only she'd show up
for rehearsals once in a while.

38
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:37,067
- [orchestra tunes up]

[male voice] Ariel, wait for me.

52
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,505
Flounder, hurry up.

53
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:47,512
[pants] You know I can't swim that fast.

54
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,606
There it is.

55
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,015
[Ariel] Isn't it fantastic?

56
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:57,113
Yeah, sure. It's great.
Now let's get outta here.

57
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,159
Oh! You're not getting
cold fins now, are you?

58
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,228
Who, me? No way.

59
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,323
It's just... It, uh...
It looks damp in there. Yeah.

60
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,664
And I think I may be
coming down with something.

61
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,502
Yeah, I got this cough. [coughs]

62
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,098
[whispers] All right. I'm going inside.

63
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,370
You can just stay here
and watch for sharks.

64
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,536
OK.

65
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,807
[whispering] Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and...

66
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,873
What? Sharks? Ariel!

67
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,149
[grunts]
Ariel, I can't... I mean...

68
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,816
- Ariel, help!
- [laughs]

69
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,758
- Oh, Flounder.
- [whispers] Ariel.

70
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,694
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

71
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,755
Flounder, don't be such a guppy.

72
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,926
I'm not a guppy. [grunts]

73
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,862
This is great.

74
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,873
I mean, I really love this.

75
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:53,742
Excitement, adventure, danger
lurking around every corner...

[grunts] Oh, are you OK?

78
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,247
Yeah, sure. No problem. I'm OK.

79
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,280
Shh!

80
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,793
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!

81
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,461
Have you ever seen anything so
wonderful in your entire life?

82
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,234
Wow! Cool! But, uh, what is it?

83
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,435
I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.

84
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,478
What was that?

85
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,309
Did you hear something?

86
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,747
Mmm? I wonder what this one is.

87
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,945
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?

88
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,284
Nothing is going to happen.

89
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,380
- [growls]
- Shark!

90
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,222
Shark! We're gonna die!

91
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,030
[Flounder screams]

92
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,805
Oh, no!

93
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,507

You big bully! [blows raspberry]

[Ariel chuckles]

99
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,137
Flounder, you really are a guppy.

100
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,807
I am not.

101

- Whoa!

105
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,894
Mermaid off the port bow!

106
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,903
[shouts] Ariel, how you doin', kid?

107
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:02,668
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.

108
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,677
We were in this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy...

109
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:09,078
Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see.

110
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:17,316
Oh! Oh! Look at this.

111
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,826
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

112
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,920
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

113
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,296
Humans use these little babies...

114
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,335
to straighten their hair out.

115
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:35,170
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and violee...

116
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,177
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair

117
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,338
that humans go nuts over.

118
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,439
A dinglehopper.

119
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,245
- What about that one?
- Ah!

120
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:51,120
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!

121
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,457
- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
- [both] Oh!

122
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:01,762
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical
times when humans used to sit around

123
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,065
and stare at each other all day.

124
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,105
Got very boring.

125
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,701
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.

126
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,075
Allow me.

127
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,636
- [Scuttle coughs]
- Music!

128
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,013
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!

129
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,484
Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!

130
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,918
The concert was today?

131
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,218
You could make
a little planter out of it.

132
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,623
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!

133
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,251
Any time, sweetie!

134
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,489
Any time.

135
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:49,337
Yes, hurry home, Princess.

136
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:54,819
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's
celebration, now, would we?

137
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:59,517
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!

138
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:04,586
In my day, we had fantastical feasts,

139
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,896
- when I lived in the palace.
- [whimpers]

140
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,094
[gulps]

141
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,694
And now look at me.

142
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,570
Wasted away to practically nothing.

143
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:19,702
Banished and exiled
and practically starving,

144
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:24,807
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

145
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:29,912
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

146
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,184
Flotsam! Jetsam!

147
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:37,491
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.

148
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:42,626
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.

149
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:50,533
I just don't know what we're
going to do with you, young lady.

150
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,201
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.

151
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,371
As a result of your careless behavior...

152
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,278
Careless and reckless behavior!

153
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,578
...the entire celebration was, uh...

154
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,314
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

155
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,549
This concert was to be

156
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:08,218
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.

157
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:12,060
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom!

158
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,723
But it wasn't her fault...

159
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,462
Uh, well, first, uh,
the shark chased us.

160
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,028
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...

161
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,304
[growls] And... And we... Whoa!

162
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,310
[sighs] And then we were safe.

163
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,142
But then this seagull came,
and it was, "This is this..."

164
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,876
Seagull?

165
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,680
- [gasps]
- What? Oh!

166
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,846
You went up to the surface again,
didn't you?

167
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,389
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

168
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:42,689
Oh, Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?

169
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,392
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans!

170
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,026
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

171
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,095
Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?

172
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,664
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

173
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,438
Don't you take that tone of voice
with me, young lady!

174
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,946
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules!

175
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,917
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!

176
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:10,388
And I am never... never to hear of you
going to the surface again!

177
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,447
Is that clear?

178
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,223
Hmph! Teenagers.

179
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,597
They think they know everything.

180
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,331
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

181
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,398
Do you think I was too hard on her?

182
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,603
Definitely not.

183
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:37,741
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

184
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,412
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.

185
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,354
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

186
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,187
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

187
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,921
Ariel needs constant supervision.

188
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,759
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

189
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,924
All the time.

190
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,661
And you are just the crab to do it.

191
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,302
[Sebastian] How do I get myself
into these situations?

192
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,364
I should be writing symphonies,

193
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:07,105
not tagging along after
some headstrong teenager.

194

Ariel, are you OK?

[Ariel] If only I could
make him understand.

200
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,654
I just don't see things the way he does.

201
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,929
I don't see how a world
that makes such wonderful things

Daydreaming, singing to herself.

467
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,620
You haven't noticed, hmm?

468
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,529
Oh, well, I...

469
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,000
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

470
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:29,973
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

471
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,272
[gulps] Keeping something?

472
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,278
About Ariel?

473
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,852
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

474
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,448
[whimpers] I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

475
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,653
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!

476
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:55,461
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

477
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,094
Humans? [chuckles nervously]

478
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:03,867
Who said anything about humans? [yelps]

479
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:04,075
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

480
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:08,375
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

481
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:12,075
You'll see. It's a surprise.

482
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,209
Oh, Flounder.

483
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,278
Flounder, you're the best!

484
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,918
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

485
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:28,057
[giggles] Why, Eric, run away with you?

486
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,829
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.

487
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,928
[laughs]

488
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,165
[gasps]

489
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,173
Daddy?

490
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,571
I consider myself a reasonable merman.

491
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,609
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.

492
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,177
But, Dad, I...

493
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,520
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?

494
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,581
I had to...

495
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,255
Contact between the human world
and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

496
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,127
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

497
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,693
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

498
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,034
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

499
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,200
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

500
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,709
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fish-eaters

501
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,211
incapable of any feeling...

502
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,214
Daddy, I love him! [gasps]

503
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:22,548
No! Have you lost
your senses completely?

504
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,554
He's a human. You're a mermaid.

505
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,112
I don't care.

506
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,320
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

507
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:34,262
And if this is the only way, so be it!

508
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,835
Daddy! No!

509
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,498
No! Please!

510
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:46,270
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!

511
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,208
Daddy, no!

512
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,983
[Ariel sobs]

513
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,673
Ariel, I...

514
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,073
[sobs] Just go away.

515
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:43,025
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.

516
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,003
She has a very serious problem.

517
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:51,405
If only there were
something we could do.

518
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,410
But there is something.

519
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:59,142
Who... Who are you?

520
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,447
Don't be scared.

521
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,750
We represent someone who can help you.

522
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:09,919
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

523
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,019
[both] Just imagine...

524
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,087
You and your prince...

525
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,692
Together forever.

526
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,702
I don't understand.

527
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:25,606
Ursula has great powers.

528
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:29,635
[gasps] The sea witch?

529
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,979
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.

530
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,110
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!

531
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,417
Suit yourself.

532
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,722
It was only a suggestion.

533
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,360
Wait.

534
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,895
[both] Yes?

535
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:01,274
- [sniffles] Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

536
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,779
It was an accident. [mutters]

537
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,908
Ariel? Where are you going?

538
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,612
Ariel, what are you doing here
with this riffraff?

539
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,587
I'm going to see Ursula.

540
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:16,116
[gasps] Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

541
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,492
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

542
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:24,364
But... But, I... Come on!

543
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,511
This way.

544
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,861
[creatures moan]

545
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,931
[gasps, grunts]

546
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,333
[pants]

547
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:03,669
[Ursula] Come in. Come in, my child.

548
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:08,974
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.

549
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:13,005
One might question
your upbringing. [chuckles]

550
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,585
Now, then, you're here

551
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:22,615
because you have a thing for
this human, this prince fellow.

552
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:28,290
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

553
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,891
Well, angelfish,

554
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:35,837
the solution to your problem is simple.

555
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,931
The only way to get what you want

556
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,999
is to become a human yourself.

557
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:43,205
[gasps] Can you do that?

558
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:49,719
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.

559
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,812
It's what I live for.

560
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:56,155
To help unfortunate merfolk,
like yourself,

561
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:02,393
poor souls with no one else to turn to.

562
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,958
# <i>I admit that in the past</i>
<i>I've been a nasty</i>

563
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,699
# <i>They weren't kidding when</i>
<i>they called me, well, a witch</i>

564
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:13,107
# <i>But you'll find that nowadays</i>
<i>I've mended all my ways</i>

565
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,611
# <i>Repented, seen the light</i>
<i>and made a switch</i>

566
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,011
True? Yes.

567
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,882
# <i>And I fortunately know a little magic</i>

568
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:25,080
# <i>It's a talent that</i>
<i>I always have possessed</i>

569
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,648
# <i>And here lately, please don't</i>

570
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,627
# <i>Of the miserable, lonely and depressed</i>

571
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,925
Pathetic.

572
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:37,092
# <i>Poor unfortunate souls</i>

573
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,331
# <i>In pain, in need</i>

574
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,962
# <i>This one longing to be thinner</i>

575
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,529
# <i>That one wants to get the girl</i>

576
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,701
# <i>And do I help them? Yes, indeed</i>

577
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:52,647
# <i>Those poor, unfortunate souls</i>
<i>So sad, so true</i>

578
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,308
# <i>They come flocking to my cauldron</i>

# <i>Crying spells, Ursula, please</i>

580
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,456
# <i>And I help them</i>
<i>Yes, I do</i>

581
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,491
# <i>Now it's happened once or twice</i>

582
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,652
# <i>Someone couldn't pay the price</i>

583
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:08,824
# <i>And I'm afraid I had to</i>
<i>rake 'em across the coals</i>

584
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,833
# <i>Yes, I've had the odd complaint</i>

585
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,734
# <i>But on the whole I've been a saint</i>

586
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:18,832
# <i>To those poor unfortunate souls</i> #

587
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,934
Now, here's the deal.

588
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:26,210
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

589
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,843
Got that? Three days.

590
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,683
Now, listen, this is important.

591
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,121
Before the sun sets on the third day,

592
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:38,628
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

593
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,597
That is, he's got to kiss you.

594
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:47,126
Not just any kiss,
the kiss of true love.

595
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:50,935
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day,

596
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:55,001
you'll remain human permanently.

597
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,571
But if he doesn't, you'll turn
back into a mermaid...

598
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,743
and... you belong to me!

599
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,619
No, Ariel! [muffled]

600
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,055
Have we got a deal?

601
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,389
If I become human,

602
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,225
I'll never be with
my father or sisters again.

603
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,595
That's right!

604
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,931
But you'll have your man.

605
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:24,373
[chuckles] Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?

606
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,238
[cackles]

607
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,576
Oh! And there is one more thing.

608
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,208
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.

609
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,309
You can't get something for nothing.

610
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,820
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.

611
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:42,086
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

612
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,596
What I want from you is... your voice.

613
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:50,794
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.

614
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:54,497
No more talking, singing. Zip!

615
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,563
But without my voice, how can I...

616
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,508
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.

617
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:05,639
And don't underestimate the
importance of body language!

618
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:06,672
Ha!

619
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,651
# <i>The men up there</i>

620

621

I think I'd better go see
what Louis is up to.

797
00:54:22,405 --> 00:54:26,432
Come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man!

798
00:54:26,509 --> 00:54:29,103
- Louis!
- Ow.

799
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:34,206
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was just, uh...

- I'm sorry, <i>madame.</i>
- [huffs]

801
00:54:38,588 --> 00:54:41,523
You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy

802
00:54:41,591 --> 00:54:44,185
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.

803
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,194
Something in the way of a tour.

804
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:49,288
[chuckles] I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

805
00:54:49,365 --> 00:54:52,459
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.

806
00:54:52,535 --> 00:54:54,730
- Do something. Have a life.
- Shh!

807
00:54:54,804 --> 00:54:56,738
- Get your mind off...
- Easy, Grim, easy.

808
00:54:56,806 --> 00:55:00,037
It's not a bad idea,
if she's interested.

809
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:01,474
Well, what do ya say?

810
00:55:01,544 --> 00:55:04,638
Would you like to join me on
a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

811
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:09,879
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

812
00:55:17,994 --> 00:55:19,928
- [Max barks]
- [whistles] Come here, boy.

- [barks]
- [Eric growls]

814
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:40,274
This has got to be, without a doubt,

815
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:44,844
the single most humiliating
day of my life.

816
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:50,416
I hope that you appreciate what I go
through for you, young lady.

817
00:55:50,493 --> 00:55:54,520
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

818
00:55:54,597 --> 00:55:59,694
Tomorrow when he takes you for that
ride, you gotta look your best.

819
00:55:59,802 --> 00:56:04,296
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.

820
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:09,642
You gotta pucker up your lips,
like this.

821
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:15,042
Hmm.

822
00:56:19,689 --> 00:56:24,956
You are hopeless, child. You know that?

823
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:28,657
Completely hopeless. [yawns]

824
00:56:37,173 --> 00:56:38,572
Any sign of them?

825
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:41,735
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.

826
00:56:41,811 --> 00:56:45,144
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

827
00:56:45,214 --> 00:56:49,446
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned,
no coral unexplored.

828
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,683
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

829
00:56:53,756 --> 00:56:55,747
Yes, sire.

830
00:56:57,026 --> 00:57:02,328
[Triton] Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

831
00:57:26,715 --> 00:57:28,080
Has he kissed her yet?

832
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,584
- Not yet.
- Oh!

833

Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?

837
00:57:56,846 --> 00:57:59,314
No, not yet.

838
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:01,815
Well, they'd better get crackin'!

[whinnies]

[Flounder] Move over.
Move your big feathers.

841
00:58:32,982 --> 00:58:34,677
I can't see a thing.

842
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,913
[Scuttle] Nothing is happening.

843
00:58:37,987 --> 00:58:43,254
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

844
00:58:43,325 --> 00:58:49,821
OK. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.

845
00:58:49,899 --> 00:58:52,925
- Stand back!

Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.

You want something done
you've got to do it yourself.

First we got to create the mood.

Percussion.

Strings. Winds.

856
00:59:30,806 --> 00:59:33,104

Maybe I could guess. Is it Mildred?

[laughs] OK, no.

I just wanted to wish ya luck.

I'll catch ya later. I wouldn't miss it!

[Grimsby] Well, now, Eric.
