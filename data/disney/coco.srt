Hector! Hector?

1303
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,740
She's forgetting me.

1304
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:29,020
- Who?
- My daughter.

1305
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,880
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1306
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,380
I just wanted
to see her again.

1307
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:42,070
I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.

1308

I wish I could apologize.

1309
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:49,130
I wish I could tell her that her

That's my <i>Mama</i> Coco.

Coco in the living world...

1322
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,440
I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.

1323
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,160

1324
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:11,950
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

from the living world...

You know,
I wrote her a song once.

1330

We used to sing it every
night at the same time.

No matter
how far apart we were.

remembers, not de la Cruz!

1348

I didn't write <i>Remember Me</i>
for the world.
