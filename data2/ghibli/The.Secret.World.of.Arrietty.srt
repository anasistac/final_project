1
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,148
I'll never forget that summer.

2
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:27,736
I spent a week in the old house
where my mother grew up.

3
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,133
Almost there. Feeling all right?

4
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,384
Yes.

5
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,629
Haru... how many times have I told her?

6
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,216
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

7
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,640
Haru!

8
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,267
You're blocking the driveway again.

9
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,565
Sho?

10
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,400
Where are you?

11
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,644
Don't touch!

12
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,773
These aren't for you.

13
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,088
-Arrietty!
-What?

14
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,133
You went outside again, didn't you?

15
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,928
And you might clean up
this room, young lady.

16
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,638
It's my own little garden.

17
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,642
If you ask me, it looks like a mess.

18
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,895
Oh! Is that a bay leaf?

19
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:23,031
Oh well, I guess this means
your birthday comes early.

20
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,163
Enough for a whole year.

21
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,875
But the bay tree's so far away.

22
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,085
If a human being saw you...

23
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,004
I'm always careful.

24
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,966
The world is full of dangerous creatures.

25
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,303
Your great uncle...

26
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,930
...was eaten by a frog. Right?

27
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,892
Doesn't that shiso smell lovely?

28
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,019
Yes, it does.

29
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,565
With a bit of sugar
I could make shiso juice.

30
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,196
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.

31
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:09,202
My first borrowing ever!
I've been practicing night and day.

32
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,162
Papa's home.

33
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,461
Welcome back.

34
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,801
-Papa, about tonight...
-There's a boy in the house.

35
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,804
I saw him.

36
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,848
-No! Arrietty...
-He didn't see me!

37
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:36,229
I hid behind the bay leaf.
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?

38
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,940
I won't hear of it. It's too dangerous.

39
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,567
But he's just a child!

40
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,196
Papa, I've been waiting
for such a long time.

41
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,324
The children can be more savage
than the grownups.

42
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,576
I'll be fine!

43
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,666
Youngsters go to bed early.

44
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,210
Thank you Papa!

45
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,045
But Pod...

46
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,507
The boy's sick.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

47
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,591
But still...

48
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,388
Stop worrying, Mother.
We'll be extra careful.

49
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,102
Arrietty will be 14 soon.

50
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:20,231
Someday she'll have to
survive without our help.

51
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:24,610
Sometimes I think
we're the last Borrowers in the world.

52
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,931
Whatever you need, just ask Haru.

53
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,016
All right.

54
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,059
Haru, I'm depending on you.

55
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,145
Yes ma'am.

56
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,447
Let's shut the screen. Keep the bugs out.

57
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:10,740
Oh?

58
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,912
Shouldn't you wear something darker?

59
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,081
I already decided!

60
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,836
I hope you can borrow some tissue paper.

61
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,714
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?

62
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,843
We could have shiso juice
and sugar for the tea.

63
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,181
But anything's just fine.

64
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,061
We'll be back soon.

65
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,189
-Please be careful.
-We will.

66
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,431
Arrietty!

67
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,618
Sorry!

68
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,285
-Hold these for me.
-Yes, Papa.

69
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,196
Hold on tight!

70
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,326
Arrietty?

71
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,495
-Ready?
-Yes.

72
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,541
Everything's so huge!

73
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,960
The world of human beings.

74
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,087
The sugar's over there.

75
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,760
Wait for me down there.

76
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,142
Papa, you're great!

77
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,687
Now let's get that tissue.

78
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,083
Papa, look.

79
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,920
Your first borrowing.

80
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,798
Be careful, it's sharp.

81
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,966
I will!

82
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,531
Papa, borrowing is such fun!

83
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,496
Look down there.

84
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,048
Rats. Steer clear of them.
They're trouble.

85
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,758
I'm not afraid.

86
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm ready for anything. I've got this!

87
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,433
Sometimes it's best not to
go looking for danger.

88
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,606
What is this place?

89
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,652
Human beings made it for their dolls.

90
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,287
It's just perfect for us!

91
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.

92
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,669
These things aren't for borrowing.

93
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,713
If anything went missing
they'd know right away.

94
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:53,966
Oh...

95
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,066
Don't be afraid.

96
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,628
I saw you.

97
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,675
In the garden. It was you, wasn't it?

98
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,934
My mother told me about you.

99
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,814
She saw little people here
when she was young.

100
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,277
Was it you that she saw?

101
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,072
Was it?

102
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,746
I'm sorry, Papa.

103
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,332
He saw me today, out in the garden.

104
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,336
I should've been more careful.

105
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,880
I hope he didn't frighten you.

106
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,052
Best not tell your mother,
it will only worry her.

107
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,720
All right.

108
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:19,856
You don't always have to run.
Observe them first, then decide.

109
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,038
We're home.

110
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,082
Safe and sound.

111
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,512
And...?

112
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,473
Things didn't go well this time.

113
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,685
This light gave out before we finished.

114
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,020
Oh dear.

115
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,607
We had to give up on the sugar.

116
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,736
Don't give it a thought.
At least you're safe and sound.

117
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:12,033
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your first borrowing.

118
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,003
What a pretty pin.

119
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,091
Time for bed.

120
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,933
Good night.

121
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,191
She looks worn out.

122
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,985
Shall I make some tea?

123
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,848
Sho!

124
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,768
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.

125
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,481
A cube of sugar? But whatever for?

126
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,275
He left it by the grating.

127
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,654
It's probably the same one
I dropped last night.

128
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,448
What?

129
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,201
What do you mean, you dropped it?

130
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,333
Don't touch it. Do you understand?

131
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,380
It's a trap.

132
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,758
They're trying to catch us!

133
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,512
We'll have to stop borrowing for a while.

134
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,515
Maybe they already know where we are.

135
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,392
Pod, we'll have to move!

136
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,272
This was such a lovely house.

137
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,691
Now we'll have to start all over again.

138
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,404
Well, let's see how things go.

139
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,656
Now eat, soup's getting cold.

140
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,910
Why did it have to be sugar?

141
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,392
Thank you Arrietty.

142
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,395
I wanted to hang everything
while the sun's out.

143
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,316
You know I love doing laundry.

144
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,783
-I'm going to nap for a bit.
-All right.

145
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,410
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING

146
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,414
You came back.

147
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,252
Wait, don't go.

148
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,383
Please leave us alone.

149
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,011
I wanted to tell you that.

150
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,389
I want to talk to you.

151
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,059
Human beings are dangerous.

152
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:07,230
If we're seen, we have to leave.
My parents said so.

153
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,442
You have a family? I envy you.

154
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,695
Don't you have one?

155
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:19,158
Yes, but I practically
never see my father.

156
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,787
Mother's so busy at work,
she barely has time for me.

157
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,081
Really...

158
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,921
My name's Sho. What's your name?

159
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,676
Do you have one?

160
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,138
Of course I have a name!

161
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,931
It's Arrietty.

162
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,893
Arrietty... Arrietty...

163
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,938
That's pretty.

164
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,708
Won't you let me see you?
Just for a moment.

165
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,176
Just a peek. Please?

166
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,313
What's happening? Oh my gosh, it's a crow!

167
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,571
You can't come in here!

168
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,674
What got into that bird?
They never behave like that.

169
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,510
Maybe it's nesting season or something.

170
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:51,560
Now I have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?

171
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,729
Are you all right?

172
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,900
Maybe you should take
some of your medicine.

173
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,986
Thanks, Haru.

174
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,737
I feel fine.

175
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,789
The nesting season, eh?

176
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,800
Have yourself a nice long rest now.

177
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,028
Papa...

178
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,117
-I told you to stay away.
-I'm sorry.

179
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,079
I wanted to do something to help.

180
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,790
But he didn't see me.

181
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,127
You put your family in danger.

182
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,256
I won't say it again. Understand?

183
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,758
Yes.

184
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,812
We'd better start looking.

185
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,775
It's time.

186
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,280
Pod...

187
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:28,259
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING

188
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,316
Afternoon! Package for you.

189
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,780
Thanks again ma'am.
It's pretty hot out there.

190
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,951
Listen, know any good
pest control companies?

191
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,619
Pest control?

192
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:02,042
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service."

193
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,504
Squeaky Klean Service?
Let me just write that down.

194
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,843
Having problems with mice?

195
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,639
Maybe it's mice,
or maybe it's something else.

196
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,769
Between us, it's little people.

197
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,354
I've seen them myself.

198
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,198
A crow tried to fly into your room?

199
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,325
I hope it didn't scare you.

200
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,953
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out.

201
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,500
I was so astonished!

202
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,668
I never saw such a huge...

203
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,380
Excitement's the worst thing
in the world for his heart.

204
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,467
He came here for peace and quiet.

205
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,554
If anything were to happen
before the operation...

206
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,640
I know, I know.

207
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,229
I realize his mother's
terribly busy at work.

208
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,398
But to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child?

209
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,403
It must be terribly hard for you
without your mother.

210
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,906
I don't mind.

211
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,409
I suppose the divorce couldn't be helped.

212
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:22,164
But why can't she be here,
when he needs her so?

213
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,884
Aunt Sadako, who made
that little house in my room?

214
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,511
It's amazing.

215
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,930
You mean the doll house?

216
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,100
That doll house belongs to your mother.

217
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,603
She left it here when she moved out.

218
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,688
It was hers?

219
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:50,401
My father had it made to order in England.

220
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,778
It was for the little people.

221
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,616
My father claimed he'd seen them.

222
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,368
He waited for so many years.

223
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,665
He always said that house
was a present for them.

224
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,961
But I'm afraid they never
showed themselves again.

225
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,881
Not in my father's lifetime, nor in mine.

226
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:18,012
Young Master, did you happen to see
any little people in your room?

227
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,642
Unfortunately... no.

228
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,147
It's been in our family
for four generations.

229
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,276
If you like it, it will be yours someday.

230
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,069
You mean it?

231
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,487
Yes.

232
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:40,576
Have you looked inside?
It's quite beautiful!

233
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,792
-Haru, could you turn off the lights?
-Yes'm.

234
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,264
This is the living room.

235
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,436
All the furnishings were hand made
by a real furniture maker.

236
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,065
Isn't it wonderful?

237
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:16,570
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a bathroom.

238
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:21,575
But the next room is my personal favorite.

239
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,578
Haru, could you open that up?

240
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,498
Let's see, I think it opens this way.

241
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,837
Everything is so detailed!

242
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,383
Detailed and just like the real thing.

243
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,595
That's a real oven.
You could use it for baking.

244
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,098
Beautiful, just beautiful.

245
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,809
What a pity Father's dream
never came true.

246
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,727
And it's been so long...

247
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:52,147
Maybe the little people are gone now.

248
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,750
Mother, we've had
these pictures three years.

249
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,960
Don't you want new ones?

250
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,213
I love those pictures.

251
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,175
I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.

252
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,513
Besides, there's no point
changing them now.

253
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,727
Papa's later than usual.

254
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,648
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.

255
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,406
-Papa?
-That's the back door.

256
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,578
Papa! Welcome back...

257
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,665
Twisted my leg.

258
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,834
It's lucky Spiller found me.

259
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,341
Pod?

260
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:10,929
Oh dear, you're hurt! Hurry, bring him in.

261
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,600
Does it hurt?

262
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,978
It's not broken. I'll be fine in no time.

263
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,189
I'll get some cold water.

264
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,861
Here's a towel, better dry off.

265
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,071
Who's this?

266
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,455
It's not just the three of us after all.

267
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,465
Gotta go.

268
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,468
Wait, at least stay and have some tea.

269
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:01,897
I'll see to your father.
Get Spiller a cup of tea.

270
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,856
Okay.

271
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,069
Thank you Spiller.
Papa's so lucky you came along.

272
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,949
We're so grateful for your help.

273
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,620
Listen, have you seen other Borrowers?

274
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:20,457
You see, we thought
we might be the only ones left.

275
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,212
This many.

276
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,049
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay!

277
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,594
Can I see your bow?

278
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,852
You use this for hunting.

279
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,860
Give that back. It's not a toy.

280
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,836
Gotta go.

281
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,966
Won't you stay and have a bite?

282
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,970
Got this.

283
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,183
A cricket's leg!

284
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,271
Want some? It's real good.

285
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,188
No thanks!

286
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:30,902
Take care.

287
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,030
Thanks again.

288
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,369
I'll see him out.

289
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,462
You were looking for a new place.

290
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,884
I tripped and fell. Couldn't move.
Then Spiller came.

291
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,260
Really...

292
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,014
His territory reaches past the river.

293
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:03,769
And he knows a few places we could live.

294
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,396
That's good I suppose.

295
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,150
I'd hate to camp out.

296
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:15,655
But I doubt we'll find anything
quite as nice as this.

297
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,913
I'm glad there are still others like us.

298
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,999
Do you have friends and family, Spiller?

299
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,377
Family? No, just me.

300
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,839
Well, I hope you can come again.

301
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,926
My mother's stew is the best in the world.

302
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,450
Haru?

303
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,472
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be closer together.

304
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,016
Pull it apart and do it again.

305
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,730
Why do we need such a big sack anyway?

306
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,948
I'm going to look in on Papa.

307
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,952
Papa, can I come in?

308
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,332
How's your leg?

309
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,542
I'll be walking soon.

310
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,045
Papa?

311
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,132
Are we going to move?

312
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,887
We were seen. We've no choice but to move.

313
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,436
I don't think every
human being is dangerous.

314
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,147
Arrietty...

315
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:59,069
Before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.

316
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,572
One family went missing.
They just disappeared.

317
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,449
The other one moved away.

318
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,826
They were seen by humans.

319
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,956
No matter what happens,
we've got to survive.

320
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,832
Papa...

321
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:33,061
What in heaven's name!
Is this an earthquake?

322
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,712
Mother!

323
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,924
It won't open.

324
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,097
The frame's buckled.

325
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,953
The... the wall!

326
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,365
Homily!

327
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,660
Homily!

328
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:18,041
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.

329
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,357
This again?

330
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,817
Gather only the things we need.

331
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,286
We can't carry all that.

332
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:40,165
And Homily, take nothing
from the doll house.

333
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,169
I'll make sure it's safe.

334
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,338
-Stay with your mother.
-Yes, Papa.

335
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,331
You finally came.

336
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,093
Do you like your new kitchen?

337
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,139
Our house is a disaster.

338
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,478
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye.

339
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,943
Can I look?

340
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,802
You're beautiful.

341
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,140
We have to move.

342
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,060
We were seen.

343
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,605
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

344
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,399
Borrowers...?

345
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,318
We borrow from human beings.

346
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,696
Things we need. Things they won't miss.

347
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,950
Soap and cookies and sugar.
Electricity and gas, too.

348
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,662
Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower.

349
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,124
No one ever saw them?

350
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,251
Probably.

351
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,214
It's all my fault.

352
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,177
Niya, don't be like that. Be nice to her.

353
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:03,808
Are there other little people
like you in the house?

354
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,979
No, it's just my father and mother and me.

355
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,939
What about in other houses?

356
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,152
I'm sure there are some.
I've only met one so far.

357
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:15,820
Oh.

358
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,617
Soon you'll be the only one left.

359
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,704
Every year there's fewer of you, right?

360
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,791
You're a doomed species, you know.

361
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,629
That's not true!

362
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:36,007
There's lots more of us. Spiller said so!

363
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,800
Spiller?

364
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,886
He's one of us.

365
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:43,097
And he said there's lots more.

366
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:49,437
Do you know how many people
there are in the world?

367
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,524
There are 6.7 billion of us.

368
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,527
Six point seven billion...?

369
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,655
What about you?

370
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,865
I don't know.

371
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,160
There's probably just a few of you.

372
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:08,414
Until my mom told me,
I didn't know little people existed.

373
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,170
Lots of species are already extinct.

374
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,799
I've only seen them in books, though.

375
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,594
So many beautiful species...

376
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,764
But the environment changed,
so they died out.

377
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:30,144
It's sad, but that's what fate
has in store for your kind.

378
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,398
Fate, you say?

379
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:38,820
You're the one who changed things.
Now we have to move away.

380
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,949
We have to survive. That's what Papa said.

381
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,827
So we're leaving,
even though it's dangerous.

382
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:52,375
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!

383
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,753
We're not going to die out that easily!

384
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,509
I'm sorry. You're right.

385
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,762
I'm the one who's going to die.

386
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,811
It's my heart.

387
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,107
They're going to operate next week,
but it's probably hopeless.

388
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,567
Your heart...?

389
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,197
I've always been sick.
I can't play like other kids.

390
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:28,619
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to protect you.

391
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,872
I can't even do that.

392
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,958
I hope you can forgive me.

393
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,337
I didn't know you were so sick.

394
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,364
What in the world is this doing here?

395
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:10,411
What?

396
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,436
It's the kitchen from the doll house!

397
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,663
Found you!

398
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,419
What's wrong?

399
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:04,340
My mother... I heard her voice.

400
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,499
This really is a great kitchen.

401
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,169
You're not the only
little one here, I bet.

402
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:05,860
I have to go.

403
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,484
Help!

404
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,200
Help!

405
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:57,161
Let me out! Help me!

406
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:24,981
There we go.

407
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,650
Please, let me out!

408
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:30,695
Please!

409
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,398
The ceiling's tilted.

410
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,110
Hello?

411
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,404
-Hello? Squeaky Klean Service?
-Yes.

412
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:40,032
-I have an emergency.
-For extermination?

413
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,868
There's something small
in the house. No, not mice.

414
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,370
Not mice?

415
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,122
I don't want them killed.

416
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,290
You need trapping services?

417
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,335
Yes, that's it. I want you to trap them.

418
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:05,432
Sho! Sho!

419
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,936
Arrietty!

420
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,026
Mother's gone!

421
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:21,115
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human being got her!

422
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,581
Momma...

423
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,217
We'll find her.

424
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,376
What?

425
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:16,921
It's locked.

426
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:23,093
Let's try the room next door.

427
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,240
Can't budge it.

428
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,491
Wait!

429
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:56,919
I can fit.

430
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,455
Amazing!

431
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,493
No, that's not it.

432
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:15,831
There's a dirt road. Turn in there.

433
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:19,126
-Before the bridge?
-No, not that one!

434
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,969
Haru opened this.

435
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,681
Then she must've taken Mother someplace.

436
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,636
Are you okay?

437
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:23,565
What's taking them so long?

438
01:13:57,474 --> 01:14:00,060
Mother! Where are you?

439
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,162
But the lock...

440
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,038
Lock?

441
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,585
Could I have some hot milk?

442
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,671
Okay, wait just a minute.

443
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:38,348
Thanks.

444
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:19,806
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?

445
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,523
Mother!

446
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:30,442
Mother!

447
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,494
-Mother?
-Arrietty!

448
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,962
Here I am, Arrietty!

449
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,421
Mother!

450
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,094
Arrietty!

451
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:28,458
There they are.
They finally found the right road.

452
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:51,940
Another human being!

453
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,446
It's all right, Mother.

454
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:24,222
We'd like to take a look around first.

455
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:25,474
Take your time.

456
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,207
SQUEAKY KLEAN SERVICE

457
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,542
Now who can this be?

458
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,878
-Don't be too rough.
-Haru?

459
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:56,421
-Haru!
-Yes?

460
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:00,133
What's going on here?

461
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:04,221
It's finally happened.
The little people are here!

462
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:05,430
Little people?

463
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,183
That's right.

464
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:10,435
And what little thieves they are!

465
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,617
It's really true.

466
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:33,125
They steal from all over the house.

467
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,628
That's why things were going missing.

468
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,339
Haru, what's gotten into you?

469
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,968
All these years I thought
it was my imagination.

470
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,720
Well, it wasn't.

471
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:49,224
You certainly didn't need
to call the exterminators.

472
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:53,478
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!

473
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,482
You'll believe me when you see this.

474
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,444
This is their nest.

475
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:03,572
Nest?

476
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:12,581
It looks like a pile of old junk to me.

477
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,754
What? I swear I saw it.

478
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:23,341
Haru, I'm sending the exterminators away.

479
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,886
Now, wait just a minute.

480
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,139
The doll house!

481
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:40,108
Young Master? May we come in for a minute?

482
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,067
All right.

483
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:55,957
You won't believe this.
They stole the little kitchen too.

484
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,462
You'll see, it's gone.

485
01:20:04,424 --> 01:20:05,342
It's not gone.

486
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,636
Such a pleasure to look at.

487
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:24,861
Wait, I can prove it!
I have one of them in a jar.

488
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:30,867
I wonder what's gotten into Haru.

489
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,160
Hmm?

490
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,832
Fresh herbs, how lovely.

491
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:53,890
Someone was making tea!

492
01:20:56,017 --> 01:21:00,188
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.

493
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,693
Yes, there are.

494
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:08,446
So Haru really saw them.

495
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,199
Though she accused them of stealing.

496
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,578
They're not thieves at all!
They're Borrowers.

497
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,207
I mean, I wish I could see them.

498
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:23,712
I bet they're here somewhere.

499
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:30,176
I'm sure they are.

500
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,610
Excuse me, ma'am!

501
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,404
Where'd you like us to start?

502
01:21:58,204 --> 01:21:59,915
Are you all right?

503
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,628
It got away.

504
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:07,255
I had one and it got away!

505
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,301
It's not just my imagination.
There are little people here!

506
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:14,846
Next time I swear I'll get them!

507
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:33,823
How far is it to where
we're meeting Spiller?

508
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:38,286
It's just outside the forest.
Then we head down river.

509
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:44,751
I'm already worn out.
I'll never make it that far.

510
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,101
Let's hurry.

511
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,020
I can't do it...

512
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,343
Better have something to eat.
We'll be walking till morning.

513
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:36,428
What?

514
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,015
I'm so sorry.

515
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:45,729
It's my fault we had to leave
such a wonderful house.

516
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,317
That's in the past.

517
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:56,531
We'll make another wonderful house,
the three of us together.

518
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,456
I'm going outside for a bit.

519
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,876
Don't go too far, now.

520
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:44,621
Niya!

521
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:56,109
Niya...

522
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,588
Just a little further.

523
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:41,029
Spiller!

524
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:57,420
That's everything.

525
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,882
Now let's get moving.

526
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:02,342
Okay.

527
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,015
Mother, are you all right?

528
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:22,528
Arrietty!

529
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:54,227
Sho!

530
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,482
Arrietty...

531
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,962
We're leaving now.

532
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:27,593
I'm glad I made it.

533
01:28:31,931 --> 01:28:33,808
Niya showed me the way.

534
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:44,277
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

535
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:52,076
I brought this.

536
01:28:58,249 --> 01:29:01,294
I hope you'll accept it this time.

537
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:08,593
Thank you.

538
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,275
I have to go.

539
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:27,653
When is your operation?

540
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,697
The day after tomorrow.

541
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:34,494
I'm going to be okay.
You gave me the courage to live.

542
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:44,879
For luck.

543
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:51,219
Thanks.

544
01:29:58,392 --> 01:30:00,603
You protected me after all.

545
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:04,273
Arrietty...

546
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:09,654
I hope you have the best life ever.

547
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:13,908
Goodbye.

548
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:22,416
Arrietty, you're a part of me now.

549
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,795
I'll never forget you, ever.

550
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:46,983
I'm fourteen years old, I'm pretty

551
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:52,780
A light-hearted little lady

552
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:57,577
For a long time, under the floor

553
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:05,126
I've been living as a Borrower

554
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:12,884
Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue

555
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:17,263
I'd love to meet somebody

556
01:31:17,346 --> 01:31:19,849
I want to feel the wind in my hair

557
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:23,144
And to gaze at the sky

558
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:27,648
I want to bring you a flower

559
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:31,277
It's a different world out there

560
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,113
Look, butterflies are dancing

561
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:38,618
Waiting for me

562
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:44,081
Yes, nothing ever changes

563
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:50,129
In my little world

564
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:57,470
It's not that I hate it
But I want to know

565
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,642
More and more about you

566
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:09,023
My happiness and sadness always

567
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:13,069
Get mixed up with each other

568
01:32:13,152 --> 01:32:15,863
I want to feel the wind in my hair

569
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:18,908
And to gaze at the sky

570
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,162
I want to bring you a flower

571
01:32:23,996 --> 01:32:26,540
It's a different world out there

572
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:30,086
Look, butterflies are dancing

573
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:34,382
Waiting for you

574
01:32:57,738 --> 01:33:00,449
Under the sun

575
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:03,452
And surrounded by flowers

576
01:33:03,869 --> 01:33:07,915
I want to spend the days with you

577
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:11,711
With these memories in my heart

578
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:14,839
I'll live my own way

579
01:33:15,047 --> 01:33:19,218
In a new world

580
01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:05,848
THE END
